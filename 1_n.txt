It suddenly can't turn on days ago.
A non working product. Just west of time and energy. Well they refund my money but I don't recommend this product.
Does not turn off.
Did not work in Italy
Please don't buy this. I used this for just 3 or 4 times and now started getting coil burning smell when I turn it on. It should go to trash now.
Problems using with uk adaptor
This unit caught on fire within 3 months of purchase
Blew out coils after 2 weeks of use.
It wasn't as I expected.<br />I HAD TO RETURN IT.
I only got to use it 1.5 times when I was in the middle of using it the second time when it sparked and burned out.... I would like a refund but don't know how to go about it. I used to have one that lasted for 10 years befo re ti burned out
Doesn't fold!!!!!
Stopped working after 3 months.
Simply doesn't work!
over priced junk
This i gave as gift & it blew up within one month!!!!
I want to  return this because it does not have a plug.
I couldn't find a blow dryer this would stay on without popping off. I went through about 5 different ones.
I didn't receive the straightening pic that came with the dryer.
I returned it.
Broke after 2 uses. But It couldnt be returned because I was in a different country
dvice work with 110 ac and my home 220  also not writ in amazon abut ac tks
The hood collapses. The hood does not stay mounted
"Quit heating after 60 days,"
Can't bla the company but this item does not work. It falls off with the suction cups and can cause issues. Save your money.
Stopped working in 5 weeks
I purchased the product for its retractable cord and this did not work. Would not recommend
died after about 6 months of use
It did not work
Broke after using it for two weeks
"I don't remember why I sent this back, but I think it was because it did not fold up closely enough. ML"
"Worked for a while. Then, it broke. I bought it a month ago. DO NOT BUY IT!"
It only worked for 6 weeks.
Burning smell had to return it after use
Did not stay on.
It's like holding a jackhammer !
there is Spark fire come from inside I think this is defective one
returned it
Could never get the wattage adjusted -- cracked the handle before it was used.
i need to exchange it for another hair dryer
"ordered purple, got red/pink. plus my hair get caught in the intake"
Must have got a dud but ours died!
It did not fir my hair dryer.
nunca recibi el producto. me gustaria que me repusieran el dinero por favor
Hair dryer blew up the third time I used it!
I just received this in the Mail yesterday and there is a short in the wire and it sparks...WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Died as soon as it was plugged in, despite having it on the correct power setting."
It was damaged when received. Now I have to pay to return it.
Terrible....lasted only 6 months. Only used this like 1-3 times a week.
Used it three times and it died!
"Lasted 9 months ... purchased December 14, 2013 .. Died September 25 2014.  What happened to the hair dryers that used to go for 10 years?  This one the cord started heating up and then it just stopped working.  Probably the 4th hair dryer I've bought my wife in 5 years ... I guess they are just a disposable item now."
It does not give enough power using the 220v
"I have never rated this product by given it a 5 star; and I have never wrote a review for this product!<br />Thank you,<br />Ms. Marlene Farrell-Trent"
Broke after two months. Heat function no longer functions.
causes circulate every time!
The unit started smoking today when in use.  The built in GFCI fried after just over a months use.
Handle would spark when turning on and off
This item broke in the second time I used. I am totally returning it.
Says quiet on description however it was the loudest hair dryer ever!  They should remove quiet from the description!
Motor went out after only a couple uses.
The blow dryer blew out the second I plugged it into the wall.
"Bespoke Labs sent me an 1800 watt model.  My wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived, so I never had a chance to dispute Bespoke Labs shipping me the wrong item.  She likes it and continues using it, and I must admit it does the job quite well, but it was not what I ordered and not what I paid the premium for.  Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received."
"At first it was great, but after about 6 months the dryer randomly stopped working and now, not even a year old has stopped working completely :("
i have only had this for alittle over a month and it broke today. will never buy another one from here.
On and off switch broke after one week of using it.High heat was not that hot.When using it smelled as if something was burning.Would not recommend to buy.
The Hair Dryer died on us after using it for a month. All style but no substance with this product. The slide switch almost came off and will not work. No air for my hair! The only thing that worked well on this dryer was the night light.<br />Not recommended unless you want to throw money away.
"Took it to Europe, plugged it into 220V, and it started smoking immediately.<br /><br />it never worked. It obviously is not dual voltage."
I bought this item for my elderly mother.<br />She and others have tried to use it but<br />the hose keeps coming detached from the<br />bonnet.<br />I would not purchase this product again<br />or recommend it.
I plug it and it doesn't work. Just bought it and I never used it before. What do I do with it.
2/28/2013
1/10/2013
I can't believe you would send me an appliance that uses 110V. I cannot use this hairdryer as I cannot plug it in. Australia has 240V. Do you have an adaptor that converts 240V to110V?
I bought 2 of these because I thought they were very similar to what I had before.  Each lasted about 2 uses before I heard something break inside and they would no longer turn on.  No matter how low the price do not buy this hair dryer!
"This product should have come with a warning.  Even on the LOW setting, one can get a third degree burn from the heat."
"I recieved this hair dryer last night and this morning it does not work.  The heating element came on,  but no air."
They last only about 30 days. Only using about 15 mins a day. this is the second one. I will not buy again.
This item did not work out of the box. I returned it. Should be no stars.
"Size was good for a travel dryer and worked well for about 6 months until the handle literally started melting from the inside. I noticed that it was slowly getting hot and over a matter of weeks there was a melted hole in the handle. I live in the US so there's no issue of changing voltage, etc. Worst and most dangerous purchase of my life. Pay a little more money and try something else."
"Does not  last.  Flew apart in pieces one afternoon while using it.  I am a guy and only use it a few minutes a day.  Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  Not worth $49.  Never had a fan blade split apart like this dryer."
"After two months it just keeps overheating! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off. I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair. Not very powerful, a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill."
"I have used this Revlon Hot Air styler for years, but now they have changed the style and I will never buy another one. The new one has air holes above handles which dry your hair too fast and the brushes are too soft and do not grip the hair. I am totally disappointed and saddened I cannot purchase the old style and will not use Revlon stylers anymore."
"Way to loud, and it takes a long time for your hair to dry."
"The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping. Now! on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord. I contacted the company and they immediately got back to me stating that they would send me another bonnet. Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged. The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed. They replied stating they would send me out another one but I realized that if they couldn't get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be. They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products. I'm very disappointed and would never purchase from this company ever again. Never had an issue like this throughout my years of purchasing items through amazon!"
"Altho' they claim to be Dippity Do it doesn't come close. It left my hair very dried out and brittle. I have a bathroom full of barely used jars bottles and tubes looking for the elusive substitute. Hope someone out there can find the formula and market it again. Hurry, my hair is an unruly mess."
I don't understand the positive reviews. Maybe I got a melon? This didn't dry my hair any faster or better then my cheap $30 Revlon dryer and I have thin hair. It just made me sick with the plastic fumes it emitted. I returned this immediately.
"I've bought this hair dryer for international travel.  It is very small, cute and light as shown in the picture.  However, it has one big problem which is that it overheats and completely stops working after a few minutes which makes it useless.... I guess it overheats but I can only partially dry my hair which is not why I bought it."
Cheep in price means bad performence. A little better than air dry. Not hot enough and no air force. I should have not been such a cheep skate and bought the more exspensive one.
"Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.Is something wrong with my hair dryer? Please explain me how to use this hair dryer in detail... Your effort will be very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you :)"
I was very disappointed in this product. Australian power outlets are different to this product. I was able to return it for a refund but the cost to repost it was more than triple the cost of the product. I was only being re embersed for a minimal amount. Where is the product?? on the rubbish shelf in the shed. Would not purchase again.
"It was not quiet and not fast. The supposed ionic function is a bunch of hooey. Fine, for the price I could just say, whatever. The ion thing was just a sales gimmick I fell for. Unfortunately, after a year of moderate use it suddenly developed a stench and then died in about 30 seconds. No, it wasn't clogged with hair or anything like that."
"Actually, I really loved this dryer. It made my hair look super sleek and shiny, dried fast and was very convenient to use. Unfortunately, it broke 2 months and one week after I received it. Basically, I'd used it just shy of two months and I don't dry my hair every day, so we're not talking two months of daily use. The heating element stopped working and now it only blows cold air. Of course, in order to get it repaired I now have to ship it to Florida and also pay them $10 to repair it and ship it back. Seriously, just skip this item and save yourself the trouble. Would be fine if it worked, but a product that doesn't make it even two months just isn't worth the time or money."
Bought this for my mother.  Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone. Finally had to buy a hard bonnet type.
"I purchased this hair dryer because when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, they stocked one in the room and I really liked it - so when I got home I ordered one for myself.  In less than a year, the thing kept cutting out on me.  I would wait several minutes to see if it would work again, but it didn't until I kept blowing on it.  Well today it started making some strange loud crackling sounds.  I was going to blow on it, but decided I didn't want to risk it blowing up in my hand."
I never received it. But went out to get another and hated it. It does not have a warm just hot so I burnt my hair and my childrens to the point my hair is damaged in front. I do not like this product at all. Besides the color I would never let anyone use this product.
"the cord is convenient, but its not long enough. and the power is not strong enough (the blowing action).  i would have returned it but i was moving at the time and didnt have time to do it."
"Had for less than a month before it died.  Loved the size, retractable cord, folding ability.  It's a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn't buy it for that....just it's compact size and retractable cord.  It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!"
Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working today. It just quit. Reset button won't fix it. Very disappointed as I had a much cheaper hairdryer and it lasted years. This has only lasted 3 months!
"This hair dryer is awful!  I have super thick hair and it takes a long time to dry.  I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  When on the 'high' airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds & then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly."
"I was very disappointed in this hairdryer. I tried it out and it seemed to work fine; then when I went to use it, it wouldn't cut on. I smelled smoke and saw sparks. I just returned it and hope to get a replacement soon. Hopefully that one will work better."
This is now the third unit in the last 4 months. #1 bought as a replacement for a 2 year old unit burned up in just a few days. #2 to replace #1 lasted about 2 weeks we are now working on #3 lets see how long it will last. Although I like the convenience of a wall mounted unit if this one burns up I will opt for money back and try another brand.
"This is a piece of junk.  Set it up on the high watt setting, but found that it would not operate after my wife dried her hair. Setting it on the lower watt setting solved the problem for a few months.  Now the same thing often happens and it makes lots of noise.  I think it will stop entirely very soon.  Tried cleaning the lint out several times.  The lint screen is buried under plastic strips making it difficult to clean."
"Came in a beat up box, clearly used even though listed as new. Different watt then listed. Then exploded while I was using it within the first month, luckily I didn't get hurt. Worst hair dryer I have ever bought. Absolute waste of money."
"The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  The dome doesn't fit around your head (or my head) like it does at the salon. The combination of the size of the device as well as the lack of heat that it blows out, make this a bad purchase. I do not recommend and I will be returning it."
"This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn't completely died yet (6 months later), but I'm not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it's adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn't work at all. So I'm not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/18/14: It's dead, Jim. :-("
"I bought two of these dryers.  The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box.  The second developed the same problem within a week.  Frankly, they are dangerous.  Steer clear."
"Sent all eight of them back, they were to bulky and big, looked smaller on line, not what I expected at all."
"I tried to replace my old Conair Dual Voltage Travel Smart hairdryer.  Unfortunately this one was not very much like the old one.  This one is bigger and bulker, weighs quite a bit more, does not come with a carrying case, and does not have a built-in loop with which to hang from a hook. Also, it is supposed to be two speed, but the low speed is too weak and delivers a stream of coolish air.  The high speed is too powerful and delivers an excessively hot stream of air.<br />What a disappointment!!!"
"Not only did I receive the WRONG product, but it was also used when it was supposed to be NEW. I have this exact product at home, so I know what it's supposed to look like. The product that I received did not have the twist handle, and it came with 2 of the same attachments. I bought from Lucky Sales. DO NOT buy from them.<br /><br />I reordered this item from another company and still didn't get what I wanted. It's the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment. Disappointed. Guess I'll just have to order from folica.com."
"Echoing several other one star reviews, mine failed after less than a year of light use.  Quite disappointing because the features and function are otherwise great."
This hair dryer was listed with a &#34;cool shot&#34; which I specifically wanted.  When it arrived I noticed it did not have that feature.  I decided to keep it anyway and plugged it in.  It ran for about 30 seconds and stopped.  Never to run again.  I have another Andis product and it works fine.  I could have paid to ship this item back which seems wrong to me since it was not as advertised.
"I've had this dryer for a little over a year.  Worked well, dried quickly and although not small the dryer is lightweight for its size. But just had a huge scare this morning while drying my hair.  The cord literally broke off from the base sending a flare up of fire into the air and exposing the wires! I've had much cheaper dryer's for years and I've never experienced anything like this. Major safety issue and now i have a $100 dryer thats unusable after a little more then a year.  I have a message into Amazon.com but i suspect since its been a little over a year any warranty that was offered is no longer valid.  I'll update this review when i get a response.  (As far as its use, it was used about 5x per week and although it had a long cord I used it right by the outlet so it wasn't stretch or tugged.  The cord did get twisted up much easier then far cheaper dryers and other appliances and this may have contributed to the problem.)"
Do not buy this Hair Dryer.  I have it since May 2014 and it stops working after a few minutes and will not turn back on.  Conair wants me to ship it to Arizona at my expense and send them $7.00 to ship it back.  Since I paid about $20.00 for the hair dryer it is not worth it to replace it when I can buy another brand.
This blow dryer doesn't have a cord retieval like ohter Andis dryers do. The cord is thin and very long. For storage after daily use I wrap the cord around the dryer or handle part. After only a few weeks I've noticed that the cord is becoming kinked. It's only a matter or time before it's shorting out.
"The velvety outer coating on the hairdryer started to peel off after about three weeks. It rubbed off around the handle and nozzle, flinging bits of the paint (or whatever that was) into my hair and on my floor-- one day I tried to just rub all of it off but it just made a bigger mess.<br /><br />The dryer itself was just fine, just that damn clear coating paint looked awful and got all over the place. The only thing I can liken it to is one of those clear facial masks that you can peel off. I ended up having to buy a new hairdryer a month after buying this one.<br /><br />Buy another model."
"The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn't long or very thick , it's ear length. It isn't a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that's about it! 馃槖"
"Don't waste another minute of your life looking at this piece of junk.  I am VERY disappointed.      First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I've used on such a small device.  My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size.  My son's book shelves used smaller holes than these things!  Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw.  So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!     Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)!  Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what's the point?    My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.  Do your self a favor and look somewhere else!"
"To be fair, I cannot actually review the dryer itself. I received the dryer with the diffuser attachment missing, which renders it pretty much useless for me. I also received a black & purple dryer, which is not a big deal, but receiving an item that does not include attachments included in the description & a different color when it was not stated that colors may vary, makes me wonder whats happening in quality control. Frustrating."
"After limited use in 5 months, the unit only works on low.<br />Will need to get a replacement."
"I am a professional hairstylist. I cant believe how crappy this deal is!  Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly( I already own a real one), wanted to return it. I called them and told them it was fake and they said I could return it for a refund. They e- mailed a rma# and I sent it back. Well a month has gone by and they claim they havent recieved it and wont even try to help me find it. Yeah right. Total scam because I called them out for being fake. They wanted to exchange but I was adamant on a refund. I guess they didnt like that. Losers. Dont do it!"
Not as powerful as advertised.  Air force is weak.  For price you get what you get.
"The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer. That feature only worked marginally well for about four weeks and thereafter stopped working at all. If you are looking for a retractable cord to save space, don't even consider this product. I have three operative dryers at home. This was to be for my motor home. Waste of money!"
"I purchased this hair dryer on February 27th. The heating element stopped working on June 3rd (so it worked for only 3 months.) It will blow air, but not hot air. Returns not allowed after 30 days."
This dumb dryer was underused and it overheated. When I bought it only good reviews were to be found. Now I see plenty of dissatisfied customer reviews. Well I can add mine to all of theirs. Don't but this dryer. A cheap dryer I've had since a teenager still works and this one broke after 10 months of use at maybe 2 mins of use per day. My husband used it and he doesn't have long hair.... Very disappointed in this product. Seller would not take it back.
I had purchased this dryer before and absolutely loved it until it died. I have been very disappointed with the one I received and would have sent it back if I had not thrown out all the packaging. The attachment it comes with- which directs the air and was one of the main reasons I liked it- will not stay on. :(
I bought this. Broke. Decided to give a second chance because I loved how compact it is and it is off counter. I have had a new one for 4 mos now and my 2nd one broke. Says I cannot return so now I am out 2 dryers and spent over $70 - will never buy another one. Terrible product
"Two words: noisy and dangerous!<br />It is not necessary to explain noisy...<br />Dangerous because the inner part is definitely not well protected.<br />Besides that, it takes too long to dry a hair that should had being completely dried in 5 minutes.<br />I send my back."
"I've had this blow dryer for just over a year, and it finally started smoking and sparking so bad, I believe it would have caught on fire if I didn't turn it off.  For the last 6months, if not longer,  I've noticed that when I 1st turn it on it smells really hot and the air flow is very low.  But after fiddling with the heat controls and the cool button it will gradually begin to blow at the normal flow.  I've used cheaper blow dryers in the past that I get a minimum of 3-5 yrs out of!!!!  I'ts the weekend and Andis is closed, but I'll attempt to contact them to see if there is anything that they are willing to do, refund/repair or even replace this unit.  Please note that on their website over half of their blow dryers seem to be discontinued, hmm wonder why. I'll update my review once I hear, or don't hear back from this company."
doesn't even work i dont know why i've kept mine for so long... oh well
It never worked. Not dual voltage as it is said to be. Will never buy any electric item from Amazon again. Epic waste of my money
It was much larger than I expected as it was to be used for travel.
Not al all what I expected. Low air output.
This item is pink and it is not clearly advertised as such.
I ordered the product pictured (Andis 1600W wall mount hair dryer) to replace a similar unit that I have been very happy with.  I was sent a different product that does not match the pictured product and has multiple cords protruding from the base and is unusable to me.  Amazon's rules are that it has to be returned unopened and I ripped the packaging before I realized the wrong product was sent.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.
"I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing."
"I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  At least their's restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM."
I was pleased when I first received this dryer.  But after struggling with it I now realize it is a bust.  The flexible tube fits into the bonnet with such a tiny turn that it is impossible to keep the tube there.  You must hold onto the tube or it falls out.  And it gets so hot it is difficult to hold.  I thought it  would get easier to use after a few tries but it is hopeless.  I hope no one else gets conned into buying this.  If it hadn't been for struggling with some surgery I would have returned this long ago.
"This is the third Andis Hangup Hairdryer I have bought and the problem is the same in each one, the switch!  I just bought this last  one less than a month ago and the on/off switch is already giving me trouble. This will definitely be the last one regardless of its convenience."
"Shipment was missing a piece. It took forever for them to figure out what piece i was missing. Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town. Apparently they overlooked that part of the email. Hopefully they sent the right piece. This review is based on the customer service, not on whether the product works well."
"I ordered this hair dryer to use for travel. The first time I used it, it caught on fire!  The manufacturer reluctantly exchanged it for a new hair dryer because it was after the return parameters. Really?  It caught on fire!  The replacement went on a trip to Europe with me and the VERY FIRST TIME I attempted to use it, it AGAIN CAUGHT ON FIRE! I'm lucky it didn't catch my hair on fire...and the worst that happened was a burn hole in the hotel towel!  Very scary.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
This is a LAME hair drier. Take a long time to dry my hair - has no power. The settings dont function correctly either.<br />Don't cheap out - you get what you pay for in this case.
This is NOT a true diffuser. A real diffuser does not blow your hair; it heats your hair.  This blows your hair like a regular blow dryer. I returned it after a few tries.
Product is not the color described. Supposed to be black and white but is actually purple. Not what I ordered.
"When the product arrived the back peice was open but I popped it back on. It works good to dry hair like in the salon. However after about 4 uses, yes four,4, it started smoking from the back and never came back on. There was no warranty info in the box. Ive contacted the seller so I guess ill see what happens. Its been basically a month of owning this crap and it doesnt work anymore. Total waste of my money. Im very upset."
Quit after a few months.  I bought this blow dryer because the one I was using was 10 years old & could reasonably be expected to die soon.  The old one is still working.  This one is dead.
The on off switch is broken. The only way to turn it on is by pressing white button on plug and turn it off by unplugging.  Not what I normally expect from an Amazon or Revlon product.
This thing is junk.  Got it for my wife after her other wall mounted hair dryer died.  She hates it.  Not enough power.
don't waist your time or money on this one.<br /><br />This POS is only used for an hour every other week.  My $10.00 Braun one lasted 7 years
"I would NOT recommend this item, the wall mounting system is poor. The screws utilized to mount dryer to the wall bracket failed on the first turn. Additionally, the night light stopped working after 1 day."
So heavy I felt like I was lifting weights. This went back the same day.
The box to the dryer was open it was missing the coupon that it was supposed to include. It might have been used. It was definitely opened...
"DANGEROUS!!!<br />This hair dryer is SO NOT WORTH YOUR $$$$!!!  As reported by other reviewers the flat sliding on/off switch was difficult to operate, especially if your hands were not totally dry.  The folding handle stopped staying open after 6mo.  This created a significant pinching hazard.  After 9mo the dryer began to over heat each time it was used."
"Well i first wrote this product was AMAZING, until having it for a few months.  This hairdryer keeps on shutting off !!! Soooo annoying!  Prob not even real BaByliss"
"Had to return after the first time I used the Product, the hose burned off the bonnet connection was impossible to dry my hair with this product. Very loud and only dries one section of your head."
This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months. Stopped working after that! I didn't realize there was a warranty card at the back of the user information booklet so I never sent it in. They won't replace this $80.00 hair dryer now. Very disappointed!!!
I would have gone with 0 stars if I had that option. I gave this to my daughter for her semester in Spain. She said it overheated this first time she used it and has been afraid to use it again. So this product was basically a complete waste of money. The bad part is I got an email saying the first one I ordered wasn't coming so I ordered a second. The first one came as well as the second. I didn't need a blow dryer to use in the states so now I have one that can't be used and I that I don't want
"THE DRYER WORKED GREAT FOR MY HAIR. I SELDOMLY USED IT AND I NEVER DROPPED IT. WHILE USING IT ONE DAY, THE MOTOR EXPLODED FROM THE BACK OF THE DRYER AND HIT ME IN THE FACE. I TURNED IT ON AND HEARD A STRANGE NOISE. SO NATURALLY, I DECIDED TO TURN IT OFF TO SEE WHAT COULD BE WRONG. BEFORE I COULD TURN IT OFF, IT HAD ALREADY EXPLODED AND SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE DRYER! PIECES OF THE DRYER HIT ME IN THE FACE. QUITE HARD! I DON'T KNOW IF THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE OR IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL DRYER. CAUTION TO ALL!"
"The description states there is a cool shot button, but there is NO COOL SHOT BUTTON! Amazon, PLEASE correct this misleading description. I wanted a small, no-heat air blower for medical purposes. This dryer seemed to be the closest thing. I'm returning it, but what a waste of time!"
"I bought this Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer to save space and for company convenience. It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used. The Jerdon hair dryer was purchased in August 2010 and quit working in March 2011. It's not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......After 60 days NO RETURN! If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item. Sometimes when you think you are saving money, you're not. I lost all the way around. I will not purchase electrical items from Amazon in the future. Bad idea!"
"Terrible product.  Cheaply made, loud and doesn't have much power.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Save your money and buy the Onel MK-II.."
"I purchased this to use for travel. As in, only occasional use. I've had it for about a year but have only actually used it a handful of times. This weekend I brought it on a trip. I plugged it in, and after only a few seconds, the wind died. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried again. Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died. What a pile of crap. Andis owes me damages for the emotional trauma of suffering through an entire weekend with bad hair. Don't waste your money."
"The Elchim dryer is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is loud, controls are not easy to use, heavy and  no filters.  My current dryer is 10 years old and IS a professional model, much nicer.  I gave this one to our Abused Women's Center.  In asking beauty salons about it I did not find one hair stylist that was familiar with the name or had used it.  DON'T WASTE your money on this one, it is a piece of junk."
"This is probably the worst hairdryer I have purchased in my 31 years of living. It is super heavy and doesn't even blow hot air. I would not recommend and am super sad because I threw the box away and cannot return it. Based on all the positive reviews, I thought I would love it, but I was VERY wrong."
"Burned out the first time I used it with 220 voltage!  Worse than wasting my money, I was without a hair dryer/diffuser for my entire 3-week trip.  I was furious because the reason I bought it to begin with was that I NEEDED it to dry and style my curly hair!  It was beyond the 30 day return window, so it was a total waste of $50+!!"
"Well I had to put a 1 star on this because of the seller.  I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &#34;business&#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller."
"I'm a big fan of con air and ION dryers in general. However, I'm disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.<br /><br />1) The styling attachment falls off 5-6 times during any blow dry. The latch or ability to attach is minimal. While blowdrying your hair, expect it to go flying and fall to the floor. Extremely frustrating and annoying<br /><br />2) The coord is very short. Unless you have an outlet right by your mirror and from waist-level or higher, you will need an extension coord to use this dryer."
Died after only a dozen or less uses.  Smoke and electrical smell from unit.
"This is the most horrible hair dryer I have ever owned. The hose would not stay connected to the bonnet. It kept slipping off. I have only used the dryer one time. Will not use it again. If the dryer was more expensive, I would have sent it back."
"I used this dryer only a couple of times. Then when I turned it on it made a strange humming noise, started smoking, and there were flames firing up inside the unit. Yikes! I What a waste of money."
"I purchased this item less than 3 months ago. After using the product for about 4 weeks, I noticed that the handle got incredibly hot...too hot for me to hold without it burning my hand. Today, less than 12 weeks after purchasing, the hair dryer started smoking and completely shut down. Needless to say, I am very disappointed."
"When I received this dryer I found it a little heavy and the air flow was too strong. Also the buttons are in a weird location  but since it was the second dryer I ordered from Amazon I decided to keep it. Big mistake! Last week it started to eat my hair. I have long hair and the exhaust end of the dryer grabs my hair and rips it off my head. I don't know why this started after a month but now it is too late to return it. Doesn't matter, I won't use it again."
I ordered this hair dryer the begining of August 2010 and it now only works on low speed.  My box is long gone in the garbage and it is past my return refund date. Help!
"After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!"
"Yes, I was tricked into leaving a good review so that I would qualify for a replacement if the hair dryer broke within 2 years.  Now that I've had a while to use it, I found out it's JUNK, COUNTERFEIT, BOGUS, FAKE, GARBAGE, etc.  It is definitely not a genuine T3 hair dryer!  I pulled out my original T3 which makes a funny noise now, but it drys my hair in 1/2 the time that this new phony one does.  My daughter also has a authentic T3 and when she came to visit, she used my new one.  She immediately knew something was wrong with it and in fact got really angry because it dryed her hair so slowly she was late going out that night.  Amazon really needs to put a stop to people to obviously sell horrible knock-offs!  These people will eventually give Amazon a bad name and people will refrain from using their site to order things.  Convenience will mean nothing if the products are worthless.  If you have to again buy another hair dryer, you've ended up spending much more than going to a reputable store."
"I purchased this blow dryer November 5, 2013. Today is October 14, 2014. The heating element died. I have not dropped or abused this dryer. I expected at this price for it to last longer than a cheap dryer but I am disappointed. I will go back to buying the $20 Conair dryers because other than the price I don't find a difference."
"I like the fact that the dryer is very light weight, but I think I have used toy versions that blow harder. OMG.... I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, and use it in the salon, and it caused me to run way behind. Every client I gave up after 15-30 min and used another dryer. I think it is comparable to using a diffuser to get a strait sleek look.... unfortunately I'm not impressed. I'm sending it back."
The ground fault circuit interrupter (the little red button) never worked and so the dryer never worked either. It was designed so that the GFCI couldn't be opened or repaired.<br />This was a total waste of money. Of course we never used it until the day AFTER the return date expired.
"This dryer no longer includes the straightener attachment as pictured and referred to by previous customers.  It is also black and white.  I got one that had item number 121PR, returned it, and got the same thing with the item number 121PX.  Be aware this item is not as shown.  I did not try it because it was wrong."
Sending it back.  Blows too hard on high....needs another speed besides low.
"I thought this would be easier to use than a conventional hair dryer that blows my hair around a bit too much.  My mother had a similar-looking hair dryer MANY years ago and I thought this would work just as well for quick styling, avoiding the need to blow dry using a brush.  I was wrong.  This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can't quite decide it wants to be running.  I should have known I would not get much quality for this price but I didn't think it would be quite so awful.  I will probably donate it to Goodwill, as I think it might be functional, but it does not do what I wanted."
"I purchased the Yellowbird in September.  I only used it two or three times a week, and by January it was broken.  The heating element died and now it only blows cold air. I should have kept the cheap hair dryer I've had since high school.  What a waste of money!"
"I have short curly hair that is both course & thick. Was hoping this could replace my hair dryer & diffuser combo and assumed it would be more compact. Unfortunately, this is almost just as bulky and doesn't distribute enough heat to curl/scrunch my hair WHILE simultaneously drying. I would've been better off letting my hair air-dry, which is a horrible look for me. In the process of sending this back."
The Heat guard attachment constantly pops off & there's nothing you can do about it. Don't waste your money
Only used for few months and already quit working.
Not the drying power expected
I had expected a cordless dryer.....that is what I had asked for. I returned the product
this shampoo never worked for my dandruff. even when my hair was wet i can still see the dandruff. this shampoo doesnt work
"its been a month and the hair dryer stop working, dont know what happen it just stop working and letting me hair wet"
"You know this WILL actually dry your hair pretty quickly. CONSIDERING IT RIPS IT OUT WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE BACK OF IT! Who designed this thing-Marques De Sade- seriously I wasn't even trying to dry my hair - I was using for shrinkwrapping the windows , when BAM! the damn thing sucks in my hair in a whirlwind of pain. That's when it is actually working , I know that its normal for it to go between hi and low power, but after less than 20 seconds its like&#34; can I take a break now?, Drying and ripping hair out is HARD!&#34; - it sucks- literally - maybe buy it for someone you secretly hate and would like to see bald."
Don't believe the &#34;High-velocity airflow&#34; statement - this hair dryer only had a low & medium setting.  I don't have what people would call a thick head of hair and it took a long time for me to dry what I have.  The hair brush was flimsy and the bristles were mangled when I received it.  Another thing I didn't like was that it is quite heavy and the handle is long so it makes it seem even heavier when you are holding it.  I ended up returning it since it was pretty useless to to.
Product arrived very poorly packed.  The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy.  Would like a new one!  Very disappointed with my purchase![[ASIN:B000LQB5YS T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]
"I once recommended this dryer and should have changed my review years ago. The retractable cord feature on the one I bought initially very soon failed. I contacted Andis and they sent me another one, but it failed in the same way. I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again. I no longer possess this product and could not recommend it."
Because the blower dryer is not 3000wAtts is only 1800watts. And for the type of hair I work is not strong.
Not a good buy... Nothing like the ion brand!! Doesn't get hot enough to dry thick hair!!! Only good for short thin hair maybe!!!
"I bought this on the recommendation of my stylist and I hate it.  The hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp, the &#34;power&#34; is too strong and makes my hair completely flat and yet, doesn't seem to dry it unless it's on these higher settings.  Also, it is a very heavy hair dryer.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Wish I had kept the box to return.  This is not worth the splurge."
Only used it for 2 weeks. The bottom piece would get too hot! I got burned a couple times and it also melted my extension cord because of the heat. Total disappointment!
The unit probably does tame friz but it leaves my hair totally flat. The cord gets stuck all the time and is too short even all the way out. The unit is heavy to use. Gave it away after two uses.
"This dryer can't compare at all to past hair dryers.  It is hard to adjust and very noisy.  It took me a few attempts to finally find a way to sit under this dryer without it knocking out my rollers or making me sit in very uncomfortable positions.  Hard to adjust on my own, had to have my husband fix it for me."
"Do not buy this.  Bought mine in Sept o1, 2014. Went to  dry my hair last night, Nov 8 , 2014, would not turn on. Only used this dryer maybe 6 times, only blow dry my hair if  washed late at night. To late to return to Amazon.  Six uses that is it.  It does have a reset and test  buttons which I  pressed several times. Still the dryer would not turn on. Not happy that I spent $40.00 for a hair dryer that I used only six times."
"I have had this hair dryer for just over a year - 379 days to be exact and this morning when I went to turn it on, no dice. Dead. I have had ConAir hair dryers that have cost $20 last longer than this one,so to say I'm unhappy is an understatement! I don't even use it everyday- maybe 3 times per week AND last summer, I left it while I traveled for over 2 months, so the life of this this thing was seriously short. BEWARE~"
"Just got it.<br />It broke right after the first use.<br />I tried putting it in different sockets, still didn't work. &#62;.&#62; Horrible defective product."
I sent it back.  Basically not worth it.  Heavy - cord did not retract all the way -- not what I was looking for.
"I would give it zero stars if I could but unfortunately that is not an option. I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire. I strongly do not recommend anyone to buy this product."
Died within a couple months. I am so disappointed in the failing quality of Conair products. Do the controls really need to be under our fingers the whole time?
"I bought two of these in March of 2011.  Within 12 months the first one died.  This morning, after 32 months of use, the second one caught fire in my wife's hand.  These are not a quality product and are even dangerous."
"This dryer lasted a total of 3, light-duty, months before it died.  I contacted the company who said they'd bend the rules and allow me to send them $55.00 for a replacement.  They said that the vendor who sold the dryer through Amazon was not an authorized seller and they had no way of knowing the condition of the product when I received it.  So, long story short, not a good experience with T3.  It was underpowered when it was working. I don't trust a company who values customer satisfaction so little."
"This is the WORST hair dryer that I have ever had. The one that Andis quit making, and I guess replaced it with this thing, was SOOOOOOO much better than this punny thing. Anything can blow harder than this one, it's terrible. The nozzle (I guess that's what you call it) anyway where the air comes out is so big around, what little air that comes out goes everywhere and you can't style your hair with it. Seems as though when a company comes up with a good product and it sells good, they can't stand it, and then they come up with something in it's place that is terrible and they think people should except their stupidity for making such a mess of things. I have had Andis wall hair dryers for years and loved them but, this one is the poorest excuse for a hair dryer that I have ever had!!!!!! Thank You,<br />Louise Bell"
Don't buy!!! Product sparked fire when turned on before first use!!!!! Very scary. I will be returning this product. And I repeat...Do not buy!!!
"Do not order this product!  My first one lasted 6 months-the fan quit working and it almost caught fire.. Returned it for an exchange.  They sent me an opened item with visible marks, etc.  Guess what?  The same issue again.. No fan, and it smelled like wires were burning.  I have no desire to return or deal with Andis.  This product is dangerous and as far as I am concerned, it is not merchantable.  Do yourself a favor, Stay away from this hair dryer.  It is absolutely no good."
"This dryer features a retractable cord. First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy. Switch for heat control and on and off is supposed to slide up and down, but is hard to operate - does not move easily. and worst of all, didn't dry hair as well as the old conair I had.<br />Next!"
"I'm not sure why the wide range of reviews. I bought this for my wife who has thin blonde hair. Before buying it for her, I noted that many reviewer said it worked for them and they had thick dark hair. There were also reviews of people saying it was way under powered and wouldn't dry their hair. So I can't figure out whether the quality varies from hairdryer to hairdryer or if the raving reviews are bogus. But, the hairdryer my wife received was too weak and took over an hour to dry her shoulder length hair."
Junk! Highly NOT RECOMENDED! It was broke for a week used!
Died within 3 months of use every other day.
Sadly the product broke the first month of use.  I would not recommend purchasing.
"I have used this new dryer not more than 5 times in the past 3 months(since i purchased) and the RETRACTABLE CHORD IS already BROKEN. It keeps retracting even when i want to use the dryer. I have to stand very close to the plug point and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably. Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with. So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility. I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product but it was a bad experience for me. I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable. Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long."
I ordered from Australia so expected a 220-240 volt model. I was sent a 130 volt model which when plugged-in went bang.<br />So cannot review obviously.<br />When I went back to check the voltage it wasn't readily obvious what it was. It took quite a bit of searching to find out I had bought something unusable in Australia.<br />My wife was  looking forward to it so disappointed really.
"I bought this hair dryer in May and ever since I got it, when I turn it on it runs for a while and then it just shuts off , I have to wait between 10 and 15 minutes for it to come back on.  I would really like an exchange and I have not figured out how to contct you.  This hair dryer is still under warranty.  Please advise me what I am supposed to do as this was a pretty expensive hair dryer and it has been cutting out since I got it.  I could not find a way to reach you.  Hoping someone will contact me soon.  Thank you"
"I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways鈥?This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions鈥? but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice鈥? if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return."
The brush on this is like a baby's brush it did not brush through my hair. Terrible don't waste your time buying. Price is great but brush isn't
Product gets way too hot.  The attachment that comes with it does not fit snuggly.  Have used it 3 times since buying it and I am not pleased.  Seriously considering returning it.
i ordered the T3Bespoke Labs hair dryer in 2010- within one year dryer stopped working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with it is no longer under warrenty - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation- i am not happy with this company and would not order from them again- i am now finding out they are an unauthorized dealer for the hairdryer
"No power.  Combs and brushes were not right for my hair.  The ends of the combs were sharp and hurt my scalp.<br /><br />Unusable, should have returned it, but I threw away the box."
"This was a piece of crap.  I used it once where the air flow was so weak I figured I'd have better luck drying my hair if my friend blew on it.  The 2nd time I attempted to use it, it sparked and died.  I left it in a trash can in Paris.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!"
"Heavy, bad temperature and flow control. It is not handy at all.<br />Bay Bliss hair dryer is much better and smaller."
I bought this dryer about a week ago because I've recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning. This is my first time using the dryer and I hate it. The price was reasonable and now I understand why. It is so noisy I can't take it. The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about and now i'm stuck with an overly noisy dryer that I will never use again. If you plan on buying a dryer please please read the product reviews from people who have purchased it. I failed to do that and if I did I wouldn't be stuck with a noisy dryer.
"I bought this for my wife, my comments on the result of purchasing this product a year ago:<br /><br />This is not a good for drying, I don't know why the professional word is on the description, next time tell this is for home use, home result, totally different to result my wife get from beauty med level professional.<br /><br />I'm Disappointed with this purchasing, but the time to send this back and get money back."
"I purchased this item last year and used it once. It worked very well. However, I became pregnant and didn't have time to focus on my hair. When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke. I tried gluing it together but it didn't work. I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while but I guess not.<br /><br />The top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with. Hoping I can find something that will suffice or buy a replacement base. Otherwise, that's $104 down the drain. Not cool..."
Bought this about a year ago and recently it starting having green sparks inside of it and today it stopped blowing warm air. Very disappointed in the quality. Would not but it again.
"Purchased in February 2014 and quit working in November 2014.  I should have heeded the other negative reviews.  And if Amazon were brick and mortar or had a phone number where I could contact them, then possibly we could have at least discussed, and/or they could have offered to replace the dryer with a working one.  It only worked for nine months; come on...."
"I should start by stating my wife was the one that used this dryer so the report of how well it worked is indirect. We gave it 1 star because I couldn't give 0 stars. Don't get me wrong. The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn't buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don't either."
"Did not last nearly as long as it should of, poorly made"
Does not last.  I bought two and they both burned out in a few months time.  It was Waste of money!
I couldn't get the hose to stay attached (locked) to the bonnet. Used it for 30 mins and it fell off at least 5 times. That was enough for me to return it.
"this dryer arrived in an &#34;icky&#34; plastic bag inside the 'banged up' product box.  The cord was unwrapped and stuffed willy-nilly inside the bag.  The dryer had scratches and smudges on it.  It had obviously been used and returned.  There was no instruction manual included, either.  The dryer may be a good dryer but I didn't want to touch an obviously used personal item.  I am just appalled that such a product was sent to a customer.  Very disappointed."
"I bought this expensive T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer 2.9 pound from TheDiscountCenter. I was guaranteed that it had a 2 year warranty and that they would replace it should anything go wrong with it. Upon arrival it had a broken diffuser. They replaced it. I continued to use the hairdryer and then it eventually stopped working while still under warranty. I contacted TheDiscountCenter to replace the hairdryer. They ignored several emails. I then filed a complaint with Amazon who has also been unhelpful. I am in the process of filing a complaint with headquarters and the Better Business Bureau. Please know that when I contacted T3 direct to see if they would honor the warranty, they said the serial number was a counterfeit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THEDISCOUNTCENTER, they are liars who are selling counterfeit products through Amazon. What is even worse is that Amazon was notified about this seller back in September and they continue to let them sell products through the website!"
The cord was hanging down and my puppies chewed it to pieces. Used one time what a was of my money
"The concentration attachment falls off repeatedly, and I mean every time I use the dang thing. Another deal breaker is the length of the cord, it's way too short. This blow dryer is going to be replaced."
I had this hair dryer only a month and it has stop working. If I send it back I only get half of my money back on this worthless dryer.
ABSOLOUTLEY USELESS. WAS SENT DRYER FOR USE WITH AMERICAN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY!!! TO USE WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY MASSIVE TRANSFORMER.SCRAPPED IT AND PUT IT DOWN TO EXPERIENCE
We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.'  There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.
"over heats quickly, do not recomment"
The motor blew out after a year and a half
"I bought this in April, by the beginning of June the heating element went. I was drying my hair...turned off dryer to bring my daughter to the bus...walked back in -  turned on the dryer and there was no heat. ridiculous."
I wish I could have read reviews on this product before I bought it.  <br />It was very difficult to put back into its case.  <br />I only used it a few times. The last time it just shut off and never would start again. I would not recommend this product.
"This had both good and bad reviews, so i figured i would give it a try. Mistake. Worst shaver ever. I had to take off the plastic piece and just use the blades to make the hair short enough, and it worked for about 2 minutes, and then suddenly all it did was PULL the hair and HURT!!! Don't waste your money."
"Ordered this and upon arrival the dryer stopped working. It would turn on and work for a few seconds and then overheat. Not pleased with this purchase. I have used similar Andis dryers in the past without problem, this one was a dud."
Does not work with longer hair. The blow dryer sucks the hair in thru the fan and can burn it and cause damage. That's what happened to me and my daughter who both have long hair.
Low speed is not very low.  It blows away my hair.  Had to go back to old hair dryer.  Very disappointed.
The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.<br /><br />The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.
I was just using what I thought was my trusty dryer when it literally BLEW UP in my hand.  Sparks went flying and there were pieces as far as 10 ft away. The entire back of the dryer exploded.  I have never been so scared of an appliance.  I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them.  Please do not buy this- it's very dangerous!
Purchased to replace an older Conair 1875.  The GFCI plug on this unit failed after 45 days of normal use.<br /><br />In the future I will look for a dryer with a UL safety listing.<br /><br />Too bad Conair is diluting their brand with this junk.
It's hard for me to believe this is an Ionic conditioning hair dryer. It made my hair dry & frizzy. Nowhere on the dryer itself does it say it's an ionic dryer which made me think the listing is incorrect.
"This dryer is deafeningly loud, heavy and unwieldy, and none of the attachments fit. It's a terrible piece of machinery. Don't waste your money."
"Bought this hair dryer in May, 2013.  After about 9 mos. of use, I noticed that the fan speed suddenly dropped to its slowest speed eventhough the setting was for the highest.  Then, I saw tiny little sparks inside the hair dryer at which point I immediately turned it off!  I've never liked the hair dryer, in part because it's positioned in such an awkward upward angle, causing me to twist my wrist to force the angle down."
This hairdryer shuts off after a few minutes because it gets so hot.  It was  disappointing because I was in Hawaii for a wedding and I couldn't use it. I had to find another one.  Never again.  Waste of money.
"it's not working, never stay on the mirror. Falls down all the time in few hours, and it broke my large mirror last time. I hate it, and I am not going to use it."
Don't waste your money.  I mounted it and it's terrible - loud and doesn't dry hair very well at all..now I have to unmount again.
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did."
Too Heavy.
This hair dryer died within 4 months of buying it. Waste of money.
The heat setting is only two it said it would have four not happy
"I have had this blowdryer for about a year and it already died.  Ironically, it is the most expensive blow dryer I have ever bought and shortest life as well.  Disappointing..."
Doest hold my hair dryer at all no matter how I try to get it in.  Would return but not worth the time or money.  Don't waste your money. Get the handless hairdryer stand they work!
Extremely heavy and noisy.  returned
Broke within a few weeks from date of purchase. Would not recommend.
Not what I expected. The dryer is poorly made.  The nozzle flies off about 3-4 times while I'm drying my hair.  It's very annoying!  I will most likely return.
"We just received the package and opened it. My husband tried out the retractable cord and it doesn't retract. Waste of time and money, and shipping costs as well."
This thing died within a month of purchase. Bought it for the girlfriend to use when she visited. So it wasn't even everyday use for that month.
My wife purchased this hairdryer 6 months ago to replace her T3 and it now only blows cold air. The heating element does not function. We contacted the seller for warranty information and never received a reply. We'd give it zero stars if that was possible.
"I was very disappointed with this dryer.  It essentially was a hand-held dryer with a hanger.  The hanger was completely independent of the dryer.  I thought the hanger would have a plug, but no, the dryer had the plug and a very long cord.  I thought the hanger would turn the dryer off when the dryer was placed in the hanger--no, you just turned the dryer off as you would any hand held.  Save your money and buy a hook to hang your dryer on."
Less than two years of use and this thing just stopped working. Aggravating!
"While the dryer did work well, it lasted only a year before the fan on the motor broke, rendering the hair dryer useless.  In my opinion, this is shoddy workmanship and not worth the money spent.  So, I would recommend finding another hair dryer to purchase rather than this model."
"Unusable .... Bought for Mom to use to dry hair in rollers. The bonnet and closure is so tight and small there is no way to get it on or use it, even with small rollers and a small head!"
"I received the hair dryer, installed in on the wall, and had used it less than two months when the blower went out. Due to a glitch in Amazon's computer system, I was unable to complete the return/replacement procedure, so I am stuck with a broken appliance. Won't buy this item again, and probably won't buy anything like this from Amazon again."
I would not recommend this dryer since it only blows out cold air and takes me thirty minutes to dry out my hair.
"I bought this item and it shipped on June 9. I bought a place and finally got to putting it up July 12.  It didn't work; it didn't even turn on. I went online to Amazon to exchange it for one that worked, but they said my last date to return it was July 11. So I say don't bother buying this piece of crap; and be careful about buying things thru Amazon."
Broke within 2 months.  I would recommend buying a few levels up as I have had those in the past and they do not break.
Lumpy clumpy crap...threw it away and went to CVS to get my usual brand. Waste of money. Does not do what it says.
I bought this hairdryer last year on April 2 from &#34;iShopHappy&#34; and it's already broken...complete with sparks and a terrible burning smell.  Beware for fakes and Chinese junk...when purchasing hairdryers and in life in general. Caveat Emptor!!!
When I received the dryer it was broken.  I was unable to change the speed of the dryer from high to low or use the burst of air.  The button was broken.  I returned the dryer.
"I regret this purchased , 30 days and my dryer stop working.... Bad quality product , not worthy ... GET SOMTHING ELSE . I DONT KNOW HOW PEOPLE RATED SO HIGH"
"I want you to send me a new one.  After 1.5 years of using this, it blew up on me.  This is the worst hair dryer I have ever bought.  Even my conair hair dryer from 15 years ago still works.  Please contact me to send me a new one."
"Don't waste your money. I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She was very disappointed & so was I ! It has only been used or attempted to use just once. After 5 minutes of frustration my daughter gave up trying to dry her hair saying that &#34;it just doesn't get hard or blow hardly any air.&#34;  We're keeping it to blow dry our dog, a small pekingese. Other than that, it's useless.  Again, save your money & skip this product"
Plastic junk.  The speed and heat setting buttons are flimsy and hard to operate. Also the smell of the motor is awful.  On most dryers the smell abates after a few uses.  This one smells as if it's burning.
"Definetely this hair dryer sucks, it did not last not even 30 days. I only used once a day, & it got burned out. I regret not to pay attention to the bad reviews which they were saying the thruth."
I've only had this for about six months and it's goes off and on while I'm using it. Then today after the dryer had been off for over an hour it started humming as if it were &quot;stuck&quot; on. Can't return because it doesn't fall withing amazons return time!!! NOT NOT NOT HAPPY... DO NOT BUY!!!!!
retracting cord did not work after a few days!
"When this arrived i didn't even open it for a couple weeks, but as soon as i went to use it, it only blows cold air!"
I wish I would have read the reviews on this dryer before buying it. I've only used it 4 times. The dryer stopped working after having it on my head for about 5 minutes. I can't believe it actually stopping working in the middle of me drying my hair. This is so unfortunate. Buyer beware!!!!
Purchased this item but was disappointed when the higher setting of 1600W did not work.  There was no noticable change between the 1200W setting and the 1600W setting.  Returned the dryer and will try another brand.
I found the dryer too heavy and bulky for travel and it didn't fold for compact storage.  Skip this one!
"I happened to notice that the base and the handle has dozens upon dozens of cracks in the finish. It looks awful. This product is less than a year old. I have had other hairdryers for years and years with no problems. Since I didn't notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product. Since I don't dry my hair with my glasses on, I guess I lose out by not noticing this flaw within the return policy period. If you don't care how awful the dryer looks after it has been used, this is the product for you. It's a great product but it now looks terrible. The folks at Conair really should step up to the problem and make things right with the consumers."
I have relatively thin hair and this took forever to dry it! I wound up returning it after one use!
"Bonnet is so rediculously small it could not be placed on head of adult, let alone dry hair on rollers.I can't imagine what the &#34;professional&#34; is, certainly not a hair salon with this &#34;quality!&#34;  Disappointing.  Time consuming. Received when I got home 5/7. Diirected by Amazon to be returned by 5/7!  Silly waste."
"I am really disappointed that I can't return this now. Every time I wanted to use it I had to press the reset button, which was doable. But today, it wouldn't even turn on. I heard a faint buzz sound and smelled a toxic chemical smell as if something was burning though I saw no smoke. Waste of money."
"This is the third Andis hang-up dryer I've had.  The first two were great--worked for years.  I bought this one on June 10, 2011.  It lasted until September 8, 2011. It's too late to return it now of course.  So I'm out the money and out of a hair dryer.  Very disappointed!"
"Do not be fooled by all of the fabulous reviews for this dryer.  Mine stopped working completely after less than six months.  I contacted the company and they told me to send it back with a note saying &#34;defective&#34; and my address so they could send a replacement.  I paid $12 shipping to send it to them.  It's been two weeks and I have yet to receive a replacement.  I have contacted the company multiple times since to find out what is going on and I have not received a response.  Terrible hairdryer.  Terrible company.  For all we know, their company representatives could be the ones writing the glowing reviews because I don't know how anyone could actually recommend this product or company.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED."
"I waste my money on it! I have thin hair and this one doesn't work with me, not hot at all! 馃憥"
NOT VERY GOOD
I just hate it! I gave away my Babyliss thinking this one is better. What a mistake!!! When I use it my hair gets opaque. I'm very disappointment and is too late to return it.
"Used item , hair in back of blower , I paid for new item , very disappointed"
I bought this because it was cute and other 1875 watt dryers seemed to do the trick before. This is just awful if you have thick hair. It is very weak and I can hear things popping inside.
Dryer broke during first use between the base and the dryer itself.. It cracked it still worked and dried my hair well however it is made very cheaply with cheap plastic!!:-( :-( :-( :-(
I was extremely disappointed in this hair dryer.  The button on it didn't work properly and I was unable to change amps from 250 to 125 when needed.  It was a total waste of money.
"I had the hair dryer stored away to use when the remodeling was done in my bathroom i would say at least 8 months. I did not even use it 6 times and it just died. I was heart broken. Had i known i would not have stored it away, I would have used it right away. :("
Hard to flex into position.
"I ordered this item as a birthday gift for my wife 3 weeks in advance. I never received the product, but did get a email with a gift certificate for $0.00. I spoke with the vendor twice, once on the phone and once via chat. Both times the conversations were hard to understand and confusing.<br /><br />Stay away from this vendor. You can get this item at KMart for $14.99 (but shipping was $6.95...pick up at store is $0)."
"This hair dryer is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use. It also makes you sit with your face away from the body of the dryer, so it's impossible to work or write while using it. It would have been nice to know this in advance.  All in all It's terrible"
"I bought this hair dryer less than two months ago and it has stopped blowing hot air. I tried cleaning it, adjusting the settings, and pressing the &#34;test&#34; and &#34;reset&#34; buttons on the plug. Very disappointing!"
I purchased the dryer about 9 month ago. It is alway stay at my home in one place. I occasionally used it and never moved it. Now it can not stand anymore. The plastic base and 3 legs are broken. I called the customer service and they said the warranty only for 60 days.
Awful sound and no power.  Returned it.
"Unfortunately, my dryer is broken. When switched to 250, I can not move the heat level passed low. Also, the bristles to the brush arrived bent. I have thick Sicilian hair and the brush does not comb through my curls. I will be returning this product."
I wish I saved the box for this dryer so I can return this dryer. It is so heavy and very difficult to hold when trying to dry my hair.  Also I don't think it has the ionic drying it claims to have.
Took a chance but this does not fit the Conair Folding Handle 1875-Watt Dryer / Model 124TL. The search continues! (And now I'm stuck with this since I just missed the return window!)
"Bought this hairdryer about a year ago. When I was using it the other morning, it went on and off and went on fire. Needless to say, I am not recommending it.  Never had this happen with any hairdryer I've owned.  No stars doesn't seem to be an option, so it gets one by default."
This product is crap. I should have read the reviews! It is so loud you need earplugs to dry your hair. The cord won't retract with out an extended battle. DO NOT BUY!
"The electrical plug was unsteady from day one. Now, less than six weeks later the plug won't stay in the outlet at all.  It has been a little over 30 days so I cannot return it to Amazon.  I am very disappointed."
The hair brush and combs fall off when you use them.The hairdryer specification say it three speed but fails to mention it only works on one speed and one heat setting if used at the 240 voltage!!!!!<br />I feel that the seller fails to mention the limitations... who buys a one speed one heat hair dryer?
"Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  The attachments do not slide on well, it does not dry my hair well, and the bristles on the brush aren't stiff enough.  Unfortunately I missed my window to return the item. I'll have to buy another brand and will just keep this one in the garage if I ever need to blow something dry.  At least it wasn't very expensive."
"I received the item in time, however, it is defective - the hot air does not work, only blows cold air. I have to return it and buy another one. Very disappointed! Do not buy from Maitri Mega Mall."
After one month of use when I turned it on it made a terrible noise and plastic parts starting flying across the room. Vety dangerous. Piece of junk. Price should have been my first clue.
"I ordered this during the holidays, with the knowledge that my current dryer weas gonna go anyday, well it did, and I just opened this and used for two days, it makes a terrible, terrible, humming sound......and I can not return due to that I waited to long to open it and try it now my return date is past."
not good
Not good at all
"Would give zero stars if allowed. The day it arrived, took it out of the box, plugged in and nothing. Just a big puff of smoke that smelled awful. Unplugged and it continued to smoke. Very disappointed in this. Thought I have found a trusted manufacturer and decently priced hair dryer. Back it went for return."
Not recommended.  It doesn't get hot and the comb was flimsy. Very disappointed
"We have bought at least 6 of these....and they all inexplicably die within a matter of one year!!  I should have stopped ordering replacements, lazy on our part so we could just use the same wall mounts.  Time to try another brand!!!"
"Did not work, return policy do not allows you to return. this product was defective, sucks I can not return it. Save your bucks and do not buy it!"
"ANOTHER BLOW DRYER THAT CAUSES FLYAWAY HAIR AND THE FRIZZIES!  I WISH SOMEONE KNEW OF A MINI DRYER THAT ACTUALLY STRAIGHTENS BANGS!  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DRYER DOES NOT DO THE TRICK, I AM SORRY TO SAY!"
Burned out about 4 months after I bought it. Total bummer. I have used Conait hair dryers for years and never had an issue before. This one was a bust :-(
I don't know... Grat price but too weak.
First time I set it up the base where the wheels are cracked! !!
It broke the third time I used it piece of crap
"It was damaged in a couple of months, poor quality"
The exterior of this hair dryer melted and I can no longer use any of the attachments. Poor quality for the price.
Stopped working and almost burned my hair from sparking at the base of the cord. AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS!
this product does not work well ensendido the button came broken and I can not turn off<br /><br />este producto no trabaja bien el boton de ensendido vino roto y no lo puedo apagar
The thing that you put in front isn't their!!! and every time i try to use it it blow half of my hair the other half is flying up!!! hate it!!!
I received this hair dryer on March 23 and it is already broken!  No heat at all.  Not a good deal.
This product was a terrible disappointment. The retractable cord stopped retracting almost the first time I used it.
Broke after a month and a half :(
Very disappointment. I should have read the reviewer before I brought this dryer. Because of the price it caught my attention. but it doesn't dry the back of the hair. Terrible designing!!  That all I have to say.
"Have owned this hairdryer for less than six months, and it has already ceased to work.  Very, very disappointed because I like the style and the size of the unit.  It just stopped working; wasted my money!"
The cold button stuck on the 2nd use.  Now have to have it replaced.  Just annoying to have to deal with this.
"I turned it on and it only blew cold air, even when adjusting the settings. I didn't save my receipt or box. Be warned!!"
"Odd shaped barrel and pathetic power.  Not worth the price, and it wasn't very expensive."
"THE WORST HAIR DRYER EVER!!!!! I bough just 6 months ago and it started to have a weird noise and was not working well and the next time I tried to use it the cable exploded in FIRE, burned my hand and almost caused a fire!!!!!!"
Product description is wrong. There is no &#34;cool shot button&#34;.
I got the wrong one
Useless
Unfortunately I banned it wrong power connection for australia
I had to send two back.  They both were broke.  One ran for about 30 seconds.  :(!!!!
"Hi, I commented that I get the dryer is in the photo with carecteristicas they offer, I feel cheated and very angry, because I rely on information that you published the photo in addition to the product but it is not, the dryer sent me has nothing to do with what they are offering, I feel cheated, robbed.  are a very bad sellers, they offer a product that ultimately can not sell."
my hair looks so dry after i use it. i am very disappointed. i would of returned it but i lost the return slip!
The real sham!!   Save you money!!   Nothing but slick goo on the lips.   NO PLUMPING!!
The bonnet is very tight on my head. There seems to be no way to adjust. Very disappointed. I will be returning.
"Hoy recib铆 el paquete en Venezuela, es un regalo para mi esposa. En el momento de usarlo el producto no funcion贸. Es muy lamentable para m铆 encontrarme con esta situaci贸n. Por favor solicito que se resuelva mi problema. Gracias<br />Today I received the package in Venezuela, is a gift for my wife. At the time of using the product did not work. It is very unfortunate for me to meet this situation. Please I request that my problem is resolved. Thank you"
Bad product started a fire throw yours away
Terrible blowdryer. Scary to use as it sparks.
This was not the product I ordered and was disappointed that it cost me $12.20 to return it.   I feel Amazon should have refunded my postage.  I do thank you for the timely return price of the item itself.    Thank you  Pat Savina
The dryer blows cold air on US settings! Worthless unless you're traveling abroad!
"very bad hair dryer, it stopped working soon."
It's really bad!! It stopped working from the 1st use 
"Horrible, lasted 6 weeks than started sparking flames!<br />Would NOT recommend"
horrible
"Terrible blow dryer!!! It caught fire rite after I turned it on!!! You get what you pay for with this dryer, LITERALLY!!!!!"
"I purchased this dryer for my husband for X-mas it worked well for about 2 months and then started to spark at the cord. My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good. Thank goodness it didn't start a fire!!"
Was a great dryer. Loved it. However it burned out within 2 months.
"This item died after maybe the 10th time i used it. Good thing it is inexpensive. Save your money and dont buy this, keep looking."
Good
"arrived good, after 6 months in used, broked......  It's a shamed that product didn't last...Shamed on you<br />I don'tt have the ticket anymore."
I love it!
"Ordered 2 of the 3500, but received the 3200, which was a lower model, lower priced, by mistake. Somehow, I don't believe that. I feel as if they were trying to see if I would notice the difference. Then when I asked for an exchange, they said they didn't have any more of the 3500s. Sounds fishy to me!"
"Of the two blow dryers that I own, this attachment fits neither."
I was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise. Excellent Excelllent 10 Stars
"I purchased this product about a month ago.  It had good air flow, although I had hoped for more since my travel hair dryer surpasses it in air volume.  However, I thought it was sufficient. Then it just stopped working after about 3 weeks. It was still within the time frame of being returnable, so I did return it and Amazon has refunded me.  I will not repurchase."
Light too bright
Doesn't retract. Very cheaply made. I returned the prodcut.
I love this hair dryer.
"This product does not work well at all. My 19 dollar Conair works better than this.  I made contact with T3 on their website, they stated the store that provided this is not an authorized dealer for this product and my serial number is not recognized in their system."
"It says that it's dual voltage, but it took about a minute to burn out after being plugged into a 220 outlet in 220 mode. Also, the mechanism to switch between voltages requires a screw driver, so make sure to do that BEFORE your trip. Because most of us don't bring screwdrivers when traveling."
"I've always thought that Oster produced great products but not this time.  I purchased this hair dryer in November 2007.  This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  I won't be buying another one of these hair dryers."
"Amazing at first. It gave me natural flawless curls but after a month of using it, it stopped working. I had to re-place it."
"Do not buy. It was great while it lasted, but it shorted out after 3 months of use.<br />Quiet and Seemed to be quality...until its very early smoking, stinking death.<br /><br />Find another that lasts longer."
I bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago.  I wasn't overly impressed with it.  It never seemed to get as hot as my previous T3 dryer and didn't smooth my hair like before.  The topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as I was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm.  I thought $90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn't worth $9!!  Either T3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!
I spent over $100 for a hairdryer.  I used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat.  I wasn't impressed for over $100.
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY AUNT AS A GIFT. SHE WAS VERY EXCITED TO USE IT FOR THE 1ST TIME AND THE DAMN THING NEVER WORKED. SO I HAD TO GET THE DRYER BACK AND MAIL IT FOR A REFUND ...NOT HAPPY AT ALL
"I have had this dryer for almost 2 years.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Today, a flame shot out from it and nearly caught my hair on fire.  It was like a torch.  This is so hazardous!"
"this product did not work at all, it seems to be newand fine but never went on"
"This product quit almost out of the box, returned it to Amazon, the replacement has been working fine. 04/16/2015 I spoke too soon, this one is just like the one before it, fan exploded in a dozen pieces. About 3 months out of warranty. I've had it with this model and manufacturer."
"I got them on time, so credits to Amazon Prime for being fantastic.<br />Unfortunately, the product was defective and didn't work at all. The material used is very cheap, flimsy plastic and the weight of it is disturbingly light. I do not recommend this product even for people who rarely use their hair dryers."
2 out of the 3 attachments don't fit the dryer; very cheap end of what I know Andis is capable of.  You won't be happy with this if you're looking for a professional grade dryer.
"I have not recieved this product so I can't give an accurate review. I would like someone to contact me, it's been over a month since I ordered this product."
"Garbage. Had it for a year, the cheap plastic fan is cracked and it's done."
None available.
I purchased this dryer in August 2013. February 14th the heater element burnt out. Very short life but great when it worked. Wondering how to return or replace?
"The dryer works great. The only problem is the hose won't stay on, it falls off when using it on my clients."
None available.
"I bought this dryer 2 months ago, and even with light use, it has now quit working. Don't buy this - it's junk."
"I'm sure this hair dryer could have been great.  I loved my Yellowbird but unfortunately, this Blackbird would not power on.  The original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks so I had to cancel it and get a refund.  Bummer!"
I really don't understand the good reviews. This dryer feels so cheap and flimsy. Almost break the switch on first use. You have to see it to understand what I am talking about. Don't buy it.
"It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, & that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good.  The dryer doesn't snap in like it should."
"This was for 3 months the Best investment yet for my hair. I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny. However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air. Most disappointing product yet in Amazon I have bought because it worked for awhile so well. I have to purchase a new hair dryer...unfortunately it won't be this one again. As a woman who takes pride in her hair I need something more reliable and safe."
Over heated in 2 minute! We had to return it and had to pay bubble rap to sent it back to Amazon. Good luck if you want to order this through online.
The description for this product is incorrect.  It does not contain a cool shot button.
This is THE LAST time I order anything but books thru Amazon.  I have a major probelm every time.  I ordered the Featherweight Dryer with a Diffuser.  Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  There was NO CONTACT information on the order -- NO PHONE NUMBer -- I called Amazon and got no help at all.  I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.
Worked great when 1st used. small size makes it easy to hold and use.  Quit working after 1 months use.
I hadn't owned this 10 days when it created an electrical issue......the fire department had to come ...I had an electrician come the next day to make sure it was not my electric outlet or circuits and he assured me it was not my electric outlet....he believes it is the dryer.....I would like to return but now am being told by amazon that my window to return has expired.....not impressed with amazon's service....I should add that this is my third one by jerdon....and I have never had any problems previously.....obviously a lemon....would like it replaced for free....with a new one....not a re-serviced one....some one should agree to do that....
"This hair dryer is powerful and does an excellent job. However, I bought one for my wife which I received on January 7th 2014. My wife used it 4 times and then it burned. Literally there was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit. It could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer. But, my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise."
"I ordered two of these and returned them immediately. The suction cups are placed too far apart and will not stay stuck on the tub when I place my head there. If this problem is rectified, it will be a good product. I have used pillows of this style for years with excellent results. These have a flaw in their design which renders them useless."
"I'm amazed that people described this product as heavy. I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced. I'd be stunned if it held up any time at all."
"The unit quit working on the lower setting, and it blows more than it heats and dries.  It has basically quit working. My husband has resumed using our ancient one, which we can no longer hang up (which was my impetus for purchasing a new one).  They just don't make things like they used to.  We just threw it away."
This dryer is very cheaply made.  I used it once; did not work second time. I went to Rite Aid and bought a small Conair travel dryer (which I've had before). Great dryer!
It dosent have hot air!
"Doesn't blow enough air, I need to buy a better one. Great size and I did not have to wait too long to get it."
I was happy with my new dryer but totally burnt after a month use. Lucikly we have not any injuries!!!
"Returned this as the hot was lukewarm at best. I then bought a Conair Infinit Pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise.<br /><br />edited May 19, 2013: Returned the Infiniti Pro as well and bought a Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. As I posted in my review for the Remington (which I didn't buy on Amazon but was so happy with it I wanted to write a review about it):<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn't get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works."
"Works just like the big boys. Same power, light weight. I love it for travel, comes with a nice carry bag."
"This dryer super heats, smells like it is burning and gets so hot on the handle you cannot hold it. It is a fire hazard and should not be sold.<br />Someone is going to get hurt. Since I cannot return it i will put it in the trash. It could burn your hair off or scar you for life.<br />DONT USE IT"
THIS DRYER DOES NOT BLOW VERY STRONG AND TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HAIR TO DRY.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH PRICE IS GOOD.
"The heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses. I am in a protracted effort to get a replacement, although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original. Do not buy this hair dryer! It is unreliable."
"I bought it in May and it blew up in August.  It was used gently on shoulder length hair for short period of time.  Up until the point when it stopped working it was a really good hair dryer.  Relatively quiet, high velocity, and effective."
"Meh, it just doesn't work that well for me.  I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person's head.  Somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head, then sticking out toward the ends.  Not a fan, wish i hadn't tossed the box."
It didn't do much for my hair.  It just feels cool on the scalp if you have braids.  I wouldn't purchase it again.
I'm a hairdresser. I bought this dryer thinking it would last and it broke after only 7 months!!! It was great while it lasted! Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won't fix it because I purchased it through amazon!
"This blow dryer is cute, but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature.  I gave up trying to dry my hair."
"I thought these rollers were really cute but I ended up giving them away. I dont know if its that the heat is uneven or, or maybe the rollers are too small, or what, but I never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these.  I dont think they heat up particularly quickly, either. They might be good for a kid."
Loved this hair dryer when I first received it...now it makes all types of noise and smells....filter is clean so I have no idea what the problem is.  Dryer is totally sealed so can't even open it to see what the problem is....
"Don't buy, product stopped working after using it only 2 times...waste of time and money...very disapointed...had good reviews but certainly didn't live up to them.."
"I plugged it in Turkey and it blew out right away, so I didn't have a hair dryer during my stay there. I am giving it 1 star, since I can't seem to be able to choose 0. The only purpose I bought this dryer for, was to use it in Europe."
I had 2 originals of these hair dryers they worked great for years.  I still have one but one the other one broke I reordered this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months
"I like this dryer.  It's pretty loud as far as hair dryers go and I like that it has three different heat levels but I find that warm isn't warm enough but hot is pretty darn hot.  So hot I can't use it when I dry my childrens' hair.  I use it myself but worry that much heat could be damaging my hair.  Cool shot works well and it's a good weight for a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER:  I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years and I always noticed that the handle was warm.  Well, this morning, it sparked and caught fire.  Needless to say, I'm less than happy.  I've had plenty of other hair dryers that have lasted for many years and even when they ended up breaking, they just stopped working as opposed to almost causing a fire in my house!!!  This is a huge problem.  I have changed my rating.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!"
"The hairdryer had made a strong electric shoot the moment i turned it on, plus i was using it in low tepmreture and it melted the front cover and it was very hot, wont recomend it."
burned up first time used
Giving it one star because I haven't even been able to use it...it blew both fuses on my universal adapter.
"looks good, but stopped working after 3 months, It's beyond producr return time, so I cannot return and waste of money."
Over heated and shut off within the first five minutes of use. Returned to Amazon. Would in no way recommend
"$100+ is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months. Don't bother. If you want to spend the money on a high-end hair dryer, make sure it has a guarantee. This one does not."
"Hi Gang,  I just threw this Hair Dryer away after having it for about two years. It has begun to smoke and smell horrible. I did some research and found out that Bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing. If you bought it here at Amazon they won't touch it.  Hence the circular file...    When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn't like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It's got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.    If you are looking for a top of the line Hair Dryer then keep looking. The Bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn't that well thought out in the first place. Look at one of the other offerings and make sure you get a true warranty."
"This item was a great price and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  It dries my hair in half the time that I was spending with a drugstore brand.  Unfortunately, the tip of the nozzle is melting.  It may be because it's made out of lightweight plastic.  Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance."
"This dryer was a great one during the 8 months that it worked. Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick hair.<br /><br />Usually when I burn up a dryer, I have some notice (burnt motor smell, maybe some popping noises), but not this one. It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work. Checked the outlets, did the test/reset on the dryer and that worked, but the dryer itself is dead. Reviews at other sites show this to be a non-uncommon problem."
"Bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs, and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling, I purchased this item (there was no information about the voltage on product description, but it was available for shipping internationally so I deduced that it is dual voltage). Amazon shipped this item to Singapore (220volts). Once I tried it on, it fried my adaptor plug, and the hairdyer stopped working too after 2 seconds. Such a dissapointment!"
"This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.  It's basically useless."
"I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  However, it stopped working after only two months of moderate use.  Disposable should be added to the product description."
wasn't what I expected.  Thought it would have been more powerful.
"I used this for six months.  I actually liked it during that period of time.  BUT after using it once a day during that time period, it burst into flames and practically exploded while I was using it.  Word to the wise - if your hair dryer starts to smell like garlic DON'T USE IT.  Incredibly dangerous."
"This was a great portable option for travel within the US, however, as soon as I took it out of the country, and switched to the 220V setting and plugged in, it started having issues. The first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment. After that it just stopped blowing unless the &#34;cool&#34; button was pressed. Now that I am back in the US, it is still not back to normal, it barely blows at all, and the light is flickering and unsteady. Very unreliable."
"Great dryer but the first one lasted a couple of months, the second died after about 5 blow drys! So listen to the other reviews, I didn't and now I have to buy another dryer. Update: Tried a third, it died after 3 or so blow drys. Clearly defective model, it can't handle it's own heat."
"I got this blow dryer and returned it within a week. It's a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke. It wouldn't do it on low, but I still felt it was unsafe. It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one."
I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this!
"I was really expecting a great little hair dryer, but it was not.<br />It is super loud and overly hot and makes a bit of a grinding noise.<br />Just really did not like it at all, so I sent it back.<br />Still looking for a quiet, powerful, but not too hot dryer."
Very cheap! Not much blowing power and very little heat. I can not recommend this product. I forgot to mention it is also VERY NOISY! Spend a little more money and get you a good one.   David/Ohio
"I joked that at $10, this hair dryer will be lucky to last one year. It lasted a month. By the time I checked to return it, I had missed the deadline to do so - by one day. Yup. This baby died quickly. Sometimes, you indeed get what you pay for."
"I did really like this hairdryer - I bought it and it worked well, was not too noisy, had some good power. But after less than a month using it 3-4 times per week for 15 minutes, it just suddenly died and no amount of resuscitation would bring it back to life! Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund including shipping - I don't know if it was just a defective one or if it is a common problem with this hair dryer - but that was the end of that. I then went nuts on a $100.00+ salon hair dryer and am quite happy now."
"BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM, PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW! IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!<br /><br />When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.<br /><br />I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &#34;professional,&#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer<br /><br />Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort. The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I've never seen before with a blow-dryer before."
This is not the titanium nano portifino. If it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state. It overheats and has damaged my hair because it is not working correctly. I know this because I also own the true black titanium nano portifino and it's an incredible hair dryer and my fiance is a stylist. Disappointed
Broke after 6 months. One day it just stopped blowing hot air. Cold air works fine. It was great while it lasted.
I got this blow dryer on Christmas of 2011. After a good year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking. I ignored it thinking maybe something was what could I do about it? But then after that in the 3rd month of year two (15 months) I started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head. This brand is supposedly a good brand but I disagree. A blow-dryer should last longer than 15 months. Especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month. I would steer clear here if you don't want to light your hair on fire
This blowdryer caused outages each time I used it so I had to stop and buy a new one!!
"I purchased this item from Super Pharmacy Unica on February 26, 2013.  I received this item at the beginning of March 2013.  I have used this hai rdryer probably six or eight times since receiving.  Yesterday I had to dry my hair ao I turned the dryer on and smoke began to pour out of the on, off switch.  I immediately turned it off .  I sent an email to the seller and I have not received a reply.  I have used Yellowbird hair dryers which I have purchased from other vendors for many years and I have never had a problem with this brand of hair dryer.  Furthermore, this seller has not replied to any of my emails.  I want my money returned so that I can purchase a new Yellowbird hair dryer from a reputable company."
"I bought this dryer expected outstanding results.  It performs no better than any hairdryer I have had.. Matter of fact, maybe not as good...It does not have the blowing power that my   Revlon has, and is not any lighter.  I don't know what all the hype is about this one...Save your money and get a $30 one..I found out they are just as good."
"Upon first use, this item did not blow hot air. On the low flow airflow setting, it blew vaguely warm. On the high airflow setting, it blew cold.<br /><br />When set to low heat, it didn't even pretend."
"Very uncomfortable, I can't have it on for more than 5 minutes. I bought it because it was cheap, but I guess you get what you paid for; a cheap product with cheap quality"
"I've had T3 products before...my last T3 hair dryer lasted 3 years and change. I purchased this one less than 5 months ago and it is already shorting out on me. The dryer simply drops in intensity within a minute of using. Very disappointed.<br />Since the warranty with the seller had already expired (one month!) I contacted T3 Micro for repairs/replacements. Turns out this unit was either refurbished or a knock-off because the serial number on the dryer did NOT match the serial number on the box. And to top it off, both serial numbers were INVALID!! WTF...scam and fraud much!!?? Stay away!"
I bought this dryer last year and loved it. I bought the new generation this year and it simply shuts off and overheats way too soon.
I bought this hairdryer ...twice ...for the retractable cord.  On the  first one I received the cord didn'tretract at all so I returned it and asked for a replacement. I  figured it was a fluke. Replacement was only slightly better. Cord retraction was rough and sporactic. So I returned for a refund. Amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers. So I may have unhappy with the purchases but the return process was a very good experience! It is just a defective design...My husband picked up one at Target and the retractable cord didn't work on it either!
"This hairdryer quit working within one month.  It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!"
"After about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out. Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don't complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.<br /><br />Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set."
does not turn on - very dissapointed
"I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and all the teeth in my comb broke. Now I cannot find a replacement comb. If anyone knows where I can get one, I would appreciate it"
I really liked this dryer so much that I bought a second one.  The problem with both dryers is that after about 18 months of use both have started shotting sparks out once they get heated up.  if you have your receipt you can ship back for a refund.  Seems it is a known issue and they should stop selling or fix the issue.
it costs too much electricity!!!!<br />i have to turn off all the lights when i use this product!!!!<br />it is quite too mass
The brush was really  not made well.  It was not packaged well (the brush).  The vents should be on the top not on the side.  It will catch your hair.
When you turn it on setting 2. Its smells real bad..<br />There are no holes for the heat to come out in the sides. Setting. 1 dose not get very hot..<br />I would not recommend this product to know one..
I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn't even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....
"The motor died after a year of very light use. (2-3x/month). It was a very poor value for the $80 I paid in Sept 2013.<br /><br />I wasn't very impressed even while it was functioning. &#34;Blowout&#34; styling results were not as good as I get with my drugstore cheapie; hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer; poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on/off, high/low by the palm of my hand while I was trying to dry my hair. (Maybe I gripped it funny, but it did annoy me every time I used it)"
"The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down. I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!"
"I think I got a dud it doesn't blow hot heat, my old hair dryer blows more heat to dry hair faster"
"My previous Conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and I loved it.  It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can't, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I've tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!<br /><br />If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.  It last me years and the retractable cord worked great!"
"The product details never mentioned that the dryer has to be hard-wired to an electrical outlet since it doesn't come with a plug.  As a result I returned the dryer because I wanted a traditional plug-in type, however none of the other product reviews mention anything about this so I decided not to order via Amazon until the product details are more accurate."
very loud and have burning smell. from the first use you know it will die soon.
"When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  However, I am returning it for a refund, because one month after getting it, the &#34;hi - lo&#34; switch stopped working and it would only work on &#34;high&#34;.  I thought I could live with that but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  So I don't know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  I was really disappointed though because I was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to."
this blow dryer is good at first but it's quite tricky. The blow dryer begins getting very smokey .. Something about the smell of the blow dryer doesn't seem right . I wish I listened to the reviews because the blow dryer died after one month and a day. A lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer. Very scary . Do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up. Waste of money! Do not buy this item. Going to stick to the cheap blow dryers. This was expensive for no reason perhaps maybe the watts? ( 1900 ) only good thing about this blow dryer it speeds up your drying time a+ for that.
"The dryer was, dare I say it, GREASY. I thought as long as it works, fine. Nope, does not work. The seller, hottest deals, should be ashamed of what they sent for the price I paid."
"It's HUGE!  It was described as more of a travel dryer, but it's way too big to put in a suitcase, and too expensive for quality, cheap looking plastic."
"I took the hair dryer to Asia and while there, I put it on the 220 volt setting and plugged it in.  It worked good on the low fan speed, but, when I put it on high, the hair dryer smoked and immediately burnt up.  I had tested it in the USA on the 110 setting and it seemed to work fine.  This unit in my mind will not work in Asia without burning up.  It was either defective or not engineered to work on 220 volts.  My friend really needs a hair dryer in the morning and was not a happy camper when it burnt up.  I"
"BUYER BEWARE...... I purchased this March 2014 & originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  I reached out to the seller but received no response.  I had purchased this one because I had had a wall mount similar that lasted for years.  I have since ordered a Conair from someone else."
"Bought this to replace my reliable Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hair dryer which lasted over 4 years.  This model is the newer replacement version.  Newer but definitely NOT better. It lasted only 3 months before before it burned out; sparks, smoke and then death. Cheaply made junk!!!"
It's hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 watts. It doesn't get hot at all you can hold it directly towards your scalp and it's only warm. Definitely not worth the money.
very disappointed- i have bought this exact product about 5-6 times over the last 8 years- it was awesome- great heat great weight attractive-etc. but the last 2 i ordered from amazon the plug in design changed and it fits to loosely into the wall socket- and sparks- which is scary- i love the hair dyer itself- but the new design of the plug in is faulty- what can be done?????
"This is my first T3 blow dryer and my last.  I purchased this hair dryer last September at the recommendation of my sister.  Paying over $100 for a blow dryer is a lot in my opinion if you are not a stylist.  It has a cool air button which will not turn off now.  I can't get even warm air to blow out of it.  And by the way, my sister's T3 blow dryer stopped working as well.  NOT WORTH THE $$$$."
This blow dryer stopped heating up after 2 months.  It only blows cool air now.
I like the simple design and compact size of this hair dryer. Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.
"After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out.  This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem.  Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO!"
"I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer."
"Cons: Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.  It doesn't blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.  Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the off when I want it to switch off.  It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.  The back doesn't have a filter, so my hair gets stuck in it if I turn wrong.<br /><br />Pros: It was cheap.  It's lightweight.<br /><br />Just pay $3 more for the better model."
"This is the first 1 star review I have ever written. This blow dryer worked fine for 18 months. However I heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair. She said it was on fire and she had unplugged it. I could smell the burning smell. Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing. But this is a safety issue and the product should be recalled."
"December 2015 Review:<br />Well, despite what I wrote earlier, this blow dryer did not last as long as I'd hoped it would. Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don't rely on all the reviews of &#34;too heavy&#34;, &#34;buttons wrong location&#34;, &#34;too loud&#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself. You do have 30 days to return, although I will not be returning mine."
I thought this blow dryer worked great and I wish I could give it more stars. I was using it today and the power switch broke. It's completely broken and now I have to throw the whole thing away. What a waste of money!
"My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!  I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.  This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !   I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &  it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...   LAST CHANCE T3 !   side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !"
"worked for 5 seconds then stopped working.  due to moving, this disappeared so I couldn't return, but i must have gotten a dud.  I'm going to stick with my regular ionic blow dryer for gentle effective hair drying."
I have used the dryer several times and it works great.  I had questions which were answered promptly by other customers which was helpful in making my decision.  Definitely recommend.
"the first days love it.... I didn't use it every day, just 1 day every other week... after 2 months, it started to smell burned and didn't turn on.... it is trash!!!"
"I used this type of dryer at my brother's house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot, even at a low setting - exactly what I was looking for in a new dryer.    Then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn't get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn't feel powerful at all... My only impression is disappointment. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer."
"I really loved this blow dryer however,  I have only had it for about 5 months and it has just stopped working. I didn't use it everyday either."
I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more. Adjustable? Huh? You can adjust your height under it but no instructions and no intuitive way to adjust the hight of the dryer. I have the more expensive Conair model as well and made the mistake of buying this one to keep at my kids' house for when I visit.
"The first two did not work and were replaced by Amazon. The 3rd one worked for 14 months and then burned up - after turning on by itself in the middle of the night. Luckily, we were home and unplugged it before it caught fire!"
"I had been shopping with Amazon for about 3.5 yrs and never had one instance of a bad experience. After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad. I m very happy with my conair, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax. Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice. I love Amazon as always!!"
"I liked the dryer...while it worked. Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high. Customer service told me i have to mail it back to them and pay for shipping - the new one cost less than the shipping costs! That is if I wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year! So dissapointing"
"After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately.  The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it.  Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned.  Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn't want a replacement.  How it got a UL rating I'll never know.  I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item."
Bought this for a monthly back-packing trip to South America. It broke after a week.  It should not be allowed to operate on High mode in countries with lower voltage.
"We ordered this as a Christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist.  She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  We will need to return it."
"I did not enjoy this product.  It was almost too powerful...yes there is such a thing.  The previous bed head Bh407 model was great, why mess with a good thing.  Returned."
"I received the hair dryer Nov 15 and by the end of January high had totally quit working.  By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so guess I'm stuck with it."
"It was great when it worked, but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months.  So that speaks so much about its quality."
"We have had this hairdryer slightly over a month and now it only works at low speed. When it worked, it worked great. But just a month before a problem? Unacceptable at any price."
Nearly set my hair alight and blew all the sockets in the house!<br />Item RETURNED and refund awaiting! Do not trust it!
"This was purchased for a trip to Italy in February.  Indeed, I am a woman who plans ahead.  I used it Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday it blew out and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  Don't waste your money."
I did not like the design or the size so I sent it back. Pretty clunky-looking and too large for my dinky bathroom.
"I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it I noticed immediately that it didn't really feel like it was drying my hair faster. It actually felt like it took longer than usual. So I went back to Amazon to search for product specifics and couldn't find the wattage for this dryer anywhere. Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a powerful  1300 watts. POWERFUL 1300 WATTS? Are you kidding? No wonder it sucks. Maybe it's good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan. The people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the deal they got. No way would I ever pay $268 for this dryer. The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!"
There is no way to adjust the height of the bonnet.  The high setting will burn your scalp and the low setting takes too long. And this is the top of the line???
The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out. Dead in under two years. I bought it for $26.75 two years ago on Amazon Prime and now it seems tripple the price! How is that even possible?
I didn't even plug in the hairdryer and try it because it was WAY too heavy. There's no way I could hold this thing for more than 1 minute.
As I tolld you before.  This item came broken and had to trash it.  Haven't the foggiest if it was any good or not.
"I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so I purchased it before a trip. I'm not sure why, and I could have ended up with a faulty model, but it broke after being used three times. The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable."
"My last one was a Sunbeam, it lasted 2-3 years. My latest Jerdon stopped working after 6 months. Bummer. It sparked then stopped completely. the dryer didnt have anything preventing it from working (no build up). I plugged it in recently and the lightest setting works but that's it."
Dryer is extremely heavy!  Not as hot or strong as other comparably priced dryers.  Buttons are easy to accidentally press while drying.  Returned it after trying it once.
I would expect a coil cord to re-coil.  This does not.  It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it.  I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord.  I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook.  I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord.  I am returning this defective product.
"I thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord.  First hotel I plugged it in, the power in our room went out.  Second hotel, same thing.  I didn't use it the rest of our trip.  I tried it again when we got home.  As soon as I tried to plug it in it sparked.  In the trash it went.  Big waste of money,"
"Seems great at first, but it's not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it. It's always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force. The second time, it stopped working altogether. Not to mention the hair loss. It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I've ever seen."
"Not enough heat , take long time for long hair drying, have to buy  another one which is more powerful"
Blows air way too hot.  It actually burned my hair.  I previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect.  I'm not sure if it's this one that's defective of they just don't make them like before.
"Overheats REALLY easy :( It is light, small, cute and works ok apart from that... I would also prefer the tip &#34;thinner&#34;"
"I've been using ConAir Infiniti Pro for over 10 years, still works perfectly fine. Recently, I decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom, and bought Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler. This new unit died on Day 1, I returned it and bought a new Conair Infiniti Pro again.<br /><br />Reminds me of the saying: Buy expensive, cry once. Buy cheap, cry every day"
"I reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews. I didn't really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less.  The good things: quiet and not too heavy.  The bad: the heat from the hairdryer is too hot.  I've been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning.  And, despite the technology it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.  One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair.  I do not so I'm always drying right around my scalp. Maybe if you have long hair, this might be good for you but other than the quietness, I don't see how this is worth spending so much money on."
I've had 3 of these hair druers and was happy with them because of the folding feature. The last one I purchased through Amazon stopped heating correctly within 2 weeks of use. Thats just poor....
I agree with another reviewer who noted how big and heavy this dryer was.  I didn't even take it out of the package; ended up returning it on my own dime.
"After about a year this hair dryer started making a buzzing sound.  When I disassembled it, I could see that the blades were breaking allowing the blades to rub against the housing causing the buzzing sound.  Had I not seen this, the blades would have eventually broken off and fired out at the user.  There has been no recall so all the products are suspect.  Do not buy this product."
"i used the roller on a facail scar i have that i cover with makeup, it is not deep but im very self conscious of it. i used the roller on it as instrusted but found that it actually made the area rolled more scar like (red and leathery) i would not advise using this on scars."
"I was very happy with it for the first 5 months, but was shocked this morning when it made a loud bang and tripped the circuit breaker.  I have never had a hair dryer break in this short amount of time.  Buyer beware.  I can't return it, but I'll write Remington and let them know what I think of their product."
"Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues."
The cool air button doesn't work at all.<br />Other buttons are all right but I am not satisfied with the product.
"Hairdryer is not as quiet as claimed, easy to handle, buttons seem to be in the wrong place, since I continually turn dryer off accidentally while attempting to dry hair.  Drying capabilities are good, I would give the item no more than a C-- have definitely had better hairdryers.  Will most likely purchase another-- much quieter one and keep this as a back up!<br />Not recommended if someone is concerned about noise levels."
"BUYER BEWARE!!! This hair dryer has four settings - Off, Low (no heat), Scorch and Torch, a most disappointing purchase from Hot Tools.  There is a positive, the bonnet is much better than one from a prior Hot Tools purchase. Hoping for a short life span for this hair dryer, so that I can buy another brand."
only one speed HOT Burnt my ends Had to get rid of it
Bought 2 of these hair dryers. The first one lasted a year then the fan blades started to crack and then the blades would rub on the housing. Thinking it was because I dropped it and cracked the fan blades i bought another. This one lasted 3 months same thing. I will never buy conair again!
"We purchased this item January 3, 2011 for my daughter's bathroom. We installed it the following week. She uses a hairdryer infrequently, about once or twice a week.  She informed us tonight that the nightlight stopped working last week and when she uses the hairdryer it smells like plastic melting. Sure enough, I just checked it out. No nightlight -- plastic burning smell when turned on. Our return period window for Amazon is now expired. I just wrote Andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response. I will update what (if anything) customer service does about this situation. Until then, I am giving this item one star."
"After only using it once I noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten.  I am returning it because I can only imagine what it's going to look like after daily use for only a month.  I noticed another reviewer wrote s/he is looking for replacement attachments.  I'd rather just buy a better quality product to start with.  Also, the power of this hairdryer doesn't even match my cheaper Conair dryer that I bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer."
I purchased this dryer in July of 2005.  On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot.  I used this once a day almost every day.  I will not be buying another Jerdon hair dryer.
"We have owned two of these hair dryers and each of them functioned for just over a year (coincidentally, a few months past the return window).  We loved the fact that these fit nicely on the wall, are easy to access and keep the bathroom organized.  However, both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on.  The second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it.  These hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled.  The first time it happened, we figured it was just bad luck, but not the 2nd time.  There are several other reviews for hairdryers from this company that report similar malfunctions.  We won't be buying a 3rd time and will try another wall mount brand that hopefully isn't as hazardous."
"I also ordered the Silver Bird 2000W Turbo Hair Dryer at the end of January 2012 but was sent a Black Bird 2000W Hair Dryer instead. It was obvious someone stuck the Black Bird hair dryer in a plastic bag that was sealed with regular Scotch tape and had a small label with a bar code and a description for the Silver Bird dryer.  As soon as I received it, I contacted Amazon's Customer Service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item. I was sent a link for a UPS return label, which I printed out. I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent. The gentleman who helped me out was a true pro. He researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account, which hit the next day. I would never order anything from NewVo Beauty again. Fortunately, I received excellent service from Amazon's telephone reps. Beware of NewVo Beauty. I don't believe their outstanding ratings, either."
"First one shot out sparks and died after about two years of usage, not a bad run but a frightening end.. I loved the size so had purchased a second &#34;back up&#34; soon after buying the original. Put the backup in service about six months ago and the blower on that one started sounding odd recently, Today it made a loud noise and a piece fell off inside. I'm about to shop for another brand.."
"Warning! This dryer will catch on fire! I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not! I just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair. Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly. It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone. Do not buy. I was fooled by the good reviews, maybe I received a defective product but I will not be trying again."
"If you're extremely sensitive to sound and are looking for a quiet dryer, this is not for you.  Still had to wear earplugs during use; I wasn't expecting a whisper-quiet operation for the price, but this is NOT QUIET. It still woke up someone sleeping in the next room.<br /><br />Even using the dryer as far as I could reach from my head, while using a round ceramic brush, this thing managed to tangle and damage my fine hair. I now have tons of split ends that I did not have while using (what I thought was) an inferior dryer.  The $15 cheapo dryer I picked up at a big box store worked better at about the same noise level."
"Few problems with this Dryer.<br />First: I've had this dryer before. It was great, but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working, as they do.<br />Second: The FIRST time I plugged this dryer in the low blast setting did not work (as in, no air came out). I contacted the seller and I've received no response. The dryer is not working, and I just want a different one.<br />Third: This seller is a complete scam! They send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they'll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review. Complete extortion. I can't believe Amazon works with these guys. Mind you, since they are not an authorized retailer it is very likely the manufacturer's warrantee is void. This creates a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line: buy this from a different seller."
"Malfunctioned!  Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks!"
"&#34;You get what you pay for&#34;. Don't get cheep like me, this hair dryer  is loud! Even though it is identical tech specs to its big sister the Infinity Cord-Keeper , it's the bigger that's better. The larger version acts like a muffler. Spend the extra $20 bucks. I did, the real deal is now on order."
I bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight.  It also was touted as saying it worked on dual voltage for traveling.  I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage) it got very hot and stopped working.  So disappointing. I only rated it one star because the color was nice.
I would not recommend this product as it is not well manufactured nor does it last for a good period of time. It is not a good investment of your money.
Dryer does not work good at all! The high setting is more like using the low setting No power! I have another Revlon Travel version I bought at Walmart for 12 dollars and works so much better than this. Very disappointed and waste of money. DO NOT BUY!
"I researched all the hairdryers on amazon, and this one seemed like a great product at a great price.  Unfortunately, one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it.  The cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use, so in order to use it I have to either     1) Be within 12 inches of the socket, or   2) I have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time I'm drying.      A very frustrating experience. Buyers...beware."
"This does not mount CLOSE to wall. There is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall. You can mount it with the provided bracket, or with a screw through the back. Either way there is a gap that requires caulking. Not a small gap."
"I have fine, relatively straight, long hair. I bought this hair dryer a year ago, thinking that it would last for a while. I use it every other day to dry my hair. Nothing unusual.  It worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down. It still works but I'm not sure if its still safe to use it. Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money."
"Read the other reviews...I wish I had spent more time reading them!  This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost.  While it worked, it was very nice.... though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase.  But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord.  Too bad the quality is so poor.  STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  There are too many reviews like this one."
"but i don't. the biggest thing is that it just doesn't dry. i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing, but my hair comes out about as wet as if i'd wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes (which is to say, maybe 10 percent dry--not dripping, but definitely wet and not damp). there are other things i don't like about it, such as the hose doesn't fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn't fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time. for now, i'll stick with my hard-bonnet dryer on a floor stand. doesn't allow for much mobility, but it's way more effective at actually drying."
It melted the first time I used it in Europe despite being on the right setting. Complete waste of money.
This is a replacement of the same blow dryer that I had purchased based on a recommendation from a magazine. The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months. I have had the replacement for 3 wks now and there are times the motor slows and I think it too is going to stop completely.
"I purchased a hairdryer for over $100 from this vendor in Jan 2009.  I filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to T3 as expected. Now it's October of 2011 and it is already breaking. I was sold a POS! So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.   I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this."
I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn't worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!
"This dryer blows nicely, but does not get hot enough to dry hair quickly. It takes a really long time to dry hair, and it comes up frizzy due to drying it with low heat. I waited too long to return it, so am stuck with it.Going to use it to dry my dogs hair after bathing. Be sure to return within the given time period if you find it does not get hot enough. Mine may be defective."
"This dryer is definitely lightweight like people have said.  It feels really cheap.  The one I ordered wouldn't get hot enough (certainly not as hot as most hair dryers with this wattage), and the heat would go off and back on while using it. Took forever to dry my hair.  I'm sending it back."
This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.<br />Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the years<br />It almost made it to it's second birthday. Pitiful<br />I purchased a Panasonic and a seperate wall bracket as a replacement<br />It is most likely chinese made as well but the design should long outlast generics
The picture of the product is deceptive. I bought it on Amazon and what I received was a very cheap looking product. The instructions on how to hang it on the wall is also very confusing. I am concerned about the safety of this product so I have stopped using it. Now I am left with a cheap dryer that I am never going to use. I wish I can return it back without paying a ton on shipping.
"I bought the first one and hung it on the wall in my guest bathroom.  Within two months, it went dead.  Bought a second identical one and it went dead in the same period of time with no one using it.  Too bad because I really liked the light and it worked great when it worked."
"Edit #2: Again, the Cool Shot button is stuck in the on position.  I can not believe this has happened again.  I will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough.  Save your time, money and energy by purchasing from a well known brand.<br /><br />Edit:  I received my replacement hair dryer today and I hope the cool shot button doesn't give me trouble because I really love this hair dryer! Thank you!<br /><br />This dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get. Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast. I loved it until this morning. I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up. Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up. Even if I barely touched the Cool Shot button with my finger, it would blow cold and I would again have to pry it back out. So now I am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold. Waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the warranty. It's more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball."
"This blow dryer was heavy and too hot.  At the time of purchase this product there were plenty in stock. As soon as I got mine delivered. The product page shows this product is no longer available. Anyway, I returned it and got the Babyliss one. Much happier with the other purchase."
"I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I'll have to do it with a different brand in the future. I purchased this unit 9 months ago. A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings. I sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven't heard back from them. I'm sure they'll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model? I suggest you look at other options, which is what I'm going to do now."
"I bought this hair dryer for travel to England & Ireland, along with an adapter.  The dryer was advertised as dual voltage for worldwide travel.  That was a FALSE statement.  The FIRST time we plugged it in, it Fried!!!!  It was a huge waste of money.  I will NEVER by a Conair dryer again."
"I was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms.  Bought 3 of these and very happy, works better than the more expensive ones.  Have not had any problems thus far and works great.<br /><br />Edit:  Dropped this to one star.  In a year 2 out of the 3 I have bought failed.  One sounds like a bearing failing and the other won't get hot anymore.  Basically they are cheap for a reason.  One that failed, even thought a year old, was only used maybe 10 times."
"I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, & I have only used it 3 times. Its also cumbersome & heavy & too large  & the warm setting is far too hot... its like hot.  I am not a happy customer..."
brush too soft. gave it away.
The voltage switch was broken...could not use it on my trip oversees.  Would not refund me because too much time had passed. Big rip off
Has no power like my old one.. Would not purchase again.
"Brush too soft. The hair dryer too bulky. I would like to return it. I do not know how. Please, respond."
"I used one of these for 6 years & it worked well. So when the first one died, I bought another. But after 6 months of normal use it died and I now need a third one. Will try a different brand this time!"
"It was really loud, unnecessarily powerful for drying hair, my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking!"
The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty. You get what you pay for I guess.
I was really looking forward to this. Got it in the mail. Plugged it in and it did not work. I am sending it back.
Item came missing the connecting screw. Still waiting for someone to get back to me. One more business day and I'm going to request a refund and return.
"This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife's old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!"
"I bought my first T3 for the weight, noise, and ionic benefits.  I had a T3 for years and loved the performance.  However the construction was shabby from day one. The nozzle would not stay in place. I ended up taping it on.  When it finally died, I replaced it with another T3 thinking the first one was a lemon. This last one also disappointed.  The first time I tried to replace the concentrator, it bent the dryer!<br /><br />Plus this one seemed to leave my hair fuzzy - NO benefits from ionic ceramic claims.  This one is in a drawer and I use the Revlon I bought for 1/3 the price."
"This hair dryer is defective and dangerous. The hair dryer did not work on the low setting, the fan did not spin. I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire. The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don't think it would last very long if it did work at all."
"I loved this dryer for its small, compact size and remarkably fast drying speeding.. so much so that I bought one after the other, after the other, when my first one burned out. I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its turbo power, sparked and ultimately fried. I guess you get what you pay for and I'm not ready to shell out for Andis turbo #4, despite my previous love affair."
"It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it's not like I'm trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall). It's been almost 2 years since I purchased this and there is ZERO coil left in the cord. It's like an extension cord is now hanging from my wall. This shouldn't have happened so soon in my opinion."
"I bought this dryer at Amazon in order to get it for $125 less than the MSR.  In 6 months it quit working completely and I contacted Amazon about it only to be told that it was past the 30 days.  I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  This is when I learned that these hair dryers are ONLY sold through authorized dealers and Amazon is not one of them.  So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty and I just lost that $175.  The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  Please be aware that you're taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail, and, if it does, you will have just lost a lot of money because there is no support for it."
"We were traveling and used one of these wall mounted hair driers at a hotel. We loved how the product worked so, once home, we purchased one.    Well, the product switch failed in the first 4 months and we contacted the manufacturer. They were nice enough and had us ship it back and sent us a warranty replacement right away. The replacement lasted about the same amount of time, and has the same failure, the switch went bad.     For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.    Stay away from this item, seems like they have a design flaw in it. Two with the same switch failure in the same amount of time?"
"I made a huge mistake by not returning this hair dryer immediately.  The reviews were all terrific, so I just assumed I was not adjusting the ion settings correctly.  My hair is somewhat curly and I usually blow it straight, although sometimes I diffuse it curly.  This hair dryer has, without exception, left my hair extremely unruly.  It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn't seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.  One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.  I've been trying to contact the seller, but have been unsuccessful.  I'd love to know if there is some trick that I haven't discovered!"
"It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch but it' s a pretty decent hair drier for the price. One thing i didn't like is that the concentrator can only be put one one way (like in the pic) because the opening is oval rather than round, i had a feeling it was oval as the picture wasn't too clear. I like holding the hair dryer in a different way but with the concentrator being oval i can not adjust it to my needs.    Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it. I disposed it right away. Not safe! Be careful."
"If you value your hearing do not buy this item.  It was so loud that the first time I used it, it was unbearable.  I was excited to have a wall mount dryer, but not worth it at the extreme noise it makes.  I put it into my yard sale box and sold it."
"Three Conair dryers.  First one went on fire during use.  Second one didn't make it a year before the button broke off to retract the cord.  E-mailed Conair and they responded with lengthy instructions on how I can fix it.  Instead, I threw it away and bought the 260PX.  Although it worked well, it stopped working after 13 months.  I contacted Conair and was given instructions on how to get a new one under the limited warranty.  With the cost of shipping both ways, it would cost me the same to buy a new dryer.  So that's what I'm doing...just not from Conair.  Will never buy another Conair product!!"
"The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn't last long.  Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact.  If they make one with a decent bonnet, I'm there but this lasted about 6 uses and the bonnet broke off."
"Not hot enough or powerful enough to dry, or style, my fine hair."
I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage. I then bought this $16.99 model from Amazon that was received DOA. My replacement dryer from Amazon lasted only one week till it went pop and smoked in my hand! Amazon won't send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don't know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).
"Works okay, but very heavy!"
you get what you pay for. It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it's worth it it
"I ordered two.  The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker.  I didn't even try to plug in the second one.  It had features that I liked so I was sorry that it didn't work out."
"Please do not waste your money like I did. It lasted me exactly  3 minutes. First it heated up and turned off automatically within a minute or so. I restarted it, but it immediately turned off again and this time for good. I tried to return it for a refund, but the status kept reading : we are waiting for your return or something similar. It is not the end of the world, but I certainly am a very unhappy customer."
"ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH......while I've used Yellow Bird Hair Dryers for years and have always loved them, their high quality has totally deteriorated.  The last two hair dryers have worked less than 2 months.  The first time it happened, I decided to give them a 2nd chance.  Now, this hair dryers has quit heating after only one month of use.<br /><br />Returning the item is expensive and time consuming......I'll just have to find another company and hair dryer.  Surely, there are others that will work for longer than 1-2 months."
"The plug broke after one month.  Now I have to fiddle with the plug in the outlet to get it to come on, then it keeps turning off.  An electrician checked the electrical circuit, which is OK. It is definitely the plug on the hair dryer.  If I move it around in the outlet, the hair dryer will turn on and off and on...  It was a Christmas present I bought it early December, so now the return policy just ran out (missed it by a few days).<br /><br />Do NOT buy this hair dryer!!!!  Cheap piece of junk."
"When I first purchased this product in March of 2009 I loved it.  Less than 90 days later the item made a popping sound and now only works on the high setting.   There are several similar comments about this product only working for a short period of time, or the product starting to spark.  Buyer beware.   This item is probably not safe."
"Basic hairdryer that folds.  It doesn't seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn't fun! Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last one<br />UPDATE<br />Don't bother buying this brand.  We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  I wish someone made something that lasted longer than 6 months! I know it wasn't much money, but they shouldn't build them to fail in such a short time!"
"I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  I called our electrician to see if the outlet was having a problem which it was not.  While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    Be careful..."
I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working.  This is my second T3 hairdryer.  My first one lasted two years.  It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.
"Item as advertised claims it comes with a 'concentrator', which is why I chose this particular dryer.  It did not come with the concentrator.  It's going back."
This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount.  Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.
"I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use.  From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak.  After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.    Do not buy this model."
"I ordered this product because I heard from a number of friend how great it was. I have curly hair so I also ordered the diffuser to match it. I used it once to dry my hair, it was okay (not as I was told it would be). I then tried my diffuser, I used it 2 times. I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />My mistake was to not read the reviews. I am writing this to save people money, don't do it! I believe the blow dryer I got is a knock-off and I would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted."
"This hair dryer is impossible to turn on. The switch is flat and very hard to move. Additionally this small thing is very noisy. It is really a shame because the hairdryer looks very cute. I bought a Conair instead, also 1600W but it is really quiet and with an easy to push switch. It does not look as elegant as Andis, but it works so much better and I think it is also a little lighter."
"****UPDATE 2nd order****<br />As below, I ordered a second replacement.  We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it's almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process.  Overall a nice compact good looking unit."
"I know this is supposed to be the best hair dryer ever, but it's not. Maybe I got a lemon, but mine has never worked very well. It takes FOREVER to dry my hair. And yes, I do clean the filter regularly. When friends stay over and borrow it, they always comment on how horrible it is. I look forward to traveling so I can use those crappy little hotel hair dryers attached to the wall, because they work better than this one. I don't normally write negative reviews, but I can't recommend strongly enough NOT to buy this product. Do yourself a favor and spend $20 on a ConAir model, and you will be much much happier. Don't fall for the hype like I did!"
"I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &#34;blew up&#34;.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don't want to deal with.<br /><br />If we get it replaced, I'll change my rating"
"I was in the market for a diffuser, and I never bought one before... I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy. I'll stick with a regular hair dryer with a diffuser on the end.<br /><br />The heat in this isn't as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot. I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn't hot enough. Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high. I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion. The circular motion blew all of my curls out (think if it like a fan you use to cool your house), and I don't have that happen on my regular blow dryer. I will say, that my natural curls are not very tight, and my goal when diffusing my hair is to help maintain my curls with a low heat... This did not cut it at all.. Not hot enough, and the way that the air circulated blew my curls out. I'm not sure if it is just this product or if it includes other diffusers like this as well... but I am sticking to my normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment!"
"I ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture. Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store. :/"
Received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4-6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday....if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you. It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart. Glad I never mounted it.
I originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly.  I would re-done the review sooner but didn't think of it.  Don't waste your money!!!!
"This is the second Revlon hair dryer I've purchased in the last four years and both times it had the same problem -- overheating where the cord enters the handle.  This one lasted a month. The previous one -- a forty dollar item -- lasted two months and almost caused a fire while I was using it. I do not recommend Revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again.  -----  Added on Oct 13, 2011:  Well, once it started showing overheating problems that I recognized from previous Revlon dryer, I went ahead and ordered an Andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer. My previous Andis worked for several years with no problem and I loved it before it conked out on me and I would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time, so I ordered the Revlon instead. Sigh. So, one month later I am tossing the Revlon and fortunately the Andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my Revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening. So I had a back up in place. Thank you Andis! I will not be buying anything but Andis hair dryers from now on. The Revlon is not worth buying IMO."
"Absolutely loved it.  Until it quit working.  After six weeks the &#34;low&#34; setting was just a slight puff of wind.  The &#34;high&#34; setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  At the same time, the &#34;hot&#34; setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  So I started using the &#34;warm&#34; setting.  It's now completely worthless."
"This dryer was purchased last summer and safely stored while we moved. I pulled it out this January, and the low setting has already stopped working, while the high setting barely pushes out any air.  I'm now convinced this was a fake, and am sorely disappointed. Amazon is always our first stop for purchases such as these, and I've always been very happy with their customer service... I have a request for a refund in, and we'll see how this resolves."
Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!
DO NOT BUY! Lasted 1 Week!- Gets Hot and Quits in less then 3 minutes- needs to cool off then will work for another 3 minutes!<br />Aggravating and not worth  the time to order this product.
"When I bought this, a real SP62 was shown in the picture. What I received is the one now shown in a replacement picture. It is narrower, with several fewer blades than a real SP62 and does not function nearly as well. Don't wast your money on this piece of junk, it makes the shaver not worth using."
I bought this hair dryer in March based on Amazon reviews. It worked ok at the  beginning but now no longer has any air pressure and takes at least 2x as long to dry my hair. The return period for this product is one month and now I need to purchase another new hair dryer. Very displeased with this purchase.
"2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air. It also is much heavier than most hairdryers, and, when it was working,  I really didn't notice a big difference between this hairdryer and regular(non-ionic), less expensive dryers."
These seem to work up until a couple of months after warrantee expires in one year. .am ordering my third so I don't have to fix the holes in my tile wall for a new backplate that may not cover it.
"This worked great, while it worked. I only had it four months before it stopped working. The two speeds became one which was slower than the low setting. Of course, I was past the date to return or exchange, so I am back to buying a new one. Not worth it, unless you  only need a hairdryer for 4 months."
Had it for only a few months and it already is losing it's heating element. Also the dial to change the heat doesn't work. The attachments are flimsy and get stuck easily. I can't wait for it to completely break so I can buy one that works properly. I wish I read all of the reviews for this product. Never again will I make that mistake.
"I bought this hair drier for my girlfriend 3 months ago, expecting it to be great. The attachments do not attach to the drier! It is now useless to her and too late to exchange the product."
Didn't last 5 months. Cheaply made and the motor burned up in no time at all. Don't waste your money.
"This is a basic somewhat compact blow dryer that worked well in the beginning. As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk."
I purchased this hairdryer back in November of 2012. Fastforward to June of 2013 and someone was using the hairdryer while looking in the mirror and it BURST INTO FLAMES!  Luckily the person threw it down and put out the fire but last time I checked hairdryers don't normally do this.
"Purchased this product at the end of March as a result of positive reviews. It periodically shut off until finally this week it stopped working completely. After only 4 months, a hair dryer should not stop working. Definitely would not recommend."
This hair dryer was a waste of money.<br /><br />The cord is far too short for proper styling unless you are standing within 2 feet of power socket.<br /><br />The warm setting is cool<br /><br />On the hot setting Only the inner part of the dryer blows hot hair and the outer rim is cool air which makes the hot setting basically a warm.<br /><br />Very disappointed- I would pay 15-20 for this as my local CVS.
"It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc. After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell. I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element. My other dryers lasted much longer than this one. I'm not buying this model ever again."
Did not like this at all. My hair took longer to dry and it was so loud!!! Returned immediately
"John Frieda JF 1 Full Volume Hair Dryer works has major flaws and I do not recommend it. The first and most major problem is that the on/off power levels are right where your hands go, so it is constantly changing power levels. The only way around that is to hold it awkwardly. It is also very heavy and loud. Finally, I use the diffuser attachment and it constantly falls off. Today a chink of the diffuser fell off and broke. Into the garbage. I a, going to buy a new blow dryer and this junk will be thrown out."
"I have always bought Conair products in the past, so I never expected this purchase to be problematic.  The dryer works fine, but none of the attachments fit tightly and they fall off with the slightest touch.  It's a huge design error and frustrating as can be.  I would never recommend this product."
"This thing is way to small to be useful. If it were a portable, perhaps, but this is a wall mount! It's like a mini hand dryer. Returned it immediately after receiving it."
"This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.<br /><br />I tried taking it apart to see if I could simply try removing whatever piece had gotten caught in the motor/fan to no avail.<br /><br />Thus, had to trash it.<br /><br />I recommend getting a nicer hairdryer...something in the $30 - $40 range which will last a long time.  This was crap and I should have known better :)"
"The description of this item is not accurate. It doesn't specify that it won't fit most of the tubs. When I got it I saw that my tub is too high for it, but it was too late - they don't allow a return even if bench wasn't unpacked. Waste of money."
This hair dryer doesn't function well after I used it for a month. It just suddenly became so hot and the wind was not as strong as before. Also it is a little bit heavy.
"This has hardly any power.. there is another product Pro Beauty Tools Pbdr5886 Professional Travel Hair Dryer, White and Black  which is far cheaper at $25 and 1800 watts, ionic and dual voltage. I dont know why people complain about size of T3. Honestly you can get a smaller lighter dryer which are even more rubbish but light?!, you cant expect power from a smaller motor. I was actually looking for a full size hair dryer which is dual voltage. I dont care about weight so much as performance. Cant seem to find one :( But this is waste of money. By the way to note there is only ONE button for heat and fan. So only TWO settings, the description is misleading. You have low fan and high fan. That's it. There is no adjustment for heat level despite what the description says."
"Ordered it for my wife, but the bonnet was too small so she had to return it. The alternate brand worked fine."
The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and the hot almost burnt my hair. Make a light weight product Remington!!!
Lightweight entry into the blowdryer category doesn't have enough oomph to blow even the finest hair dry. Low air pressure and low heat combine to make a lengthy process out of what ought to be a quick morning ritual.
The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes.  Not like toasty warm - HOT!    It is heavy and the buttons are located in a bad spot.  Don't bother.
"This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn't able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn't use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product."
The concept seemed perfect - combing and drying your hair at the same time.  The problem is that it simply does not dry my hair.  Not even at the highest setting.  Very disappointing.
It worked great for about 8 months both on 110 and 220v. Unfortunately it's started making a weird buzzing sound after about 8 months and smells like burning. Dang.
"I made the mistake of trusting that the picture on this product page was actually a picture of what I would get.  It clearly says that it is SLS-Free Fluoride toothpaste.  The toothpaste I received is SLS-free, but does not have fluoride.  I'm in the process of returning it."
It is too loud.  I googled quiet hair dryers and it came up.
"I used an Andis 1875 hair dryer in a hotel and loved it but when I ordered it online, I got a different product.  The product I got is an Andis 1875 but it isn't the same.  I'm disappointed in the one I got because it's not as powerful as the one at the hotel."
"DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER.  I have very thick, strong, long hair, and this dryer BURNED OFF MY HAIR.  It is way too powerful and gets way way way too hot. I now have a giant chuck out my hair on one side. It also burned the plastic tips of my round brush. Disaster."
"I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews so no one can just say, The product sucks!  But that is somewhat appropriate.  It is also true about the manufacturer's return policy.  I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one. I hadn't planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn't have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?"
"My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly."
"The hair dryer worked very well, until the cool shot button got stuck and now there is only cold air emitted. Next, the hair dryer kept tripping the circuit  and blowing the circuit. It's a shame since the dryer was quick. Don't buy this unless you want to replace your hair dryer in a couple of months."
"Save your money, this dryer is cheap and rightfully so.  The blower is not very powerful and the new method of covering the small filter on the back of the fan is a small hinged door that keeps popping open.  I removed the small filter thinking it would then stay shut and it still pops open.  I have used Conair for years and always been happy, but this one is a piece of... ah Junk."
"I had the same problem as other reviews. After the first use, the dryer stopped blowing hot air. Such a disappointment. Especially since the one time I used it, it did an amazing job."
"The raving reviews about this hair dryer are all correct: it dries hair faster! its sound isn't as obnoxious as others! it's small! compact! cute! However, it only lasted about 10 months. We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old's hair. Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting. The cool air button was great, too, but we rarely used it. It died suddenly, with no warning sign, after about 9-10 months. DISAPPOINTED!"
"I was trying to replace a hair dryer that had provided faithful performance for many years, and was also quiet. This particular hair dryer seemed like it would fit the bill. It did not. Did not even use it for a whole session. The main problem was that the plug would not stay in the outlet. Any small movement, which is required for drying hair, and the plug would fall out of the outlet. Have never had a problem with the other dryer, or dryers of guests. The other disappointment was how loud it is. I wish that I could find a clone of my old dryer!"
"I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  I tried using several outlets in our house and got no action.  My last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing.  This is very disappointing."
"The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on low/cool.  It is uncomfortable to use it.  I am not sure what my next step is going to be, but I cannot recommend   this product."
"First, it's red and not blue. Second, it's large, very heavy and loud. Third, after 3 months' use, it died on me. Vendor offers no return/replacement after 30 days."
My old blow dryer broke and I needed a quick replacement.  The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  The hair dryer is flimsy and the nozzle continues to fall off from day one.  I never had the time to pack it up and send it back. Bad me for not returning it.
My old one had less watts and was much better than the new one. The old dried my hair in half the time it takes now.
"This hairdryer has a serious design flaw. There is no &#34;guard&#34; preventing hair from being pulled into the fan and ripped from the scalp. It is especially hazardous to those who have fine hair that tends to have flyaways. I should have returned it immediately but I decided to continue using it with caution. Mistake! This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out! Needless to say, I am quite unhappy about it. I will be contacting the manufacturer."
"I've had this dryer for only 8 months and the high speed setting no longer works. I would have rated this very highly had it continued to function properly, but for the cost of this dryer, lasting less than a year is completely unacceptable."
"Don't waste your money, I was two inches away from a girl and nothing. I'm in college and even in class it did nothing, and I put it on right before class."
"I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn't the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It's overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all."
Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don't waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.
"Too powerful on high. Not powerful enough on other settings. Needs a additional setting. Extra features (nano technology, ion, etc.) do nothing to change the look or health of my hair. The diffuser doesn't make my hair curly/wavy. (but the one on my old hair dryer did.) Going to try and return."
You can't use this dryer without a net or curlers. Will not dry natural hair styles because it sucks air from the bottom through the top and if your hair isn't kept down the fan will suck it upwards? And yes the dingger is loud.
"I paid an extra twenty five dollars to have the hair dryer shipped a.s.a.p. as I needed it right away. It arrive wrapped in a Priority envelope in the thin box that the hair dryer came in.  I don't know if it was damaged in shipping from poor packaging or if it was damaged before, but it makes an elecricl element noise each time it is turned on and off. It also gets too hot, so I suspect it might have had the thermostat damaged.  The T3 Featherweight Luxe hair dryer is awesome and makes your hair feel much healthier. I am disappointed in this particular one and the way that it was shipped."
"I just opened up my package which I was very excited about because of the reviews I read. Well, once I opened it I found someone's hair all in the box and sticking to the plug stickers on the hair dryer. Also, there were scratches and dings all over the hair dryer. This was 100% used. I am totally grossed out that someone else's hair was all over a product that I paid good money for. When someone returns something it is not right to resell it so someone else. UPS is coming to pick it back up tomorrow and I am assuming I'll be getting a refund or at least I better. I am extremely disappointed and have never had this happen before using Amazon. Either way, I will not be buying from this seller anymore!"
Boughtt in July 2013....now the hot setting goes from hot to cold all while in the HOT setting.....
"I was dismayed when my Andis Hang-Up died because I had screwed it to the wall and I didn't want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon. The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle. The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire. I sent it back to Amazon who promptly replaced it. The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one. I'm still using it and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard."
Did not like it at all. It gets way too hot and the piece does not stay on. Save your money and buy a better one. There are no heat settings so you are stuck with the hot one that eventually will dry out your hair. I had to return it :(
"I gave it one star because there are none lower.  It did not work in Israel even though we had top of the line converters.  In America, it was wimpy and hard to hold.  The voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist.  Find another one."
"The biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This drier has to be a fake t3 because I've used a t3 for many years and loved it. This drier however gets hot enough, but there's absolutely no power behind it to blow dry the hair. Essentially it's just barely blowing while heating up my hair. My hair takes forever to dry with this thing and after its finally dry it's a frizzy mess. This company seems dishonest as well because in the box there was a large piece of paper stating that they'll give a lifetime warranty if I give a good review! So they're not standing by their product but instead they're essentially trying to pay me to lie! I'm sorry, but I have to be honest and the drier is a piece of junk."
"Beware if your dryer has a wide and/or short barrel. Won't fit. There should be a way to find this out before actual purchase, but information on fit is a bit vague."
Too big and heavy.  Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful.
"I like the hair dryer itself, while it was working.  Mine lasted 4 months and completely died.  Now I have to figure out how to return it, because it says I am past my return period on Amazon and can't return it here.  Would not do this again because it is too much of a hassle!"
lasted for a few months and then crapped out would not be worth buying again only used it 4-5 times a month.
"It's too loud, so i didn't used it a lot,(like aroud seven times)the last time i used it, it stop working suddenly and it smells like something just burned, already is in the dumpster."
"I bought this and it broke the second time I used it!  I do not use my blow dryer often, so when I finally used it again the second time, it made a very loud noise and then would not power on again"
This hair dryer is a waste of money!  Purchase a Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler - $34.99  OR  Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer - $39.99  Works better and saves you a heap of money.  This dryer is NOT worth $139.99!!!
"Even though I paid more for this dryer than others I've owned, it died suddenly after just 10 months even though I only used it 2-3 times/week. When it did work, the long cord got terribly tangled and was a pain, so be sure you want that if you buy this. But my advice is to buy a different brand. I've bought many brands of hair dryers over the years and never had one die after less than 2 years use! Theoretically this was still under warranty, but it didn't seem worth the hassle to replace it (esp as I didn't want another one) so I chalked it up to experience and bought a Conair for less $."
Said it had three speeds but it really only had two.  Temperature was either too hot or not hot enough.
We have had this model on our wall for years.  Then we started buying them from Amazon vice other catalogs/sources.  Two in two years.  Current one purchased July 2006 and broke Nov 2006.  These have faulty switches that melt and/or deform.  WARRANTY?????  First one from Amazon did last 18 months or so.
"BROKE 2 DAYS AFTER 30 DAYS SO I CAN'T RETURN OR EXCHANGE (ON AMAZON) FOR A NEW ONE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!<br />I did like the dryer while it lasted, LOVED THE COLOR, however to pay money for something to work for less than 30 days, it was shipped so I lost a few days there, is a joke.  This might be the best dryer, per stars and rating on Amazon, but for the money, go to the local CVS or Rite Aid where you can take it back and exchange the product when it breaks.  Oh well, sorry AMAZON PRIME you get &#34;0 STARS&#34; for this one too... sad because I buy almost everything with Prime."
"Comb breaks easily, a little hard to old without touching all the buttons."
This product had been used and packaged up. The dryer does not get hot and the low speed is not very low. I will be returning the item. I liked the weight but the controls rub my hand badly
The first two times I used this dryer was ok. Now every time I use it the motors sounds like it is bumpi g something and about to. Low up. I was so excited to get this dryer but instead I am very disappointed.
The bristles on the brush are too flimsy to straighten very curly hair. plus this drier does not get hot enough or have enough air flow..it took forever to dry my hair and i was left with a frizzy mess.
"I'm one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about.  It's just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I'm leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug."
Don't let the cheap price draw you in. This hair dryer is not worth it. I tossed my still working hair dryer that I had owned for 8 years when I bought this. 6 months later it caught on fire. Yes caught on fire on the inside was a bright blue flame and a burning smell. Frightening! Do not buy!
"I purchased this product March 27. It is June 15. The comb attachment started losing teeth after the 3 use. The attachment now has a crack in it. Very upset. The whole reason I purchased this dryer was because of the comb attachment. I am going to try to contact the seller to see if they will replace it. It's too late to return. Also, it's actually melting."
The cord does not retract. I've bought this blue dryer for years in the store and the first one I buy online doesn't work the same. Pretty disappointing since the retractable cord is the reason I buy it in the first place.
junk... the diffuser does not fit on the dryer. My whole reason for purchasing this item!
"I bought this product because I had a lot of tattoos and didn't want to fade them, however once I got it in the mail and used it for the first few times the pump did not work and it took forever to get the lotion out of the bottle."
When I touched the box I knew right then and there that something doesn't feel right. It didn't feel like a brand new box and when I opened it up my suspicion was confirmed. I have received a used or return product when I paid for a new one. The hair dryer had marks on it from previous use. I'm not happy about this.  UPDATE: I decided to use it anyways but it wouldn't even work. I tried resetting and testing it but it won't even turn on. The buttons are very cheaply made. When I moved the buttons it felt like it would fall apart. Very disappointed.
I had to send this product back because the heat holes in the dryer head are to high to dry the back and sides of my head.
"First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.    Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..      Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.    Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!    Please don't buy, it's fake."
"My wife LOVED this hairdryer so much that she bought another when the first one sparked and died after several months.  Unfortunately, several months later, that one sparked and died.  Very disappointed!"
I have purchased two of these units.  First one lasted a year before burning out.  Thought it was the way my wife was using it that was the problem so I purchase another one and it now it is an expensive night light.  It shuts off when using and she cannot completely dry her hair.
Has no power.  Thought I would spend more and get a dryer that was better but it was not worth it.<br />Makes a horrible whine sound when I use it and takes a long time to dry my hair.
"I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  But forget it now.  Now I changed my review. That 4 year warranty a joke, especially when Onei company won't contact me back after weeks of waiting.  I bought my hair dryer from the MKT Distribution off Amazon.  Good follow-up from this company but I received a bad unit.  I bought my hair dryer August 2013 and it broke down 3 weeks ago.  While I was blow drying my hair all of a sudden the power went down to a 1/3 of what it was.  As if the life was sucked out of it.  It can't even dry my hair now.  It's like a humming useless object.  Nice to know I wasted 90.00."
"I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  Thank you, Mix Wholesale, for wasting my time."
"Started making strange noises and burnt out just a few months after purchase (we bought it in April, it's now September). Pro Beauty Tools offers an exchange but you have to pay to ship the damaged item to them AND pay a return shipping & handling fee. And from the other reviews here I expect another one would likely just burn out again in a few months... would have been nice otherwise."
I was excited about the hair dryer and used it less than two weeks and the high speed just quit. High speed is what I use to dry my hair so now the dryer is useless to me. I have never had this happen. I purchased the hair dryer because it came highly rated.
Purchase this item use it once and it's already in the box to be return. My daughter have natural hair so its all it easier to come her hair when it's blow dry and this could bit do the job at all.
Hard to use. I have a $20 hair drier that works better. Don't get why it is so expensive. It  does not have a cool button
"I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams!  Not so.  I used it for about a month, trying to like it.  It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should.  It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power.  It's like my old hair dryer on low!  I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100.  Now, that dryer really BLOWS!  It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it's that fast), that's 65 years!"
Cord has unmovable stop on it. Space is limited and I needed the cord to retact into handle completely.
"DO NOT BUY! As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily. I would definitely not buy this again.<br /><br />and<br /><br /> I would look for another brand."
VERY Heavy. On/Off switch right on handle and gets turned off during use all the time.
"Buttons on the dryer are not user friendly, if you are planning to use often its not a good buy."
"If I could give this product a negative I would.  Bought my first one with a gift card and loved at it at first, it great power and heat.  It lasted about 6 months before it started cutting out. I contacted the seller, but I was beyond what they would cover.  Then I contacted the distributor who said &#34;no problem, send back the defective product and we will replace it.&#34;  Neat, sent it back at my cost :(.  Receive the replacement pretty quickly, yay!  Sadly about 6 months later I had the same issue with the new one cutting out, no power.  Not sure it is worth contacting the distributor again so I can pay to send it back for a new replacement that might last another 6 month. DONE."
"This hair dryer blows so much smoke, it has to be unhealthy for my hair. When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer. After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage but the other selling points may not be true. I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one. I do not recommend this product and wish I didn't waste my money in such a poor quality tool."
I know you get what you pay for but this was ridiculous.  I liked the retractable cord and the folding handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  This morning my second one was completely dead.  And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  It doesn't get much worse.  I'm not rough with it and each lasted less than a year.<br />This thing is simply not reliable.  I shouldn't have tried it twice.<br />Do not recommend.
"This dryer costs and weighs twice as much as my good old Conair dryer that lasted me 15 years, but works no better. I wish I bought something else. It is bulky, heavy and slow. Not sure why does the maker claim that the hair becomes shiny and silky because of their dryer. Mine did not get better a single bit.<br /><br />Update 5 months later: it slowed down substantially after 5 months in service."
"I tried it once and it came on with full power and then about 2 minutes in, the drying power was cut in half. There was nothing I could do to get it to come back on with full power. The highest setting was now merely a trickle of air. No idea what happened, but not going to buy it again."
"While using it one day it all of a sudden sounded like it went on low, but it just lost its oomph and it never came back.  The next time I turned it on it ran for a few seconds then stopped working at all.  It had hardly been used, but I had it long enough that I couldn't return it.  Bummer.  I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  I hadn't even gotten around to hanging it yet."
I work in a high end salon. I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.
"DON'T BUY THIS HAIR DRYER!!!!!  Buy $11 worth of lottery tickets, donate the $11 to charity, buy ice cream, anything else.... just don't waste your money on this junk!!!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I LOVED this little dryer for 6 weeks (just after the return period ended), now i have to throw it in the garbage!  The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.  Conair doesn't have to worry that anyone would be stupid enough to take them up on their warranty (and flushanother $20 down the toilet) and Amazon, must figure that most of the dryers will work long enough that it isn't their problem!"
"After using this hair dryer for six months I finally got so fed up with it that I broke down and got myself a BaByliss. With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it`s so heavy I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it`s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer. That one was at least quick. I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry. I don`t even want to imagine that with long hair! In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else. Only when I recently visited my parents and used my mom`s hair dryer I realized that the cause for my chaotic mop was this hair dryer.<br />Oh, and Conair donates only ONE dollar from the sale of each hair dryer."
Purchased 5/2014. Dead as of 12/2014. Perfectly competent (nothing &#34;ionically&#34; special) while working. We've gotten 4-5 years at the very least out of past blow dryers. You make the decision.
"This product was very dry, it seemed old and really did not work at all, I do not recommend, waste of money"
"in less than 2 years with minimal usage by just one person, this blow dryer no longer works.  Only blow cold air.  What a rip off, i have another professional dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong.  DO not buy this one."
"I purchased this dryer in September of 2012. It is now April 2013 and the dryer is on its last legs. It still runs, but it powers down to a lower setting while trying to use the high setting. I expect it to quit all together soon."
"I would have given this product five stars at this time yesterday. Unfortunately, yesterday I heard a popping sound while using it, and it completely stopped working. Totally unacceptable."
I have been using this conditioner for years including a few bottles I've purchased from Amazon and directly from Bumble and Bumble. The last bottle I got from amazon smelled like nail polish and burned my skin. Clearly a counterfeit version has ended up in their supply chain.
3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it. It was used twice a day. Do not recommend it. go use your money for something more durable. Oh and also big plates do not fit in it.
the microwave turntable and light would come by itself and sometimes when you closed the door.  At first we were able to cook with the microwave but eventually it got to where I couldn't get it to cook no matter what we tried such as unplugging it and it would sit there rotating but not heating.  So sadly we had to send it back.  I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun.
Came in brand new package but item doesn't work at all.
"It came slightly damaged but main problem is that it does not heat at all in any functions.  I have tried to heat a cup of water with Microwave Express, it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room temperature after 30 seconds.  Then I have tried all the functions and none of them work.  The surface light and the vent fan works fine.  I really should try it before I install it.  Now I have all the trouble to remove it and install another one.<br /><br />I order it from Amazon and contacted both the seller Home Care Company.  Since it is Saturday so I will have to wait up to two working days to to get a respond from Home Care Company.  I am not sure what will happen but I am not recommend to buy this product or buy it online."
I received the microwave and it didn't even work. I didn't have the original packaging so they wouldn't refund me. Brilliant. lol
"I purchased this microwave in January of 2015. In July of 2015 the microwave completely stop working. The whole microwave stop working the clock, everything. I want to get my money back. Most microwaves last for years. I have had a microwave that lasted for 25 years. To have a microwave last for only 6 months is disappointing."
"The oven  stopped working  1 month after I got it, Samsung is unhelpful, a repair guy came said he fixed it. It is still not working,<br />I have been chasing Samsung for 2 weeks."
"It was delivered on Feb. 14, 2015 and has stopped working already. Brand new outlet so I know it's not that. Will not turn on at all and the return window closed on Mar 17, 2015."
Cheaply put together.  Very low quality for the amount of money spent. Spend a little more and get a quality product.
"Love the size, but didn't last a month!"
THIS GIVES OFF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE BACK.  Simply touching the left side casually after it completed a fast heat cycle left a burn on my forearm.  I then felt around the unit without touching and found the right side cool the top reasonably so and the back burning with heat.  Since this is a countertop unit and the side will be exposed in most applications my experience is that this unit is dangerous!  Especially if you have children.  I am returning it immediately.
The only thing it did was cover the spots .  When I turned the microwave on it sparked.  I had waited 24 hours.  It is a GE mstainless on the out side.  Wasn't cheap and was a gift.  Suck it up and buy a new one.
"I bought this unit to replace an older LG model that was discontinued.  The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.  It's probably not going to be covered by warranty.  And how do I get it to the manufacturer?  They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven.  If I pay for shpping both ways, I might as well buy a new microwave.  Lessons learned:  I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose return/service policy I understand and I will not use an over-the-range microwave again."
"The cord isn't long enough, so I have to pay more money for a longer cord."
Very small. You can find better products in the store at lower prices.
"Looks good, only worked a week. First - timer would work but no heating occurred, next dy everything looked like it was good ( lit up, revolving, timer working) but food temp was not changing. Cancelled replacement and have NOT been refunded."
"I loved the price on this microwave. So did my 90 year I'll grandfather.  We bought it and he was excited to have back the way he can cook most of his meals. Sadly though, half of the button do not work. He can not set the clock or defrost... I offered to try and return it, but he needs it to cook, and it can do that I guess. But I don't recommend this product at all."
It quit working one month after the date I could return it.  I had been out of town for 6 weeks after I bought it so it was barely used.
"Can someone tell me how to make the door open more easily????????<br /><br />I bought this microwave to sit on top of refrigerator - only place I have for one but the door is so hard to open that by the time I've punched the &#34;open&#34; bar enough to get the thing open, the oven has moved back away from my reach so have to climb on stool and pull it back forward and then put food in.<br /><br /> UPDATE March 6, 2015 -  After buying the nonslip product as suggested by reply to earlier review, the nonslip sits unopened.  Instead, the microwave sits unplugged like a small dead dinosaur on top of my refrigerator.  For 70 years since my grandfather built this little house, a refrigerator has been plugged into the the receptacle behind it including for 20 years my various ones.<br /><br />It took this Danby microwave less than two months of less than stellar service to trip the breaker for the first time.  Even with the electrician installed updated breaker box, the Danby managed to screw it up.  After unplugging the Danby and waiting, I tried again to reset the breaker and it worked.  I now have a refrigerator again but have no microwave.<br /><br />To use, this microwave oven had to be almost punched to open its door.  Then adjust turntable so it would turn.  Then add some more time with the 30-second add button.  Then punch it again to open the door.  Meanwhile, from the punching, the oven has slid away from reach so get out the stepstool  Just touching a numbered button DOES NOT begin to set the time.  Instead, that starts &#34;express&#34; time of minutes for the number I touched."
"I know you get what you pay for, in most cases, but in this case, I don't feel I did. I expected it to take longer to heat than my old 1000 watt, but it takes at least twice as long. The turn table rattles, and because of it's light weight, you have to hold it with your left hand while pushing the button to open the door with your right, otherwise you will push it across the counter. Very displeased."
"The handle is attached to the door by two weak screws that bear up against a nonmetallic surface on the door. For my unit, the lower attachment door surface broke within six months and the handle pulled away from the door.<br />I am having a service call take care of it but it looks like a design flaw. Even if I get a replacement door, I expect it will break again in six months. Avoid this model design.<br />Updated Dec 2016: Yes the replacement door also is showing the same problem.<br />Worse: The magnetron failed as soon as the one year warranty was up. Would not heat food. We had a service call and replaced it.<br />It has failed again in 9 months. LG wants more for a service call than the new microwave cost.<br />I would avoid LG microwaves completely. I still have a countertop Panasonic microwave working perfectly after 15 years - unfortunately LG does not know microwaves :)"
"Microwave looked nice, but did not heat. It seemed like a fan was only blowing cold air. Amazon has great return policy, however, and it made the unfortunate buy easily reversed."
[[VIDEOID:567df035967d824cead7d2509901668b]] The unit went out after the initial warranty had expired. The unit was listed as having a 10 year warranty on the Magnetron. The Magnetron (the main engine of the microwave). I jumped thru hopes for weeks (including taking videos of the product shooting flaming sparks) with Samsung warranty service only to be told that they do not have a service agreement near Arkansas. Another week passed and I spoke with them one the phone and they we finally agreed on a partial refund and they sent me an email confirming the amount.<br /> I said fine and went and bought another microwave. They never sent the refund and I called a week later and they said that I had to provide them parts from the original microwave???.......easily done if they had told me this before.!!  They never said a word about it either on the phone or email.<br />This unit should last longer than it did. I feel stupid that I have bought a kitchen full of Samsung appliances. Now if/when these break I will have to deal with the same deceptive people and lack of support again.....Steer clear !!
Came with a huge dent in the side.
"I purchased this microwave in February, 2014. It was  perfect size but stopped working within three months.  After contact with Whirlpool via phone and email, I was told by the Whirlpool Product Review Board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where I lived to return it to.  I took it to my local metals' disposal site and provided proof of compliance to Whirlpool.  The Whirlpool Product Review Board then promised repeatedly over a three-month period that a check would be sent for the purchase price.  They apologized for the delay, at one time emailing to me that my Buy Back Check order was stuck in the system.  Then, after three months of promises, Whirlpool stopped all communication with me. More than two more months have passed since then and I still haven't received my Buy-Back check. I don't expect to get one.  Do not buy this product.  You can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon.  In my case, I lost $152.78 and spent many, many hours, time and money doing exactly what Whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty.  Whirlpool apparently does not honor it's warranties, at least not for this product.<br /><br />P.S. 10 days after this review was posted, Whirlpool issued a refund check."
"After 17 months there was a popping sound, and electrical smell and it died. We just warmed food up in it. No serious cooking. It is a great size and convenient. Is it worth the price for a year and a half of service? It lost the high setting about 6 months ago but we didn't care too much. You might want to pass on this model."
"I feel like I made a big mistake buying this online, I would find a better brand and quality, then bigger one for even less buying it local. I paid over $100 shipping and it doesn't worth it, it's small and at the beginning it didn't heat. It's more or less now but not what I expected!"
"DIFFICULT to install, even with two people, mostly the taking down of the old greasy unit. Came with a BROKEN FAN and hence no exhaust. Whirlpool sending a repairman after a week with no microwave. Will he bring the correct parts and be able to fix it?? Impossible to return as box is not a box but styrofoam and cardboard on top and bottom with shrink wrap holding it all together. If you want one of these get it at Best Buy and save $50.00.  It's now a month since we installed the unit and the fan has been replaced (part had to be ordered). Turns out we could use the microwave without the fan. All arranged thru Whirlpool with local repairman fixing it in place."
"Product just isn't built to last, when buying these types of appliances best to get something you can unplug and replace.  This product and company just do not hold up...Equipment brand new 5/27/13, installed Aug/13 stopped working 15 months later."
Appliance was the right one to match my other appliances but did not work on power up. There is not a service tech that is backed by the company seller. So it had to be sent back. My money was refunded pronto but I would rather have the applince
"We installed this microwave three months ago and it was working well until several days ago when we set the convection bake to heat at 375 degrees and after 15 minutes the device completely shutdown.  It has completely died.  I set up an evaluation and repair with GE (between 8 - 12 am) and by 11 30 am, they still hadn't showed up and I needed to leave for the office.  BTW, I had a similar experience when I scheduled a repair for my GE washer.  I will never by GE again!  After 3 months, to have problems with a brand new appliance is unacceptable."
"Never worked well, intermittently stops working - then starts again.  I would have returned this in the first WEEK, but once this monster is hung on the wall, and it's made its first bag of popcorn, who keeps the shipping box??  It finally died after the fan would not turn off, now it's completely inert.  The only bright side is it will fit in my community's GARBAGE CANS.  This unit has been a frustration since installation."
"We really enjoyed using this microwave while it lasted; however, after 2 1/2 years of use it just stopped working one day. We chose this drawer-type microwave because we wanted to &#34;hide&#34; our microwave in our island for aesthetic purposes, and for this reason, were willing to pay more for it.  If I could do it again, I would definitely have splurged for one of the more expensive drawer microwaves that are available from manufacturers other than Sharp.  Yes, Sharp makes the cheapest version of this type of microwave, but we learned the hard way that you get what you pay for."
After our GE Caf茅 microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years GE said it would cost $800 to fix.  So we purchased this advantium oven.  It shipped and would not heat up.  We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better.
Received this microwave.  The first time we tried to use it the top and the sides got extremely hot and it shut off .  It now has no power at all.  I will be returning this and not purchasing a new one.
"After using the microwave for 1 week, it stopped working.  I just sent it back and waiting for a replacement.  I will give sharp 1 more chance."
"I would not recommend buying an appliance such as a microwave through Amazon.  Upon receipt of this item I had no idea that it had concealed damage.  Two days after receipt I elected to install the unit.  I noticed that the bottom corner of the door had a nice dent, but was something that I could live with, rather then deal with the agony of a return.  After installing the unit the door would not stay closed.  After looking the door over, I noticed that the clips where broken that hold it closed.  Totally frustrated at this point.  I have received a return mailing label and MRA number, but this will cost me $50 to ship back.  The unit was not shipped in no box, just corner molding, foam end caps, and shrink wrap &#34;No Original Packaging&#34;.  When it was all said and done, I bought the identical microwave under the Kenmore label from Sears for $100 less.  Multiple emails to Amazon on the return freight with no response.  This was a headache that I really didn't need.  I have purchased numerous items from Amazon in the past with no problems. This is a product category that would be best served by a professional retailer."
"I was looking for the microwave with certain size with a basic function. I was so happy to find this product at Amazon.<br />The first one arrived last week, but I had to return it next day. It made clicking noise when I closed the door. It also make some noises when I push &#34;Start&#34; button.<br />The second one, I received today and connect, set up clock, and start with a cup of water to make sure it works.  I felt bad returning the same product twice.<br />This time, I called Whirlpool customer service. The personnel told me the information she has is the same &#34;product guide&#34; (which comes with the product)."
"I received on time, but with damage on the door and left side and with out grill,I'm not so happy"
It worked for three weeks and now it won't start. Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back. What a pain.
"I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews.  We bought this because it fit our space, but the door button broke.  The door won't open when the button is pushed, it just unlatches and you have to pry it open.  What's worse, the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine.  He refused to replace anything."
"After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.  Amazon cannot reimburse for it - you MUST wait for the vender.  Me?  I'm still waiting for my $500. Caveat Emptor!<br />September 13 - Update - Item arrived back at the vender today.  I'm still waiting for my $500."
"We purchased this microwave, and then realized that 2 cu ft. is WAY too big for a family of three. We hoped to exchange it for a smaller one.<br /><br />Sharp told us that we were responsible for shipping (fair enough), but also that we would have to pay a 30% restocking fee.<br /><br />This is absurd. Who's ever heard of a 30% restocking fee? We never even removed this from the cardboard box- we simply opened the top, and then re-closed it. 30% seems like usury to me. Frankly, I can't believe Amazon would allow a merchant to charge a 30% restocking fee. I'm positive their Cost of Goods Sold isn't much more than 30%... what are they doing, just trashing returns?<br /><br />Anyway, even if I were going to buy a Sharp microwave again, I certainly wouldn't buy it HERE, and reward these unfair business practices.<br /><br />We own a business, and we expect to be treated as consumers, the same way we treat our customers.. that simply isn't happening here."
"I loved the small size of this microwave, but the power was lacking. Furthermore, after we had this unit for 1 month, it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes. The light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin, but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking. We returned this product."
All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect. Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model. Wish I knew that before purchasing.
Microwave does it's job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year.
"This microwave SUCKS and so does the seller!!!! I purchased this microwave in April because I was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave.  Well how I said I purchased it in April, but didn't install it until the beginning of August.  The delivery was fast, but when I reccieved it, two of the back corners were dented, but I decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it.  It is now October and it has gone out on me.  I was about to warm up my dinner when I pressed start and BOOM it went out.  It turned off just like that.  It never turned back on. I am really dissapointed becasue I thought I had purchased a good quality product.  I contacted the seller and he said to call Samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty.  Well it is under warranty, but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from Lowes.  He's a liar becasue Lowes does NOT sell refurbished units.  So now I'm out a couple hundred $$$ and now I have to purchase a new one.  People please listen to the reviews and don't buy this microwave, whether it's her or some other place.  Save yourselves time, money, and dissapointment.  Also, do NOT buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and NOT helpfull. I only give it one star because I have to give it a 1-5 or else I would give it a 0."
This was a reeplacement purchase.  Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased.  The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired.  Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning.  Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned.  Often requires multiple attempts to start.  contacted seller who defered back to GE.  Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor.  My recommendation is to avoid both (vendor and product)if possible.
"I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly."
"When I opened the box, I saw the corner next to the push button was lose.  The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front, everything else is either painted metal and plastic.   I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer"
"Update:<br />After 16 months we have the same problem as others. It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability, not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical.  However, I can rate the features and design of the unit. I like the size, the power and the large turntable.  The controls, however, were poorly designed.  For example, to cook at anything other than full power, you need to press the power level repeatedly. The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10%. So, to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button."
"We bought this, from Amazon, in July.  No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.  I do enjoy this microwave, I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable.      If you have problems, keep good records, stay with factory authorized service and be persistent."
I never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut.  I had to send it back.  Darn.  Amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem.  I am pleased with Amazon's service.
"One week after installing this over-the-stove, convection microwave, the stainless steel interior began to look spotted. A white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside. Sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it. He concluded the metal interior's defect, whereupon Sharp said they would replace (but not pay for reinstallation of) the unit. Removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me $140!!! That wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online. Sharp's customer service will not compensate. I would have been MUCH better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this. Live and learn. It is more than one month after the inspection and I have not received the replacement (said to be on back-order but still available online!!!).  <br />Aside from the interior cosmetic defect, the microwave looks great and works fine."
"One of my worst Amazon purchases. I hate this microwave and deeply regret purchasing it.  It is GIANT and heavy, sits crooked on a flat surface, and heats food unevenly!  You can get WAY better for LESS MONEY!!!!!  Shocked, because usually Amazon reviews are so spot on."
I bought this microwave for my parents for Christmas. After six months it died.  My father has been attempting to get his refund processed for the past month and they keep giving him the run around. Don't buy this product!!!
Terrible microwave. doesn't heat the food yet the outside of the microwave gets hot. never had a microwave that gets hot on the outside. working with the supplier to replace it.
Dont buy it!!!<br />The button will be defective after 8 months
This microwave worked fine for some 3 months and then started problem with door. I was totally disappointed seeing problem in just 3 months. Customer service was rude and unhelpful.
Horrible waiting for a refund
it's starting not to work well - takes too long to heat food and leaves cold and hot spots.
Late Package Delivery. Damaged Item.
"This has to be the worst microwave I have ever purchased. It arrived without the internal clock, it is completely missing, so obviously it didn't function out of the box. And I can't get a replacement for another week, this is awful. I know microwaves are just a convenience but having just moved we don't have one and this was timed to arrive just in time for our new home. Total disappointment in both the product and Amazon."
Does not work will be sending back
Missing the turnable shaft. Can't use it without this part. Will alter feedback once problem is resolved.
"Unit defective upon arrival, could not be repaired after two attempts and numerous phone calls to Samsung.  Not recommended unless you like wasting your time and not having a microwave for a month after purchase."
"Absolute piece of junk from an unsavory seller. Do not buy this microwave. It was refurbished and I didn't know. The cord had been &#34;trimmed&#34; by the previous owner so it could fit through a hole, quite a surprise. Didn't come with templates to install, had to buy separate. Door closes way too hard and noisy.<br /><br />And now it's dead one year later! I had my previous microwave for 9 years.<br /><br />Total junk. Wish I could give the microwave zero stars."
Broke in less then 60 days
"Terrible product, broke down after one month of light use.."
"We have had this microwave for 2 months. It makes the scariest noises, like there is metal in it but there is not. The plate also does not spin properly. Very low quality. Go with a brand you trust!"
Very small and very low power. Takes forever to heat anything up.
Try a different brand. I bought this in August and it shorted out in February.  It was nice while it lasted but has a dangerous flaw. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
I got the product out of the box and it doesn't work. It will do everything but heat up inside. I need to ship it back but between work and school there's no time. I will just ask for my money back.
Terrible product. Cheaply made. Horrible review all around.
"Lasted 1 1/2 years.  Flimsy cardboard inlet cover on the left side of microwave, naturally absorbed some food during use.  Now, this cardboard has somewhat deteriorated, the machine is simply a very large fire hazard.  Catches fire immediately.  Not safe, terrible design."
"I bought it, I got it, I tried it, I returned it. 'Nuff said! Seriously, it doesn't appear to be a lasting product."
"Do not buy this.  You would get better value by throwing money out into the street.  Mine lasted three weeks, and then became entirely useless.  If you buy one of these and pay for it, you will end up with no money and no microwave."
stopped working after 3 months.  total junk.
This item dod not work from the second i opened the nox
"I would never have bought this appliance if I had known the inlet cover (which seems like just a piece of cardboard) is just tacked on the inside of the microwave.  I've never seen that before.  It's not listed in the item description. I guess I didn't read enough of the product reviews.  While I do cover food in the microwave, it seems like it will get dirty and then damaged by things like butter from popcorn that will randomly leak out of the bag during popping.  Reviews for generic replacement inlet covers of this type say that they may catch fire due to food residue that is hard to clean off."
worked for 1/2 day.
"Came damaged, but did not see til after use. Hard to read, just not worth the money. Put in garage and went back to our $59 sams club microwave"
"Do not buy this ever. When door closes it automatically turns on and you are unable to start any kind of cooking options, very annoying. Only a 30 day return policy too."
"I have extensive experience in refinishing metals; it is difficult to get paint to adhere to aluminum.<br />I power-sanded the entire interior down to bare metal.<br />Contrary to the LABEL claims, THIS PAINT DOES NOT ADHERE TO BARE METAL!!<br />Once dried, it scrapes off with your fingernail.<br />Q: The factory paint failed despite having been primed so how could this paint work with No Primer??<br />A: IT CAN'T!<br />If I were to repeat this process, I'd have first primed it with a high-temp, self-etching automotive primer.<br />Maybe then there'd be a prayer of success...<br />Bottom Line: Unless you're willing to go thru the tedious process of properly preparing AND PRIMING, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.<br />PS:  (2) Cans are required to adequately refinish the entire interior"
"SO DISAPPOINTED!! Bought this July 2013 and our kitchen was not ready yet, so we didn't put it in until a few months ago and it worked fine- we probably used it only couple dozen times and my husband went to warm up our daughters food Wednesday and NOTHING! Completely &#34;dead&#34;! Will not turn on, no buttons works, etc.<br /><br />This is extremely disappointing and our warranty was up July 2014!!<br /><br />This is why you do not spend $800 on a microwave and I will NEVER purchase a SHARP product ever again!!!!!!<br /><br />Totally sad and disappointed."
It did not work upon arrival
Did not work so I returned it
"The button to open the microwave door is too tight. You need both hands to open the door. If I'm not too lazy, I would return it."
Cheap quality.<br />But you always get what you pay for :(
"Got it detected right from the box... The lights work, control panel etc, but it doesn't produce any heat! 5 minutes and nothing... Really sad about the quality. Amazon send me a broken device."
poorly built
"I purchased this item brand new. I used it only a few times in a period on less than 2 months. It failed in less than 30 minutes of use. Amazon's return policy doesn't cover this item, and nobody keeps the product box so the manufacturer warranty may be worthless (more in shipping than product is worth). Do not buy this item."
works fines initially then as the title says I literally got a puff of black smoke and it was dead.
"We purchased the MW in Janurary, our contractor installed it the last week of April, it died two days later and Sharp service took three weeks/ two service calls only to have it go out ten minutes after they left. Amazon assures me that it will be resolved but not the seller. They want to repeatly waste our time and call service, have us wait then what? DON'T BUY THIS MICROWAVE."
"I *hope* I sent in my warranty card!  I am calling the company today to request a refund.  I have not liked this microwave at all, and now it suddenly died.  I definitely want my money back.<br /><br />Edited:<br />I called the company and they told me to call Amazon.  I called Amazon and they issued a full refund.<br /><br />I do not recommend this microwave.  It is so flimsy that I had to hold it still with one hand in order to push buttons with the other.  Otherwise, it would slide across the counter."
This is the worst microwave I have ever owned.  It takes twice as long to heat food.  We also have owned it for only a few months and the key pad broke.
"My understanding is this paint comes 2 ways, 1 with a small brush like fingernail paint and the other in a spray can application, by the looks of this picture I thought this was the brush application bottle not the spray bottle but I received the spray bottle and could not contact the company to exchange it. No one answered the phone but they said to leave a message but the message box was full."
"Disapointed in the fan suction. Doesn't seem to be pulling the air from over the stove, almost like there is a ducting leak, because there is plenty of air blowing."
"Had to return it , received less than half the $ I paid for it.  Bulky, odd shape very difficult to find suitable space for it. Like I had an old TV on my counter. UGLY very .ugly"
The microwave is sparking while heating we are sending it back for a replacement will hope it works this time
"I know I purchased a refurbished unit, but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable.  I'm returning this unit."
I bought this microwave in October for a kitchen we are having remodeled.  Got it installed about 3 weeks ago and was microwaving some bacon last night and smelled a funny electrical burning smell.  It is apparently fried (which is what I'll be doing with my bacon until this POS is either fixed or replaced.  The top of the unit was extremely hot and it is just totally dead and unresponsive.  Not even a light.<br /><br />I saw all of the bad reviews but there aren't many drawer microwave options and even brands like Wolf and Thermadore are still produced by Sharp.  Very disappointing.  We'll see how the service from Sharp goes...
"One of the pieces that ensures the screws from the top of the cabinet holds the microwave in place was missing, so we cannot install it until Samsung rectifies the matter.  Seems crazy to send it back though since it's just missing a 50 cent bolt that can't be replaced at the hardware store....."
This is the SECOND one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months. I don't recommend it at all.
"After the smoke has cleared from the house, discovered microwave burnt out.  Thank God for Home Warranty!  Don't buy! YUCK!  Can't believe the reviews- all universally the same, except mine lasted just under a year!  It's a crying shame a product fails so soon!"
Microwave didn't work when I received it.  It was really disappointing.  It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it.
Unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it! Ordered again thru one of the big box hardware chains and it also arrived beat to heck. They say third time is a charm. We'll see...
"Bought this microwave in June 2012 for a kitchen remodel. Its barley 5 months old and although I have not experienced the dreaded 5E error, the unit has already started acting funny. The last few days the unit will loose the time and display please set time. This AM while making oat meal for my daughter, I opened the unit and it was dead. No light like it was unplugged. Closed and the display listed all 0's across. Opened door again no light. After a few times the light went on and unit was operational. Subsequently  I did do the stop/enter key diagnostic test and all it showed me was 1816s (model) and 110512A, which I assume means 1105watts 12amps? I hope this is not a precursor to the 5E error? Thinking the seller acquired refurbished units from another party (i.e.Samsung, Lowes?) and has been pawning them off as new here. I am going to check to see if my appliance repair plan that I pay for from my utility company will covers microwaves, if not new unit for me."
Wouldn't work.  Have to return it.  The word 'door' keeps showing up as if there is a problem with the door.<br />There is no problem.
"Received it and installed it. The fan went on and the fan blew but it did not heat.  It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part (magnitron). It turned out to be something else, I can't remember what, so they have to order that. I am still waiting.  Fortunately my old microwave (Amana) still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated. The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components, from Korea.  Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up.  I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on."
This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products
Haven't returned item because seem to be complicated return policy and not given clear answer on step. The actually ad is different than the actual product.
"We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed. After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another. We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
I have been shipped TWO of these microwaves and they were both DOA. Different issues. Sharp might consider testing them before they leave the factory. I won't purchase another sharp microwave. The customer service was slow and did nothing to help me. I could haul it to a local service center and they said that the tech might be able to fix it while I waited but I've been to enough service centers to know that this is not likely. I'm not happy at all.
Door broke near the handle in less than one year.  Had the door replaced under warranty.  Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year (but now it's out of warranty!).  New door costs over $100.  Serious design or manufacturing flaw.  I can't recommend this microwave.  Very disappointed.
"I am changing my five star to a one star review.<br /><br />The product cooked food well, but despite gentle use (we read reviews here noting a cracked door), our door has cracked, then cracked again, and then the handle itself has snapped off.  The material quality is very poor.  We were very gentle with this unit, but it's simply a very low quality product.<br /><br />Absolutely do not purchase this."
"I have not had a single good reading from this thermometer, better off spending a little more on a better thermometer."
"was expecting alot with all the great reviews, but ended up having to return it for 2 reasons.<br />1.  it must be doused in chemicals as it smells like paint when you open the box.  not sure if it gets better with washing or airing it out.  it was so strong, i didn't want to try.<br />2.  it's heavy.  being this is meant for transport (picnic, park, etc.) and you'll be carrying it around, it's crazy heavy!  guessing that means it's really sturdy and good quality, but too heavy for me to deal with."
"the sippy cups seem very nice, my child has had no problems using them, but she dropped one from her highchair and it shattered.  with the frequency of how often she drops the sippy cups, i need something more durable."
"cute gate and quality materials used, but i have tried it on the inside of the door frame, on the door frame, and even across different walls outside of doors with no luck on making a secure grip. either my apartment is completely abnormal or the measurements for the gate are off bc my 2 lb kitten can knock it right over making my purchase completely useless."
"Cute product, but does not arrive with any product information or in a sealed package."
Nice.  But aterrizar a week of use the drawing almost vanished. It is a pity.
not steady very cheap quality
"although these fit my medela pump in style advanced, they had very poor suction. i would suggest sticking with the medela brand valves and membranes."
"these are really cheaply made.  after installing them all, i found that most of the catches (either the hook part or the eye part or both) broke when i tried (gently) to open the drawers to test them.  they are hard and brittle.  maybe i got a defective batch, but there is no way i would even buy this brand again."
"one day old and the back started making squeaky noice, i have tried reassembling it but still the same. its too big to send it back.. stuck with the squeaky noice...."
broke during 1st nap time use. very dissapionted
"The item I received is not the item I ordered.  The one pictured shows a separate syringe and separate medicine dispenser where the baby could suck as you push the medicine in OR you could just have the medicine part separate so they can just suck on it like a pacifier.  But I really wanted to be able to leave the syringe in so the medicine ONLY goes to the nipple and not the surrounding areas like other medicine dispsensers (I have the Munchkin one and meds get trapped around the rim.  The one I recieved is an all in one that I could buy at any Walmart, Target, etc.  I wanted the one pictured because it is separate and easier to dose small amounts.  The one I received is a white syringe with a clear pacifier nipple and the smallest dose amount you can dose out in it is 2.5mL.  I need one to be able to dose 1.25mL so this one is not even one I would order in the first place.  Also, the nipple part of this is HARD AS A ROCK.  No way an infant would find this appropriate to suck on and effectively get the medicine.<br /><br />SO disappointed.  I wanted the Mini Medicator pictured here and did NOT get that."
the body of the caterpillar has small mold spots. I feel like the pacifier should be able to come off the body in order to give it a proper wash.
bought this 'same' unit last year but this year's model doesn't fit.  too tall.  need to crush it down to be able to fit the cover properly and make it fit. too much bother to return.  hopefully it will still work in this 'crushed' state.
in the picture has 8 colors and i thought i was getting the 8 headbands but really dissapointed because i only got one. i shoulded read better and it says one pc.
this gate is not meant for the top of the stairs.  it takes 2 hands to open it (even says this in the user manual).  not very functional when you don't have both hands free to open it (carrying your kid or anything else).
"it was cute as pictured, but we bought it so that my grandson would not poke his legs through the bars. but it flattened easily and out his legs came out. we have tightened it and the same thing happens."
None available.
These left a bright red sunburn looking mark everywhere they touched my son's face.  The unflavored avent soothies do not. I love the avent products. These however are not really worth trying. Stick with the normal ones.
"These pacifiers would have been perfect if they had a curve to their shields. They're flat and don't hug the face, so they don't stay in the mouth very long, which is a shame because they look absolutely adorable."
Why does is say STRETCH??? Nothing about is stretches.. We picked this one instead of any of the others because we thought it would stretch and be fun for or daughter but nope no stretching!!!!!
i didn't like the way this fit the crib - was saggy and would not tighten despite several attempts. returned.
1- the bumper bare &#34;broken&#34;<br />2- brake wire &#34;cut off&#34;
None available.
"doesn't fit a graco stroller. graco strollers have to be taken completely apart for these to even begin to work. these are not easily used unless you cut them to fit them over bars. for some reason, even if you glue them to the handles, they don't stick.<br /><br />graco strollers need a different solution to the replacement situation. this product isn't it. i wish the product info would have said &#34;not for graco strollers&#34; in the description. i wouldn't have wasted my time and money."
"the sound on the monitor often cuts out, so we don't even know if the baby is crying at night! additionally, the camera screen started to get fuzzy after just 3 months.  also don't like that you can't adjust the camera left/right, or up/down, from the monitor."
this is not at all for a newbirn. the small is more for a toddler. returning because way too big for our 1 month old
My daughter hates these pacis. She refuses to use them because the nipple is too big. I don't know how other babies like them but they were a huge miss in my house.
"Do not use these!  My daughter loved these from the time she was born until she was two and it RUINED her teeth and her bite. She has a cross bite now and the dentist says she is going to need a ton of orthodontics when she gets older. I thought it was no big deal at first and would just impact her baby teeth. WRONG.  A pacifier can change the way the teeth grow in and a child's bite---and adult teeth are going to come in the same way the baby teeth are.  If you use a pacifier, I highly recommend using one with a better shape that won't impact the teeth as much.  You can read descriptions of other pacifiers that will say things like &#34; promote healthy oral development by naturally fitting into your baby's palate&#34;.  Do your research--wish i did."
I was originally excited to see these available. My son could find his binki without needing assistance. But I should have known that would be too good to be true. First you have to put it in the sun to be activated. Which with a new baby I could not remember to do. But secondly and most importantly it only glowed for 10 minutes. What is the point of that? We use it just as a normal binki.
"VERY stiff, not cuddly at all! GET THE pink elephant, Brown monkey, or tabby cat instead. My daughter had them when she was an infant and loved them, they were super SOFT."
"The bear I recieved was dark brown, not as cute as this one pictured."
our mattress sagged significantly after only three months of use for an infant weighing less than 12lbs. amazon customer service was very helpful in expediting our return.
"first we loved this playard. even though it had a very strong plastic smell in the beginning. it is spacious and fun for a baby. but (as a lot of reviews mentioned) the bottom mat doesn't stay flat, and keeps getting up, not only are there waves of material but the wooden boards inside started to overlap. even though we never once disassembled it, it has always stayed in one place with the occasional dust wiping!<br />we returned it after some time! we found this playard inconvenient and potentially dangerous for a baby who is rolling over and just starting to crawl."
these are the cheapest bibs i have ever owned.  do not waste your money.  after washing them they have holes all around the neck!!! very cheap
"can't, for the life of me, get this on the bottle. classic case of great in theory..."
"i bought this because i had read reviews that it would work on a brick hearth, it turned out to be a complete waste of my money. the tape it came with is in fact very sticky, but not nearly enough to work.  i am back to square one, minus the money i wasted. if you are concerned about tabletops and the like, this is a good choice."
"i bought these to use on my son when he was about 18 months old and i also bought a different brand at the same time... i did not like the piyo piyo ones. they are too thick and have a rough edge that i really don't like for getting a clean, gentle cut. i can't imagine trying to use these on a newborn or infant - i don't even like using them on myself!"
you get what you pay for. this barely stayed on my toddler...
"handles ripped the first time i tried to transfer laundry to my laundry basket. obviously, it cannot be used to carry laundry - my daughter did this and the handle completely ripped off as she walked down the stairs."
"i'm sitting in my hotel right now exhausted from carrying my infant i his sling all day because he refuses to get into this uppababy stroller. i purchased this stroller  specifically for this trip to canada. i wanted something lightweight to bring with us on the plane and this stroller won over the maclaren triumph only because it has a larger canopy. i don't know if umbrella strollers just don't have suspension or shock absorption but my 8 mo old refuses to get into this stroller and cries every time i strap him in. the wheels are smooth plastic that look and feel cheap.<br /><br />now, on day 4 of our trip, i am very weary of even going out and exploring the city since my only other option is to put him in the sling.<br /><br />the good features this stroller has are:<br />large canopy<br />mesh backing<br />lightweight<br />ease of folding and unfolding<br /><br />this worthless stroller pretty much put a damper on our trip. going forward, we'll be bringing our awesome stokke scoot even though it's inconvenient."
"i liked the product while it lasted. despite gentle use and painstakingly counting my wipes before filling the pouch one of the two cases i received split by end of the zipper after approximately one month of use. the concept is great, but quality is obviously an issue."
"my baby didn't like it!! she never sleep on it comfortably ,it's flimsy and small. i don't think any baby can sleep in it more than a month or so.."
"it is a low quality, so I return it. Later I go to babierus to purchase this item. It is very good"
"i have had this highchair for a few months and wish i did more research before buying. the cover does not come off so you can't wash it and wiping it down is not enough. also, you need 2 hands to put the tray on. the tray usually doesn't allign right and takes some time to get it right. i thought the highchair came with a 5 point harness but does not. my baby slides and falls to the side while eating. this causes her discomfort since her arm gets all red from being pinned to the side or stuck hanging over the chair. wishing i bought another highchair 馃槙"
"This wubbanub works fine. And for baby, looks great! You can't tell by the picture, but the face of the bear is completely flat. It looks super odd from the side like someone punched the nose in. The belly of the bear is in the same fabric as the feet, which are ribbed - this makes it look like a crocodile. Baby isn't going to care about any of this, but adults should. It's kind of ugly in person!"
This thing smells like an old pool float and looked moldy out of package.
I do not get completely miss article bpa free
"Cheaply made materials. My daughter (2) just got hers. It cracked when she stepped on it ,and the second one got a hole in it from her just nibbling it (she nibbles at her MAM pacifiers all the time, and has ten of those. None of them have a single bit of damage from her nibbling.). In my opinion, it's a bit pricey for not too good of a product."
app freezes from time to time and we don't feel it is reliable for an all night monitor. app is also difficult to get more than one devise or allow more than one user to view simultaneously. good for monitoring for short periods of time. would not recommend.
"May be just my child, but the cheap basic pacifiers seem to stay in his mouth better and he likes them more."
"Kind of cool<br />Concept, but no way to sanitize soother, as it doesn't detach . Overpriced , overrated in my opinion."
"Love these pacifiers for my daughter, but when I recieved them there was a hole in the end of one of them. I didn't realize this until after she had swallowed a lot of air making her very colicy for the next week. Please be aware that they may have holes. Disappointed in this purchase. Switched pacifiers."
I thought i was going to recieve these adorable paci's that was shown one having a car and the other having a plane on it i was so excited!! Until i opend them....one had a motorcycle and the other a lions face馃様 i never seen that option listed...
"um a new mother , nd i had to set my baby&#34;s feeding schedules...bcs initially baby dsnt know much difference between suckin and feeding ..and to avoid all time crying we need to pacify him time to time  ..i was using avent pacifiers previously n they came with a cap too ..for hygiene .. Then later..  i bought these to giv a try and  was really disappointed bcs my 2 month baby didnot like it at all...<br />  ..so um happy with my previous ones...:)"
"This is not the real one , i have an original one and this one isn't feel the same so disspointed"
nipple broke very quickly (ive owned tons of wubbanubs)<br />this one broke super fast
Only came with two but overall I liked them
"the description stated this gate would expand to 6 feet, but no matter what i did i couldn't get it do that.  out of the box it appeared that it would be easy to assemble, but it wasn't.  you have to extend both rods simultaneously or it will get too snug on one side, preventing you from extending the rod on the other side.  i ended up bending a rod just trying to assemble it.  i sent it back."
"there are many reasons why we enjoyed this product in the short term, and one *very* important reason why we don't in the long-term.  the negative, which is a big safety issue, needs to come first:  the feet of the wubbanub are weighted with bean-bag beans.  our (still quite young) baby loves to chew on all parts of the animal, not just the paci, and the seams are *not* tightly sewn: two feet have opened up.  as another poster noted, the beans are contained within a mesh compartment inside the animal feet, but get through the plush and you're right up next to that.  i've sewed up one of the frayed feet, but there is little fabric at the seam to allow safe or easy repair.  particularly now that our baby has the beginnings of two teeth (which, i might add, came after the seams sprang, not before), i am reluctant to leave the wubbanub alone with her in her swing or car seat lest she gnaw into the beans by mistake, which could be disastrous.  we're going to have to retire this toy.  the obvious safety issues at stake here make any follow-up comments superfluous--it's non-negotiable in my book.  but i will allow that this is disappointing because our baby loved her wubbanub, and spent a lot of time learning to manipulate it.  it was her very first toy in terms of something she interacted with, and i think it actually helped her development in a number of ways.  she'd probably like to keep it around for a while, but i just can't do it on these terms.  i hope a redesign might come up with some other way of weighting the feet."
i received it fast but it doesn't seem to be working absolutely nothing seems to really be working actually. i also feel that it was to tight around my sons neck i didn't feel it was safe!
"not what expected! pictures above are not the real product! they are not foam, cheap material"
"the sound stopped working after two years. worked well until then, but for the money it should last longer."
front wheel shakes at a walking speed. a plastic piece wore through on the canopy a month after my son was born (so with little to no use). cheaply made.
"When I purchased this, I thought I was purchasing a bracelet for an adult, that could be used as a teething instrument for a baby(while being worn by an adult) This is an actual baby bracelet to be worn by a baby and used for teething. I will say that it has a sturdy clasp, but even so, it is a choking hazard. A baby should not wear a bracelet precisely because it could be a choking hazard. Even with a sturdy clasp, all that chewing and sucking could undo the clasp (it is plastic that screws together)."
"Our baby tolerates them but they are not the same shape at all as the closer to nature bottle nipples, which is the whole reason I bought them. She would rather suck on an empty bottle nipple; also the plastic packaging is not a case as it would seem. It has no means of resealing once the tape is cut. The glow is the only redeeming factor as it is nice to see if she is still sucking on one in the dark."
straw cleaner broke within one day of use. other parts are ok but the straw cleaner is the one you want to use! usually love oko products but this is badly made.
"i wanted to love this product, but to work well it would requires to have the same size as the juice box i uses and it doesn't. my son would pull the juice box away and the box loses its purpose"
It is very cute but the toy doesn't hold it in her mouth. Not worth the money
this item is not really like it is shown it's really wobbly and doesn't hold anything .. i thought it would have been more sturdy but it's not ... i didn't like it
these are a joke. the crayon that goes inside the plastic sleeve falls out very easy. when you are done in the bath or shower the crayon is wet from use so it will continue to leak a colored water all over the tube until it is dry. cleans up fairly easy just annoying. this bath toy would do best for children at least 4 yrs and older. my two year old likes to make the crayon come out and either try to eat it or break it apart.<br />would not recommend.
"Warning! This is a novelty item only.  I bought this one because it's advertised as AVENT and it is, however, it is a piece of black plastic cut out in the shape of a mustache hot glued on to an AVENT pacifier. This CANNOT be boiled to be sanitized or it will fall apart which is not in the listing at all.  Suddenly I wish I had purchased one of the cheaper and sanitizer friendly alternatives that I saw."
"well, this product is good as described but the only problem that i found was the paint from the bird is coming off and that's is my only problem with this bouncer because babies will chew in all the plastic toys but this one is the only one that i notice the paint is coming  off. just be aware of this paint problem."
Way too difficult and frustrating to open.  I threw mine away. The Munchkin Deluxe mesh feeders are my favorite and then the Sassy ones.  Be sure to buy the mesh feeders with the cover.<br /><br />Buy this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Deluxe-Fresh-Feeder-Yellow/dp/B00JQSITZA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1424874593&sr=8-2&keywords=mesh+feeder
"decided to try these for my daughter because they were a good deal and i liked that they came in packs of 5.  unfortunately my baby wouldn't keep them in her mouth.  maybe because they are too small?  didn't get any use out of them at all, stuck with the tommee tipee pacifiers which work great."
when i tried it with my granddaughter it poured out thru the spout and it also leaked from around the lid so bad till she was not able to use it for a training cup like it said you could. i also ordered the pink one but they sent me the blue. i think you should get what you pay for to be right i ordered two of them and they both are like this. peggydrink@yahoo.com    i think that the company should reminisce my money for both of them because they are of no use as a training cup and that is what i ordered. peggydrink@yahoo.com  best of luck to anyone who buys these. i would like to have what i ordered to have worked.
"the parent unit keeps dying, even after being fully charged. the lights on both units are too bright"
love them!!!!
"Extremely dissapointed with this product.  I purchased in Sept 2014 but did not begin using it until my baby arrived home on Oct 20th 2014.  Overnight it finally $h*t itself completely.  The monitor no longer connects with the camera, nothing I do works, it's fried.  So that is the end of the slow and painful death of my Levana Keera - it took just four months, and definitely not worth the $160ish bucks I handed over for it.<br /><br />At the beginning (before any issues began). I thought it was an average product, I did like the camera pan feature, but that's about it,  picture quality during the day was ok, the more light the better, but not helpful if your baby needs the room for sleeping.  Night vision was very blurry, I could never make out if my babies eyes were open or closed.<br />The wireless connectivity between camera and monitor has always been patchy, cutting in and out, often the sound would not transmit, it would either cut in and out or go completely out until I would realize and have to manually reconnect or par the two.  Also the monitor would constantly default back to the menu screen, so I would glance at the monitor only to see a bunch of icons, not reliable whatsoever.<br /><br />I wasted my money, and now I need to spend more doe on a new baby monitor, hopefully my next purchase serves me better."
"sometimes they work sometimes they don't. so, no they aren't good."
had for only 3 months and it now turns itself off in the middle of the night....will be contacting amazon for a full refund!
"They barely glow in the dark. Ended up getting the MAM glow in the dark pacifier, much, much better!"
The item I received was obviously used.  The box had been opened and the plastic on the product was smudged.  When buying something to sterilize and clean items for your baby it's really important that the product hasn't been used.
"Far too strongly scented.  My son doesn't mind them a bit, but I find the smell off-putting.  And this is coming from someone who has a newborn, and is therefore used to baby smells!"
"I got what I paid for I suppose, but this was very cheap. The pacifiers had to be cutout and use tape maybe? We didn't use it at the shower after all."
"My baby only takes these soothie for 0-3months. Now that she is 7 months and she's got one tooth out, we purchased this. My baby doesn't take it at all. And it keeps coming off her mouth. I think it is much more harder for her to suck. I understand why the material has got to be harder and thicker for older babies but if they don't take it at all, what is the point at all?"
I ordered these and chose the dots style and I did see that colors may vary but why give the option to choose? I recieved two blue pacifiers when I was hoping for something more feminine.
None available.
It was very warm to wear this on a hot summer day and its summer every day in SIngapore! Totally not feasible in our climate and does not work in air-conditioned malls as well. Baby hates it!
the stuff animal fell off with in first week.
"the idea behind this product is great! i often struggle with my daughters squeezing pouches and making a huge mess so i was excited to find this. unfortunately, the closures are not very tight and they are able to open them and take the pouches out. was actually going to see about returning them. would definitely purchase in the future if the company figured out how to make them a bit more kid proof"
the first thing i noticed was the hanger was rusty! this had flimsy material and top stches by hanger were already coming undone. the style was dated and did not look modern at all. i returned this one.
"while i like the concept of table toppers, this one is not one that i would recommend.  it sticks well on most surfaces, but the print on the table topper is too bright and distracting.  our 1-year old sometimes can't spot little pieces of food lying right there in front of her!  i would have much preferred a simpler design (preferably without cartoon characters) and a lighter color."
Light bulbs burn out all the time. Not just fan. Doing it on another fan we ordered from this company.
"My husband ordered these for our two month old because he loves this brand of pacifier, and we thought these would be an easy transition from breast to bottle. They seem like great bottles. The nipple quality is amazing, it never collapses. My one star is for the supposed anti colic feature. You could loudly hear my son swallowing tons of air while eating, and he would scream for hours after using one of these. He also chokes and splutters during feedings. We have three other bottle brands and he has no issue with any of those."
The logo faded within a month. All colors within a week. What a cheap product!
"these are very thin and therefore do not absorb much liquid, which is the primary purpose of a feeding bib! instead i used muslin cloths wrapped around like a bandana and tucked under baby's chin."
"a cool idea.  give it to a toddler and tell him/her that they have to hold it by the handle for it not to spill.  or not to drop it because the bowl will pop put.  yeah right, see how well that works for you.<br /><br />it's now a toy box item.  one step above the trash can.  save your money."
These pacifiers are not the same as the ones you purchase through a retailer. My daughter loves this brand and she would not take the ones I purchased on Amazon. The sucking part is a yellow color and I'm not even sure they are silicon.
"WARNING! This item in NOT an authentic WubbaNub! I purchased because my daughter loves her authentic caterpillar WubbaNub. This one came in a cheap plastic bag, unlike the plastic cylinder that is cute enough to gift like the authentic ones. The quality of this one is much cheaper, much smaller, weighted less than the authentic. I also compared the tags on the rear of the animals and the difference is obvious. LOVE LOVE LOVE the authentic, this one is going back ASAP. Hope this helps!"
"These are NOT the Hawaii Medical gumdrop pacifiers.  They are Jolly Pops, which are not as soft as the Gumdrop pacifiers. My baby would not take these.  Buyer beware."
"as other reviewers have stated, this is not very powerful.  its size is nice but it just doesn't do the job."
i wish i could give it zero stars. it's always blinking or flashing green lights. can't go upstairs without static. after six months it crapped out and it needs battery replacement even though it's constantly plugged into the wall!!
There is no curve for the teeth. It's just one straight nipple
"it works.  but compared to the other bottles available out there, the material is flimsy and the design is cheap.  and good luck cleaning those tubes after each feeding. i use it once in a blue moon when we go on a long car ride,<br />lo is screaming for a bottle and we are unable to stop and feed him.  not worth purchasing."
"we've only had this monitor for a little over a year and the motor and the sound have now stopped working, conveniently right after the one year warranty. this monitor was expensive and i would not waste the money."
"i use this as a wet bag. i love the print, thats why i bought it in the first place. its a medium size, will hold about 6 soiled diapers and 6-12 soiled inserts. perfect for on the go. i love the mesh zipper pouch in the front also so you can keep dry/clean inserts in the same bag. perfect for a large diaper bag!<br /><br />***upadte***<br />its been just a few weeks since i received and reviewed this product. i have now had a 180.<br />this bag has started to leak. the waterproof inner has begun tearing at the seams. small little slits all along the sides. i wash it probably once a week since i do rotate between two wet bags with my diapers, so really not that often. i thought that it was a great buy until this issue started. i would rather spend more for another kanga care bag :( sad, because i do love the print and the wet and dry pockets."
"very cheap quality, and they do not fit mam pacifiers, which are my son's favorite. i do not recommend purchasing."
"great monitor in the beginning. after 13 month (1 month past warranty), the camera lost the ability to move and zoom in. too much money for something that'll break in 13 months.  like i said, it worked great for 13 months but i rated it one star because i expected it to last a little longer."
"i hate this thing. i heard great reviews so i bought it hiping itd help with my discomfort. i'm 5'2 and 140lbs (7 months pregnant.) i don't know how anyone finds a comfortable position with this thing. it's super firm and not flexible at all. my body just doesn't fit in it. i want to return it but already threw the packaging out like an idiot, so i guess i have a $50 cat bed. awesome."
I expected the matress to be firm but this one was as hard as a rock. The matress my playard came with is softer than this (which isn't very comfortable in the first place). Will be returning and looking for another option to help our 18 month old sleep better when we travel.
"doesn't fit my crib. my crib has a standard size, but it doesn't fit around the exterior legs. can't even use. unfortunately i washed before trying on my crib, so now i can't return."
"i bought this as a replacement for avent 8 ounce cup. since i could not find the avent 8 ounce cup anymore, i bought this one as it said 8 ounce in the title. but actually it is a 5 ounce cup and if you top it up to maximum possible limit it comes close to 8 ounce but there are no measurements after 5 ounce mark.<br />also it is very easy to misalign the internal spout to the lid, and when that happens this leaks very badly.<br />it was a big mistake that i bought this and had i noticed these defects before i opened this i would have returned this as clearly the title is misleading."
"these work. my two year old still can't open these. the only reason i'm not giving five stars is because they don't come in all white.<br /><br />update from 4 to 1 star: four years and two kids later i'm attempting to remove these. this has been such an arduous process, that i'm starting to wonder if it was worth it having children at all. a complete kitchen renovation might be easier than removing 16 of these sticky things that have cemented onto my kitchen and bathroom cabinets. some reviewers spoke of removal tabs, and 'easy to remove', but i have not been so lucky. my cabinets are never going to be the same. buyer beware!"
This item fell apart within 1 week of having it. The diaper changing bag is nice and study but this is cheap and poorly constructed.
You have to really struggle to open the container - completely un-usable.
it's to much work to clean
"This was a very disappointing purchase. The swaddle material is WAY too flexible. It allowed my 10 lb 6 week old baby to maneuver his way out of it.  That should NOT happen with a baby this tiny and with such unintentional, immature movements. So, getting past that...the &#34;weights&#34; (sewn in bean bags like the little ones you toss) are awkwardly placed. I think if they would place Velcro on the inside and some velcro on a couple bean bags...it would work better. When you finally stretch out this material and get baby all wrapped up...you'll find the weights are in weirdo spots. It was a poor investment. On a positive note, I did buy a different wrap the Alden + Anais &#34;Easy Swaddle Blanket&#34;. Perfect Swaddle with a perfect fit. To sweeten the deal a little more...it's less expensive!"
"My baby girl had a hard time finding a pacifier that she liked besides using me as a pacifier. I saw great reviews for this product so tried it out. Definitely a hard nipple and still at 3 months old, she doesn't like it. It IS a shorter pacifier than normal, so she doesn't gag, but she doesn't like how hard it is."
"this solar light only worked for about a week.  i even changed the battery in it and it still didn't work again.  it's pretty and when the wind blows it twirls, which is nice, but i wanted a solar light.  so i don't recommend this product."
fits iphone 6 plus perfectly but one of the diamonds fell out and i keep having to use super glue about once a week because the chain of diamonds on the border keep come bf loose. very pretty but i think it should not be used as an every day case.
great set for a 3 month old baby. it assists her mom with carrying all the essentials with room for other nonsensical items.
this only fits siliskin brand cup. no one has cups that are what they call &#34;standard&#34; that would be a 2&#34; diameter cup. i didn't even bother returning it. it's just a random toy getting kicked around. it's a great idea if it had some more stretch to it and actually fit several sizes of glasses.
"i loved this walker at first and then 2 months down the line the back wheels stopped rotating.  apparently if you have animals of any sort or high pile carpet the hair gets in the rivets and there is no way to get it out.  we tried everything from tweezers to needle nose pliers but the hair was so far in there we couldn't reach it.  i called the joovy company and he suggested similar things to remove the hair and when i told him i had already tried those things he simply said &#34;sorry, i am all out of ideas...good luck&#34;.  i will not buy joovy again.  the cost was high to begin with but i was always a firm believer of  &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  not this time!  don't do it."
"love the bright colors but this mat doesn't hold up well at all.  if you have pets, expect lots of tears in your mat...my dog walks on it and it causes holes.  i've had it for 5 months or so and i can only use it one one side, if i flip it over the corners curl up because it does not lay flat.  spend the extra money and get a better one!"
my child has used this for two days and it is already coming apart at the bottom. not so great for an item that is supposed to be chewed on! complete waste of money!
"this item was damaged upon receipt. the packing material (supposed to be filled with air) was sparse and was deflated upon opening the box, which i believe resulted in the damaged product."
Handle is on backwards and the cap doesn't even stay on falls right off
"this company has discontinued all cribs and baby furniture. they no longer carry parts and accessories, such as the conversion kit for cribs. their office is unreachable by phone (i stayed on hold all day with no answer. not exaggerating. i was on hold for 8 hours. left the phone on speaker and plugged in while i went about my day.) they no longer answer emails and have not responded to 32 of 38 complaints with the better business bureau. do not give them any money."
"I don't usually write reviews but felt I ought to share my experience. I loved natursutten pacifiers because they were safe and natural and my baby also loved them. He has been using them since birth and he is now 15 months old. Today, however, I found him with pieces of broken pacifier in his hands. He had somehow split the handle part and was playing with choking hazard size pieces. This is definitely not a safe scenario. I'm planning to call natursutten but figured I should also let potential buyers know. These pacifiers are great- but if the child can break them they are very unsafe..."
nice
The pacifier itself was ok but I thought it would be personalized with baby's name but wasn't
"my daughter doesn't like this chair.  she has trouble sitting on it and standing up.  she cries when we've tried to get her to sit on it.  she is showing all of the signs of being ready to potty train, but this potty is not making her happy or making her excited to try.  we are going to have to buy another potty elsewhere."
the bed came with several missing screws that i had to go buy somewhere else to even make it safe for my child
None available.
"very disappointed with this chair!! we thought this was going to be a great chair for our nursery, unfortunately it isn't! my husband put it together and it looked great and the first time i sat in it, it was great too! after our baby arrived i took her in her room to rock her and it squeezed and knocked so loud i had to get up!! it was awful! if it wouldn't of been such a pain to take apart and expensive to ship back we would of returned this!! my husband had to spray &#34;pam&#34; cooking spray all over the bottom of the chair at the joints to help with the noise! i would recommend paying a little more money and buying from a furniture store!"
"i like the way it looks, but it stopped working almost immediately  new batteries did not help at all."
"i put this diaper on my son, and it was a snug fit.  looked good, though i was surprised by how thin it is.  two minutes later there was a puddle on the floor and a  stream down his leg.  it didn't absorb anything."
not a great buy. i don't think there is any difference between the original and deluxe. it does not provide more support. the squicky things are fun but useless as they are position too high for beeing touch by babys feet. i had to return it. it was pretty hard to put baby in and take him out.... my son is almost 5 months and didn't have fun at all. he loves the bumper jumper though....
"i was really disappointed in this item. i thought it was going to keep track not just the last time i changed my son or the last time he took a nap, but i thought it would keep how many times a day i did this. i would suggest if you have a smart phone, just get an app - which some are free - because you'll most likely have that on hand more than you have this."
this are not like mothers nipple they say they are but look close ....shipped fast and all but not what i wanted
"i sent this combo to my grand daughter for her new born twin girls. she was most delighted. it arrived on time and in perfect shape. her husband was  able to put it together very easily. as the girls out grow the(all together)  2 in one bed, i will send them another one when they move into their new home.  thank you so much as it was the perfect gift"
"this didn't perform as we had expected it to.  it's much too large to be a practical breastfeeding screen.  the color pattern is also a bit too busy and tacky.  what a shame, as we couldn't use it at all."
it is cheaply made and will be out of use the seconday day you put on your child's hand. my two year old could easily remove it from his hand.
"this product was not helpful. my daughter did not find it cute or entertaining whatsoever and thrashed away from it the same as she would a normal medicine syringe or dropper. furthermore, you need to tilt ava's trunk almost to vertical to get the liquid to come out since most of it pools in the bulb on the dropper. it took three attempts to get the baby tylenol out of the dropper and there was still quite a bit left over. while my baby hates seeing the liquid syringe that comes with the medicine, i can at least give it to her in one go and cause her less discomfort."
"I bought these to have extras on hand but these are not the same as the ones I bought from Rite-aid originally. Or the one that comes with a wubbanub. For whatever reason, my son refuses to take these, but took the wubbanub that I bought at the same time, and continues to only want the original &#34;soothie&#34; versions I got in the beginning. These seem a bit thicker and less flexible."
i have a pink make my day bib that i loooove!! when i received this one for my daughter i noticed that it did not have the make my day emblem on the front as shown in the image and it was not the same quality as the one i had bought prior. it is made of a much cheaper product and am unsatisfied. was the one that i was sent really from make my day???? their name is not shown anywhere on the bib.....
i bought this pillow cover for my snoogle pillow b/c i read reviews about it being scratchy. it was the truth and adding this case on top did not help either b/c it was just as scratchy as the pillow itself.
does not fit my crib. will only fit cribs with a straight ledge. mine curves and is thicker. underneath the canopy is stained an orange yellowish color. not worth the money at all. trying to find return instructions is the hardest thing i have had to do on here in a while.
these did not stick to my window.  i tried at least 5 times.  i think once i was able to have 1 stay for about a week.
"the fisher price version is much more interesting to my 11 month old. he never really warmed up to this one, always went back for the fp version. of course loves the real deal so i bought a $5 real remote on amazon that is all his."
"we clean everything on batteries compartment, but it doesn't work.<br /><br />not recommended!!"
"I received a completely different brand of pacifier.  I needed the kind pictured for my fussy son, and the ones shipped to me do not match what is advertised."
Not heavy enough... Doesn't stay in babys mouth.  I will be returning for the lamb one.
None available.
"The bulb on this is HUGE. My 10 month old can barely fit it in her mouth and refuses to suck on it as she does her Natursutten and Ummy pacifiers. I also hate that there's a hole inside the bulb. I thought that it would be fine, but it actually does an excellent job of retaining water after being washed/sterilized, which is really just a breeding ground for bacteria. =/ I would recommend spending an extra dollar or so and getting a different brand."
"i did a lot of research looking for an &#34;on the go&#34; changing kit with a matching bag. i was so happy to finally found one and in a color that i actually loved. but when i receive it imediatly notice that they are not the same color. the wet and dry bag is vibrant and nice like the pictures. if they didn't look different, maybe i'd not pay attention but it seems to me that one is skip hop and the other is fake. i'm extremely disappointed."
"i bought this seat because after many car seat safety reviews, it seemed the best choice and was larger than most, which was a plus for my 97th percentile baby boy. however i had to return it because it was nearly impossible to install in the rear-facing direction. i had a police officer inspect it after i installed it, and neither he nor i could get the belt to tighten it into place ( using the latch system). the final straw was the difficulty in tightening and loosening the straps across my son. i got the chicco nextfit. worth the extra money for ease of use and safety."
"I was given 2 wubbanubs as a gift for my twins, and they loved them so much I ordered 2 more. I wanted a spare for washing & in case we lost one. I ordered a giraffe & elephant to go with the frog & red dog that we already have. They arrived just the other day and I gave the giraffe to my son for the first time yesterday. Today I realized there is a tiny hole in the leg and it is leaking tiny beads. Now I'm afraid to give any of these to my children. I'm disappointed because it seemed like such a great product & the kids love them."
this chair is cheaply made. the back on ours broke. i removed fabric to see if i could fix the interior framing and found that the framing was two 3/4 inch plywood strips that were sure to break and they did. the cushions and arm paddings flattened out very soon after a year of medium usage. i expected a much higher quality of product for the price i paid.
Already the painted print is all scrached off so i wonder how much is in my babies mouth Thanks
"I wanted to love these. I wanted my baby to love these. They are lovely to look at, they feel lovely (I love the material they're made of, they feel like extra soft rubber), I love that they're natural.<br />But my son hated them. More than any other pacifier and he really wasn't too picky about pacifiers. They have a tiny little nipple and I guess he just didn't like that. He would suck on them occasionally because he was a pretty easy going baby when it came to pacifiers but once he hit two months old he stopped willingly taking them. He just loved his soothie pacifiers.<br />He currently loves to play with them as a toy. He'll hold them and gnaw on the sides or even the back looped part! He still doesn't like sucking on the nipple part though! haha"
The post said 2 packs of the pacifiers. There was only 1. But they arrived super fast! Only reason i bought them because i went to every store around me and no one had them but they are a bit high in price for 2 pacifiers.
"Neither of my babies liked these.  My toddler never liked a paci at all.  My baby only likes MAM brand.  I was hoping they would use this brand because of the wubbies, but no such luck."

"You do get what you pay for, and even though I only bought this as a gag gift for a pregnant niece, she will not be receiving it. It came in an envelope with no plastic or anything encasing it. just a pacifier in an envelope. Even that I probably could have gotten over, but it has black specks all over it that obviously don't belong. Too gross to give for even a gag."
"Clip on it not so great, falls off but I can fit 2 binkies .<br />at least I can still take more with me then I need and find them when I need them."
baby busted a seem the first night in it.  when he woke his hands were jammed up near his face.  it made me nervous to have his hands and the material stuck up near his face.
"for twenty dollars, this product is not worth it. it doesn't clean all the little pieces at all. i still have to use a baby brush and soap to scrub everything down. you are better off saving your money and buying a simple bottle brush and munchkin makes a kit with all tiny little brushes so you can get into the cracks and crevices of everything. i use the dr browns bottles and this device does not work."
"Started coming apart after only five days of use, so I returned it. For such a high price I expected a certain level of quality. The stuffing started coming out of one of the legs."
Doesn't have a quality also when I got it wasn't in original pack just in envelope with out pack but supposed to be  baby stuff needs comes with orjinal pack .i just put it in trash can when I got it .that was pice a s*** .
"I order this product because I love the skiphop brand. I have their diaper bag and thought the pacifier pocket would be great to go along with it. From day one I noticed the button on the strap was not the best and I read from the reviews other people had the same problem. But, I really wanted the product to work.... needless to say my pacifier pocket and pacifiers are somewhere in NYC."
"when i first opened this blanket (keep in mind i bought six because i have twins and if we lost one i had a backup) i thought it was amazing! so soft and silky. then i washed it. the fur matted. i thought i could live with that because it was still soft. these blankets are going in the trash. i've washed them 10+ times and they are still shedding. they leave fuzz all in their bed, their clothes, on me, in their mouth, etc. save your money and buy something else!"
"i was excited for this snack dish, but after taking it out of the packaging, i've realized ours in completely defective. if i pick up the top, the bottom falls off. if i pick up the bottom, the top falls off. it doesn't even take a slight pressure to knock the halves apart -- just gravity."
I specifically ordered these 18-36 month nuks because my nearly two year old still insists on a pacifier at bedtime.  The pacifiers that came were 0-6 months which I cannot use.
They were stiff and didn't stay in his mouth.he preferred the mam. I like the glow in the dark easy to fin pd at night.
I ordered these before my daughter was born (0-6 month size) and decided I wanted to order more because two was not enough.  I ordered them a week or so ago (same size 0-6 months) and the nipples are different sizes!  My daughter will NOT take the smaller nipples.  This is very frustrating because they are the exact same order of the exact same size!  I'm extremely frustrated because she will only take the original ones (I lost one so I'm down to one).  I'm scared to order again thinking they won't be the right size!
Our baby was born at 37 weeks and I thought these would be great. Hospitals must get these free from Avent. I was told to use all their products but they are not satisfying to newborns nor stay in their mouth more than 10 seconds. The bottles are the same---lots of hype about breastfeeding flexibility but instead give newborns so much gas they are in pain all the time.
we have this monitor for past 1.5 years and we have lived with no audio since last year. we could not find the issue and did not browse around and started to live with the video and colored signals which becomes red when my son cries. we were co sleeping with the baby. now i am putting him in his own room and having the monitor volume is very important for us. i was browsing to buy the monitor alone as i believe the camera is working perfectly. but i don't see any option to buy the monitor without camera. i would strongly not recommend this product if i have to buy the whole product for just fixing my volume issue.
"found this crib bumper too flimsy , not thick enough. not at all comparable to other bumpers that i have .certainly does not give much protection."
"the headband looks so pretty online! when i received it, the headband looked squished, and hideous. i ended up throwing it out."
"I never give my baby pacifiers before and he is now 8months. I got this because it says 3m+.while trying to place it in his mouth he just scrambled it from me and started chewing on it with his gum and giggling and muttering all.sorts of words. Buboo,baba,babadada laaa,mama,tabatabdaalaa. Lol..."
I did  not like it. Material is too hard for baby's mouth. I would not recommend it. May be cheap material
"The shape did not work for my baby at all. He much prefers the gumdrop pacifiers. We completely gave up on these after a couple of days. We did wash them in the dishwasher and they came out just fine, so that was a plus as far as cleaning goes."
"it is so difficult to open/close, i just leave the gate open and move it around to get around it.  it is made of cheap plastic and looks it.  the color isn't white or off-white but a gray so it doesn't blend in.  it's probably worth $5.  i will most likely donate it so someone else can pay that."
"okay, so we ordered this a good month before our due date and thought that was plenty of time.  this came in about 5 business days after we ordered it and it came in damaged as it weighs 97 lbs. every corner was beat to hell.  called amazon customer service and they said okay, no problem, we'll ship you out a replacement, bad news is it can't be expedited, so we waited 5 more business days, get the second one in, not damaged at all.  sounds good right?! well, as i was piecing this beast together i quickly realized that they sent 2 left sides, not one right and one left!!  called customer service again and they said okay, we'll send you out the correct piece, but guess what.... yea, it's not going to be expedited!  the company south shore is in canada so their &#34;fast&#34; shipping is 5 business days, even on a piece that they screwed up on.<br /><br />it seems like a good product from what i have put together so far but order this thing like 3 months ahead of time to save yourself the trouble of possible damaged parts and pony express shipping.  and they can't give you any updates on the shipping or status until the other department &#34;moves&#34; on the order, can't even tell if they have the part in stock, i'd like to bet that they have 2 right sides in stock!  hey-yo!  look, i know we can change our baby anywhere but we were looking forward to putting all the blankets and what not away in the drawers and cubes..."
these were rigid and uncomfortable and did not sit well on my childs neck. they were warped and i couldn't fix them after many washes and rinses. and they were big. much better suited for a toddler.
Very small thought it would be bigger it's so cute but it's as big as my finger to palm. ..
"I purchased this set on January 4, 2014 for my Grandaughter who was born on December 24, 2014, over the past two weeks she has developed an extreme amount of gas, and as I usually do when I want to make certain that I am looking at the whole scenario, I checked with Dr. Sears website to see what you should do when an infant has gas, so since the site mentioned the pacifier my daughter decided to look at the pacifiers,  both of the pacifiers have holes in them. I am contacting Amazon's customer service and the company that makes this pacifier.  I think as parents and grand parents we have to diligent and aware."
"i would not give this to my child!!  the package fell apart, i'm guessing because it was old.  the liquid had brown particles floating in it.  i did not return is because it would cost more to send back that the product cost so i threw it away."
None available.
incredibly flimsy material and terribly thin. i took it out of the package and washed them and they are already starting to unravel. waste of money!
i bought this for my toddler and he loved it.  it is a great size and not too fluffy.  then i washed it after a few days of use and it is now completely ruined.<br />the stuffing is now a hard little ball and the pillow is now completely worthless.<br />waste of money
cheap quality. not easy for baby to sleep . i like the easy instructions on how to secure into the car
"did not work on my car, once attached to the head rest, i could not orient it to face the baby. had to return it.<br />ordered the 4u2c rear facing car seat baby mirror and it works great."

Why are just two pacificers over $13???? I just assumed &#34;2-count&#34; meant that it was two packs of two given the price. I can't send them back because I needed them right away. But this was a total rip off. Order then from the other suppiers on Amazon for far less --$7-ish. Don't make the mistake I made!
"when we purchased this, there weren't many options for us. my son work up way too early and we wanted to help him stay in bed a bit longer. for the price, this product should be much, much better. the clock function is tiny and very hard to program. after about 6 months of use, it broke and we've since thrown it in the trash.<br /><br />thankfully, there have been several apps developed that work well for us. disney has one that we love using.<br /><br />don't buy this, use an app on an old iphone instead!"
"These are boys designs in the pictures,  an d I bought them for mine but then arrived some pink designs ..... My baby doesnt like them very much either."
y baby never liked these. I think the very pungent smell has something to do with it!! WOuld not buy again.
"What in the world were the manufacturers thinking when they made this product? I ordered one because I needed a paci case that was easily accessible and easy to clean. It would be great except it is impossible to open and close! After struggling with it more than a few times, it's going in the trash. When you are out and about and you need to grab the paci really fast to comfort a fussy baby, you don't have time to fight the case opening and closing it, and you don't want to break all your nails off trying."
"big letters on the box side says it works with ipod.  the truth is you need an older android phone to operate it.  once you get the right phone, then you are able to play songs from the ipod.  very deceptive, never buy erector again, got my first set 50 years ago."
"at first i liked the product, although the audio quality has always been poor鈥ut after 3 months the camera stopped working and it is useless."
"i set this up as a &#34;bathroom&#34; for puppy training. the gate is awkward to operate, might be easier on a floor inside. in a wind storm the&#34;bathroom&#34; got blown around some and the frame of the gate broke clean through in the lower right corner as seen in the picture."
"The more I thought about this product, I lost confidence it was safe for a kid/baby to place in it's mouth.  I think it was shipped from overseas, there should be some assurance as to what it is made of to make sure it is safe to be in the mouth of a baby."
"My son wouldn't take these. I paid way too much for them, AND I got pink. Wish I would have paid more attention to the colors may vary. Not ordering pacifiers online that say that ever again"
I ordered the first essential nooks in blue 4 packages and they sent me pink. What am I going to do with that for a boy.
ordered these bibs over 2 months ago and still no sign. i really love trend lab bibs but what the heck!! am i going to get the bibs once my baby does not need bibs anymore??!!??
"this may be good for someone else, but it was not good for my daughter. i ended up buying a nice one from babies r us. it wasn't as thick as i thought it would be."
i ordered the orange and green set or so i was thought.  finally after a month of waiting i received a pink set.  yeah... great job guys.
"what is shown in the pictures is sunny baby brand diapers. what i received is baby city brand. the baby city diapers are made of fabric of lower quality and sewn with less care. i am a professional seamstress who bought these to save time. i bought them on a black friday sale and thought i was getting a great deal on sunny baby diapers, but instead paid a low price for a low quality thing. because i did get what i paid for and i was in a pinch in need of diapers, i kept them. after posting this, i was refunded 50%. i have chosen to keep the one star rating, though, because i am still that dissatisfied with the product, although the seller has stood behind their guarantee. that will be reflected in my review of them. if the brands were different and the quality equal, i would have been a satisfied customer."
"i think this was quite stupid in all honesty.  sure, i could have looked at the dimensions but i thought the pictures were misleading and they could have showed a kid holding it to show the actual size.  regardless, it was cheap looking and just wasn't impressive what so ever.  will be returning."
"i cannot comment on this product because we never received it even after a month we placed the order, never had a word of apology from the seller either.<br />we have been looking forward to receiving the item for our 2year old son but ended up wasting a month waiting for nothing...<br />no idea how the product is like but the company should improve their customer service."
deeply disappointed. wanted a flannel sheet as the weather is turning cooler.  the fabric is so thin and the weave so loose that it bears no resemblance to real flannel. putting it right back in the package and returning it.  shame as the price was good. do not waste your time or money.
I'm sure my nephew would have love the pacifier but we not shipped this item. it turned out to be a clip for a pacifier instead with a barn yard theme. we wanted it for his halloween costume but didn't want to pay the the return shipping on such an inexpensive item.
this product did not really keep away the mosquitoes. i was expecting something which would save my family from becoming a backyard buffet. this product did not meet my expectations because it did not repel mosquitoes.
"never got to use it because it shrank on first wash (i washed it exactly according to instructions, gentle cycles on both wash and dryer)!"
"i so wanted to love this, but once it is wound up you get like 2 seconds of spin. it needs a damper or something to slow it down. so i would wind this thing way up to get more like 5-7 seconds of kick-ass spin. only thing is i broke the rubber bands :-( and you need a crochet hook to string a new one up(comes with 2 extra bands). i broke all three and now my 2 year old lovingly reminds me everytime she takes a bath, &#34;daddy broke it.&#34;"
"I was very upset when I received my products because even though I knew that colors may vary, the seller gave me the option among girls and boy colors... I chose boy colors then I received purple and pink pacifiers to my baby boy!!!<br />If I weren't in Brazil, I would return it!"
I had such high hopes for this pacifier after reading some of the reviews that it was good for breastfed babies. Unfortunately my son didn't like it at all. We stayed with the avent pacifiers.
i wish i could give less then 1 star.  the cable itself is fine.  the video that comes from the unit is subpar at best.  it appears to be zoomed and is not clear.  very disappointed.
"hate them but i can't find something i would like. these shells leak all the time, i use them to collect milk while nursing but normally i've somehow spilled it by the time i'm done nursing, so i end up soaked. it shouldn't have so many holes, one whole on the top to empty it (like  they used to make them long time ago) would be better."
i bought this for my neices first birthday its cheaply made very small the carriages on the sides look like pak man symbols it doesn't have a very noisy raddle im not sure if it is even going to grab her attention i wanted it to be the main gift but it so small an cheap that it seems like just an extra detail so now i have to find something els not even un a solid plastic box just that flimsy folded plastic with a crumpled bow on the top very unhappy with this purchase
"I was bummed when I received these because they were girl colors, not the colors shown in the picture. No where did I see that colors may vary so I was expecting the pacifiers in the photo. I can't really use a pink and purple paci for my son..."
this gate cannot be closed with one hand and isn't that easy to open either.  it is also very loud when opening and closing--lots of clanking and banging.  wish there was something better out there but this was really all i could find when it came to top-of-the-stairs gates.
"when i chose to purchase a toy with a giant suction cup on it, it was because i wanted that toy to stay put wherever i suctioned it.  this is removable from the suction cup so easily that my 8 month old tore it right out and tossed it to the floor.  she can also remove the suction cup.  not impressed."
"i very rarely write negative reviews, but this product warrants it.  i was sadly disappointing with the american baby company percale set in primary.  when i received the set, i noticed loose threads and exposed folded over corners on the colored squares of the comforter.  i expected a much better quality product for the price.  also, the color is neither as described or as pictured.  what appears to be a mainly greyish blue comforter turned out to be more like a cheaply done fake denim material.  the blue stripes on the top sheet were pale blue which did not match the comforter blues or the fitted sheet, which was described as \\navy\\ and was actually royal blue.  i sent the set back (amazon took care of the shipping and refund with no problems) and am making a quilt for my son's new \\big boy\\ room.  if you are looking for a fake denim looking comforter with somewhat badly sewn on squares, this would be good, but otherwise, be a bit wary."
sticks out to far and to flimsy to hold the hand held shower head.  the clamp that holds the arm of the shower held twists and let it fall out!
"i don't even think they used the right material to stick to walls. i have other decals and they went on fine, so it's not a user error. it was up about 10 min before it just peeled off the wall and fell on the floor. don't waste your money. it's just a cheap sticker."
this product is no longer available because the company decided to stop making it.  i have looked high and low and have even contacted philips about this.  i am beyond pissed because i loved the cup with the single removable handle that had the open spout.  that was the perfect cup for my 3 & 4 year old children because we spend a lot of time out of doors. now the sell this small cup with two handles that are permanently attached and a spout that has three holes poked in it.  not appropriate for even an 18 month old if you ask me.<br /><br />does anyone know of a sippy cup for 3-4 year olds that are worthy??
Before opening the package you have to make sure the soft part of the pacifier is doesn't have the classical latex light brown color (as this indicates they are not made of silicon but latex!). I didn't realize this and opened the package... my daughter doesn't like them at all (already used to silicone pacifiers).Thumbs down for Nuk here!
I have not received the order so I can't really rate it. I will have to give it at a baby shower for another child.
"One of the pacifiers, the clear part that goes into the babies mouth was completely cut in two.  Missing a large chunk.  I'd return it, but what a headache.  I ripped open the packaging never thinking they would be damaged.  As a mom, I don't have time to be running to the UPS store to send this back for a replacement."
"I would have loved to use this, but seeing as my package was marked as delivered but NO WHERE TO BE FOUND, I have to say I'm really unhappy with my purchase. Neither Amazon nor UPS are making it easy for me to find out how to get help. From what I'm seeing, I guess I won't get a refund nor a replacement. If it's a small package, no one seems to care about it getting lost!<br /><br />Just saying, BE CAREFUL about ordering something so small. I'd make sure if you buy this to get it with something else so it comes in a larger box. Thanks a lot, Amazon, for screwing this one up."
I will not recommend that it is brought off line. I spent 90 percent more ordering on line I was up set to see the same Tim at Walmart for cheaper price .
"My child is both breastfed and bottle-fed. And while I get that every baby is different, these pacifiers are poorly designed. They slide out of my child's mouth way too easily. They need to be curved to stay in. When breastfeeding the nipple is supposed to touch the roof of the baby's mouth; these pacifiers just go straight back, hence the reason they fall out constantly. Don't waste your money."
"The photo doesn't show exactly what you get,  I picked this one because I have a girl and it contained one color for girls and one for boys."
I bought the same item 2 years ago and it was much better quality.  I don't what happened but this thing is cheap and sucks my little one won't even use it
"and my dog ate the rubber part and then spit it out... that must mean something. In fact, the only cool thing about these is they glow in the dark. But, I would rather not have my daughter chew on glow in the dark stuff. That's just me. Although, they did come with covers and in a hard case so that happened to be awesome and helpful for other bubbies I purchased. Thank you Avent."
"Not a good product.  Concept Is good, but it closed on baby's fingures while holding it.  It also closed when it hit the floor which was good, however, it was hard for baby to hold onto and it would close in her hands.  Didn't hurt her, but she could not open it so she would just throw it.  Not good."
no timer no instructions just a temp knob you have to wing it and it takes too long with twins we need a warm that can heat up faster we returned it.
"i gave this chair to my daughter at her baby shower.  it sat in the nursery at her home until 5 weeks ago when she delivered, so has not been used very often.  2 weeks ago her husband was sitting in it with the baby and the whole back snapped off!  luckily, he was able to hold onto the baby and neither were injured.  my husband took a look at the chair and found that the screws that came with it were entirely too short.  he replaced them with some longer ones and we thought the problem had been resolved.  this past weekend a girlfriend of my daughter's was gliding in chair with the baby and one of the arms came loose and part of the gliding mechanism came apart.  this chair should definitely be recalled!  i would like a full refund as well.  including shipping!  one last thing.....when the chair arrived back in april, it came in a box that looked like it had been pieced together.  very tacky!  please give this matter your immediate attention.  linda egley"
I received one of these 0-3 month pacifiers in a gift set and LO loves!  Tried to order more as not sold in babies r us or target.  Received 0-6 month pacifiers instead.  They should change the listing so it reflects what they are sending.
"I had lots of hopes when I ordered this paci. However, it smells rubber so much that my baby spits it up right away."
"we used this monitor for 2 months and the handheld unit died.  won't charge or turn on and of course this happened at 9pm on a sunday night.  amazon has an awesome return policy, so i expect to get my money back for this purchase.  i had to get a new monitor at the last minute (unfortunately, not from amazon), and i upgraded to a new model from summer's infant, model: 28810.  i must say, after one night's usage, the picture quality on the new monitor is light years better then this model.  sound quality is much better as well.  although, i did just read some very negative reviews on model: 28810 on amazon.  fingers crossed."
I have had two children and neither one of my kids have liked or even accepted or taken these kinds of pacifiers. Not the brand just the style. My husband bought these not knowing. (Not having been there during the earliest months of our first.)
"after reading reviews and getting recommendations, i decided to go with the magic bumpers. however, they arrived poor packaged, extremely squished foam that looked like my husband could have cut it himself from a hardware store. the pieces didn't even match together and were a lot lower than we thought and wait, it gets worse...my daughter rolled out of bed after having them in for only 3 hours!!!!<br />my daughter isn't even a &#34;wild sleeper&#34; and we set them up with the most precautious settings, even closer than the recommended 3 inches from edge of mattress. we are just lucky that she barely scratched her chin and is not traumatized by the fall. i am returning them asap and buying big bedrails even if they are are pain to make the bed with. do not buy!!"
"I was so excited to get this. My baby is now 3 months old and starting to reach for and hold things so I thought it was going to be perfect. When I took it out of the box I WAS SHOCKED at how tiny it is. The pictures made it seem so big, but then I realized that the pictures were of newborns, not a baby that is actually interested in holding the animal. Not only is the animal tiny but the pacifier is so small too! Waste of money."

"i got this with 1 pair free for my 1month old baby one wash and lints are standing out sometimes goes into my baby's eyes.i would say i just get what i paid for,it's only 9.00 so wat would i expect."
"my daughter could not get this to work.  i tried it and it did not have a big enough hole in it.  great idea, just not a great product."
my 8 month old almost fell out of the seat after leaning sideways while strapped in.  this product does not provide sufficient lateral restraint to keep a child safe and secure.
"please save your money and buy a different pump. this pump came in a nice carrying case and had an attractive price tag. however, you get what you pay for... within a few minutes of trying to assemble the pump i quickly realized that the silicone sleeve did not fit the bottle top and therefore would not hold suction. after 20 minutes of trying to force the parts together i gave up. the product is cheap. the parts do not fit together and it is useless. go with a different brand. if i could give it zero stars i would."
"This item was on my baby registry and a friend bought the 0-3 month SOOTHIE pacifier for me.  That's what my baby likes, so I decided to order another set.  I went back to the same page that was linked to from my registry and I again ordered the 0-3 month Soothie pacifier (Amazon even said on the page that this was a repeat order from my registry).  However, I was sent the 3+ months SUPER SOOTHIE.  I just went back to look at the page and it is definitely for the 0-3 month Soothie.  There must be something messed up with Amazon's ordering system because when I click on the link to read and write reviews, it then says 3+ months, but then when I click on the link to go back to the item page, it goes back to saying 0-3 months.  Make sure when you put this in your cart that you are ordering the correct product.  I am going to return these and then go buy the pacifiers I want from a brick and mortar store so that I know I'm getting what I want.  This was very disappointing."
"When I received the package, it was neither wrapped in the original packaging nor wrapped in plastic. It was in a shipping envelope, no shipping popcorn, no shipping bubble wrap, nothing. After viewing the pacifier, it appeared as if it were used. There were scuff marks that clearly could not have come from the shipping envelope. I threw it in the trash immediately. Even if it were in plastic (not the original packaging), I would have tossed it. There's no way in the world I would have put this used looking pacifier in my babys' mouth."
"It's a cool idea...But, the darn thing keeps closing when it's in the baby's mouth.<br />Better off getting a bunch of cheap pacifiers so you always have back-up when they fall on the floor and you're not near a sink."
"i ordered this for a co-worker's baby shower. the co-worker is having a boy and the shower was race-car themed, so it seemed perfect. unfortunately, when the gift was unwrapped, the beanie and bib and shoes were all pink. it is not gender neutral and now i'm left embarrassed."
"we loved, loved, loved this glider.  my daughter fell asleep in it immediately, then lost interest, then went right back to it.  i wanted one for myself.  it's been great.  unfortunately, after having it less than 3 months, the wiring for the music stopped working.  we tried batteries, ac plug, etc., but it's the wiring. (once the music came on randomly with lots of static, and then shut off again).  i called graco.  getting hold of anyone is a challenge because their hours are limited and then they were closed additional hours for staff training.  seriously?  this is a big company.  anywho, just reached someone.  they will send me a new motor - oops, it's out of stock and will take 4-6 weeks to get in.  ok, i say, can't you send me a new one?  yes, we can send you a prepaid fed ex envelope.  that will take 7-10 business days to get to me.  then, i box up the swing and use the label (fed ex ground) to send it back.  then, they will fed ex ground a new one to me.  let's be very generous and say this will take 24 days.  in a baby's life this is a long time.  these things have a limited life to them, so not having it for 24-42 days is ridiculous for a $120 or whatever item.  super disappointed in graco and certainly will make a difference when i am weighing the purchase of a graco item over another item."
i have purchaed other advent products and had great experiences. but this was not the case with this product i'm uncertained if it's a manufactures defect because it leaks. my daughters always has spills on her blouse when ever she use it. i'm tring to wean her into cups so i thought this would be ideal but it's not effective.
"I used these pacifiers with my daughter, in blue and teal. So when I saw the same image on amazon, I didn't read the color disclaimer or negative reviews based on getting pink pacifiers. I didn't even know they came in pink. I now have a baby boy and won't be using a pink pacifier for him. And no exchanges based on color are allowed. The product is awesome! The inability to return is why I'm doing 1-star."
"It is very inaccurate. I used it for a body temperature and it read 97.9... My son was actually 101.5. I t always reads 97.9 for his temperature and my temperature. The surface temperature is also way off. The only one that is the most accurate is the room temperature. If I had the package it came in, I would return it..."
The bear is very large and does not fit a soothie. Wubbanub is a better option if your child uses a soothie.
completely leaks around the legs! returned for refund. plastic is very thin and rubber pants fit very baggy all over.
LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BUT IT NEVER MADE IT...I NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED BUT I WOUD LOVE IT HAD IT ARRIVED... THE CONSEPT OF HAVING IT
The pacifier does not remove from the lamb's mouth as it is stitched in. It would be a great product if it could be removed for washing/ sterilizing.
"My daughter will not keep this in her mouth for more than a second due to the oddly shaped nipple, which is not symmetrical an has an abrupt slope up and is about 25% fatter and longer than a typical nipple.  I tried it when she was 18 months and again at 24 months with the same result.  Also, just by squeezing the nipple, you can hear air shoot out, so crud surely gets in.  This doesn't happen with her other pacifiers."
"I wish these thing would let you put on your own paci. My daughter is only 11 weeks old and she is already set in her ways. She has the paci we have always used since she was introduced to soothers after having oral surgery. She wants no part of any other pacifier. I thought this monkey work b/c the pacifiers look similar but no luck, she won't have it. She likes to move her head a look around and she can't really do that with this pacifier(paci goes out of her mouth and she gets frustrated and cries). Most of the pictures are of sleeping babies and I guess it would work for that but my girl spits out the paci when she falls asleep so she really needs it for waking hours and this does not work for that."
"This was purchased as a gift on my sister's baby registry. The product pictured shows four pacifiers in pastel colors. While the description does say you only get two, it doesn't say they are CLEAR, not pastel-colored.<br /><br />I can't comment on the quality of the product... I just want other purchasers to know they will be receiving two clear pacifiers. The product picture is indeed misleading, and should be changed."
"it's cute, but does not stick to the tub at all. thought this brand would be good, but after reading the reviews i should have stayed away."
"our baby is 90-th percentile both in height and weight. at 9 months she barely reaches the floor when placed in this walker. only her toes are in contact with the floor.<br />in addition, i've tried to order the \\splash\\ but somehow ended with \\birdland\\ pattern. i am pretty certain what i had clicked, both are on the same web page. most likely this is a bug in the web application, but just thinking what burden it is to return it - talk to amazon support, repackage, bring to ups office, etc. i gave up and decided to use it. this was before i assembled it and found out how high it is, i will definitely return it now.<br /><br />we had a walker with our first two kids which was very nice and usable, unfortunately we gave it away to friends. i've read multiple reviews of multiple walkers and they all seem to indicate the same thing - walkers are *too high*."
"cool design, cute cup, seems sturdy, cleans well but leaks all the time...all the time. i had to throw it away. just stick with the cheap old standby of playtex sippy cups."
"the second i put this carrier on with my 30 pound daughter inside, my shoulders immediately started to hurt! i could not walk around the house for more then 30 seconds without wanting to cry. the child's weight is not evenly distributed between the hips and shoulder. you are holding their entire weight on your shoulders. it was immediately returned to amazon, which thankfully has a great return policy. if i could give the product zero stars i would."
"I just received my shipment, I truly wish that it stated somewhere that you pay nearly $15.00 for one pack. The only details it says is that the package weighs 1 lbs. Assuming you get more with that weight. Unfortunately I am stuck with it because I can not find these at the store, my daughter found it and we need it. You also do not get to choose the color, I got blue, and she prefers yellow, pink or purple. So be it. On a positive note, I got it within 2 days."
"This is a very cute pacifier holder, but not very logical. It is too heavy for a small baby and would yank the pacifier out of their mouth. I got this for my two year old. He used it to smack people with the beads. I made it into a cute key ring."
"I'm giving only one star, because my baby absolutely hates these pacifiers. They are really long, oddly shaped andhard material and I cannot understand the good reviews. I undertand that babies are different (mine likes MAM), but my experience with these pacifiers was not good and therefore won't recommend getting them."
"the switch on the side didnt work.  it wasn't as cool as it seemed from the description, but i would have kept it if it worked"
The binky main part is too big to put in my baby's mouth and the wing is to too big as well as it cover her nose. I dont use it in the end. Regret bought it.
we love this brand but these are bottles with medium flow nipples and are not suitable to newborns. they also require drop in liners by ziploc that are not sold in stores.
"i bought this hoping it would make traveling from bwi to houston easier with just me and a 2 year old. it was a nightmare. i can't really blame this strap, but it is not very long and you have to tilt the arm very far down to walk when using it so it's impossible to walk comfortably. also, in the pic it shows pushing the seat like a cart, in reality you have to drag it behind you because when you exert that much force to push suitcase, seat and child, the handle automatically slides back into the luggage. i wouldn't recommend this for anyone traveling alone. pulling that around is a job all on its own."
"I wish I had read recent reviews prior to purchasing this.  Check for yourself:  the extension does not fit!!  The male coupling of the extension belt does not seat into the female coupling of the carrier.  I bought a brand new galaxy grey ergobaby organic carrier.  Since I can't return the carrier (outside the terms of returns), I am stuck with something that won't fit.  I'm hoping a luggage repair shop or professional seamstress can help..."
i didn't like these breast pads at all compared to the avent ones. i tried them out bcuz they were cheap but they are too thin and not very absorbant. i would not reccomend. they need a new design!
one of the strings was broken right out of the box. what a merry christmas to my 14 year old son!
these bottles look like toy bottles; not what i was expecting. they are super tall and skinny- not shorter and more round as the picture makes it look. i bought this bottle because i have a very fussy baby and refuses bottles- but this does not have any vents so i am concerned that even if she did take it i would be dealing with gas/colic issues more than i already am.<br /><br />i already opened the bottle packaging- i would return if i could. i will never use these.
"My child took the newborn soothie pacifiers, so I thought these would be a good option that would eliminate the nose smushing that the big round soothie base causes. The profile of these is much better and didnt contact my child's nose, but she couldnt keep these in her mouth because the silicone on these is much stiffer than the soothie ones.<br /><br />We've kept trying these as my child has grown but even at 10 months she still prefers to play with these than to suck on them."
"i was so excited to find a pail specifically for cloth diapers that i eagerly awaited it's arrival and as soon as i opened the box my heart sunk i was so disappointed and wanted to return it. the bin is so small and i felt not at all worth the price. however, after realizing the $12 shipping cost to me would come out of my pocket, as well as the cost to send it back, it felt like i was stuck between a rock and a hard place-either pay $25 to return a $38 bucket or just keep it, so it's now sitting in it's box in a corner of the nursery.<br /><br />i looked for cloth diaper pails everythwere (online, that is) and couldn't find another that was larger and sepcifically for cloth diapers. i would recommend someone get a simple plastic bin and stick the air fresheners/filters onto the inside of the lid, it would save significant $$ and i wish i had thought to do that instead.<br /><br />currently, i have a nice big one from the gal who owns the diaper service we use (i didn't realize she was providing a pail when we ordered this one) i asked where she got it and how much it costs. found out it comes from canada and she can get one for about $40. i'm not sure of the brand or how she orders them but if i find out i'll add it to this review"
well lets start off by saying i have twin girls. i ordered 2 espresso toddler beds. we opened the first bed and put it together with out any problems. we were happy and excited to show our girls their new &#34;big girl&#34; beds. we opened the second box and whit did we find; a bright pink bed. i wish we had opened this one first. would not have even put the other one together until we could have recieved a replacement. but the kids were ready for there new beds that we had been telling them about for a week. the only thing i can say is that im glad we had two girls and not two boys or we would have had to make one of them wait.
it was a very easy grasp rattle for my four month old. the main reason i ordered it though was because it was supposed to light up. it never worked to my disappointment.
"bought this for my 10 month old and she never, ever plays with it. i keep pulling it out thinking it might interest her more as she gets older, but the opposite is true. cute to sit on a shelf but not much else."
"(teal) i stacked this item with diapers for the first time and the tie broke from the weight. very cheaply made and would not recommend to anyone. pay a little more and get a little more. however, amazon was extremely awesome when i wanted to return and credited me right away."
"in theory, this looks like it might be useful. however, the side compartments are really small. not even an average size bottle of cornstarch can fit in it. when i try go to remove something from there, like a tube of cream, the plastic side piece detaches and i have to click it back into place (all of these pieces can disconnect, which could be nice, but i found that they would disconnect when i did not want them to). the diaper areas in the front do not hold many diapers at all. the top doesn't have a non slip grip, so the box of wipes just slides all over. pain in the rear. i returned this and bought a large basket that i keep on the changing table edge and just put all my supplies into."
i bought this thinking my son would have some cups he could use to pour water around but every singe cup has holes in it. all but one of the cups has such big holes that the water doesn't stay in the cup long enough to even take out of the water before it's already leaked out. also the pieces don't snap together very well and just break apart with the slightest movement. super cute though but not cute enough to make up for the lack of usefulness.
None available.
"We do not use plastic bottles or dishes with our toddler, so I was trying to find an alternative to the standard Soothies and Gumdrops. Sadly, this was not it. Our son would not take this at all. In fact, when I first gave it to him, he laughed at it after putting itin his mouth. The nipple part is HUGE, absurdly large. After my son laughed at it, I decided to suck on it, and I don't know how a baby would ever be soothed by it. Almost choked me.<br /><br />We are now using it to wean him from pacifiers, so I guess that's a positive for this one."
very upset used pacifier!!! product came out of package with appearance of being very used realy !!! this was to be given as a gift but is clearly trash but it came in a timely manner
"The quality seems decent enough and I'm sure they are good for some kids, but our baby hates it.<br />He won't take these for even a second.."
"Although this pacifier is cheap, Do NOT waste your money! We have a hard time getting my son to take medicine so I thought this was a perfect idea... Boy, was I wrong. The nipple on this thing is soooo hard. I can't even squeeze it with my fingers.<br />I gave it to my son to &#34;try&#34; before I put any medicine in it to see if he would take to it. He grabbed it, put it in his mouth, made a crazy face, handed it right back to me and said &#34;nasssy&#34;.<br />Needless to say, It went in the garbage."
this costume runs huge and the quality is pretty lousy.  had to buy a different costume for my 6 month old
"at 8 or 9 months old, my son was strapped into this chair and threw his body forward with enough force to face plant onto a hard wooden floor with the chair on top of him.  i was able to watch it on the monitor that has replay and it was totally scarry.  avoid."
"my 16 month old just can't figure out how to use it, he is a nuk baby and love the soft spout cups but can not get a hang of this one."
too big for baby's face making it uncomfortable for her and unusable for us. clear ones worked better and she liked those more...
"The picture shows four pacifiers with four different colors. The actual product is TWO pacifiers and they are identical and clear. If you have two babies, you can't tell which pacifier is for which baby. The picture is misleading!<br /><br />Also, these pacifiers don't have holes by the nose. I have babies about 8 lbs (preemie twins now one month old) and these pacifiers cover part of their nose and make it hard for them to breathe. I don't think they're safe for smaller babies. I would advise getting ones with holes by the nose"
"bought it in april but start using it since last week, the speaker of the parent unit is not working any more. only video no sound, even the volume is turned to max."
"i was excited to find this bib for my grandson.  i thought the black background would be great for hiding the stains that normally plague baby bibs.  while that is true, i was very disappointed in the appearance of the bib after the first wash.  the decal cracked and withered."
"I bought these based on the great reviews, but they were a complete failure.  The round plastic was so big that it covered and kept bumping into my son's nose.  The more he sucked the firmer it pressed on his nose, which he hated so he constantly spit it out.  Another mom I know who likes these admits that she has to hold them in her daughter's mouth or she spits them out.  What's the point of having a pacifier if the child doesn't like it or you have to hold it in their mouth????!!!  We'll stick with the GumDrop pacifiers which have a similar material but much better shape."
the child does not perceive this as a pacifier nipple<br />perceives as a toy.<br />seems need to use just such birth.<br />to this (now) use normal nipples Avent
"I get that colors may vary. That usually means a different shade of blue. I got pink, what am I supposed to do with hot pink ones? I won't even be able to use these at all."
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! As cute as it gets, we loved it from the very beginning. But after just a few days I founD it right next to my son with the broun horne chewed off, and with stuffing coming out of it.  I was in SHOCK!! Do not even want to think what might have happend .<br />If there were 0 star rating I would have chosen it.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS TOY."
"I thought that the Wubbanub would be more weighted to help in stay in my baby's mouth, kind of like a Beanie Baby. But, it is not weighted at all and didn't do much at all to help the paci stay in my sons mouth. I returned the product."
"i did about 8 hours of research to find a reusable diaper brand that i thought would be the most cost effective, efficient and environmentally friendly. that being said i eventually settled on best bottoms but i wanted to try this brand of shell because the pattern was so cute. upon receiving the item and comparing it to the [[asin:b005bekux2 new bestbottom best bottom one size cloth diapers]]best bottom shells i already own there was absolutely no comparison. same price for both but the best bottom shell is 1,000 times better in quality. not to mention that the best bottoms have the snaps on the inside of the shell so as to allow for more variation of insert to be used. wish this review could have been more positive but save yourself the hassle and buy best bottoms."
"i bought this thinking it was one of the vanilla flavored teethers. (maybe because it clearly says vanilla in the title of this product) it definitely was not. after my first shipment was lost, the seller quickly sent out another. (although i did end up waiting twice as long)<br />i guess we can toss it in the baby bag as a 'just-in-case' toy. my daughter definitely prefers the actual sophie instead of the ring anyway.<br /><br />also i was thrilled to find this particular sophie for half the price as places such as babies r us. but the shipping cost the same amount as the product. :( which i thought seemed a little ridiculous. but i still continued with the purchase, it was still $2 less than most other sellers & chains."
"unfortunately these are the \\best\\ items sold in the usa for keeping your younglings in a \\safe\\ place.  this product is easily movable and wobbles, regardless of the shape you put it in.  the only way we were able to get it to stay still (because yes it is the best sold here in the usa) was for us to anchor it.  even then it still wobbles and moves just not as bad."
the item dimensions arent as specified.  when they are on the stairwell they can't be made tight enough even with tools to uphold consistent t usage so they slip and the gate doesnt  hold in place.  beware even though they are to protect the wood from unnecessary drilling they need to be drilled into place to stay put.  more of a hassle the. a help in the end.  we are returning these as they are not what the company claims and don't work as the company claims they will.  also be prepared to buy your own screws as they send one size and if you need smaller they tell you to buy them yourself.
The arms on the bear are too short.  The bear is also pretty fully stuffed  which means the combo of short arms and heavy bear the bear pulls the bink out rather than help it stay in.
I expected this to be more like a bottle nipple where the baby would suck the medicine out... instead it just lets the medicine drain freely into her mouth. It didn't work for us unfortunately.
"we ordered this booster and delivery was flawless, as usual with amazon. however, upon opening the product, i already felt the poor construction. i put both halves together, and could move it several inches front to back while \\locked\\. the manual stated that \\a little play was normal\\, and i could have lived with that. i couldn't get it to snap into the second position. that again i could have lived with. the major flaw, however, was that the headrest adjustment does not stay up. any movement will bring it down. video reviews only show people moving it up and down with one hand. when my daughter got in the car seat, down went the head rest. readjusted, and when she got out, same thing happened. not only is it inconvenient, it is just unsafe. if the headrest was down or went down in an accident, it could really injure the neck of the child (my daughter is 6, 52 inches with a long torso. when the headrest comes down it really hits her shoulder/neck area). what a shame, as we had a wonderful car seat ([[asin:b004ebux80 safety 1st complete air 65 protect convertible car seat, silver leaf]]) that actually protected our son during a major crash. the van was t-boned, flipped and dragged, our son didn't cry even once. the air feature really works, but it makes no sense to put a good feature on a terrible product. it is going back to amazon this week."
"at first i realized that the replacement wasn't as big as the one that the sippy cup comes with, but that didn't seem like a problem till i used it.<br /><br />what a messssss. since the diameter is smaller and doesn't match the diameter of the lid, when your child is drinking it leaks from the boarders. i just doesn't attach well. i will upload some pictures later so i can better explain myself.<br /><br />anyway, every time my son used the sippy cup with the replacements he would get entirely wet from the leaks.<br /><br />i wanted to return them, but unfortunately i didn't have the time or the energy. a total waste of money!<br /><br />fyi, i think these sippy cups are great. but since my son chews them and start leaking, it is a shame that they sell a replacement that doesn't work as one."
"well my husband is huge cowboys fan, so for our grandson these looked so cool, and we have orderd the baby bottles for him and loved them, any way back to the sippy cups, they suck. my grandson turned red trying to suck on them and then throw them, my husband tried to get juice through them,and could not get a drop, so yes they are spill proof, but also drinkable proof too. look cool but kinda useless."
This item came it was really cheezy and cheap. THe handle for the top might just break right off. Not worth $5.00 when I can pay $2 for a really good one. Also the Zebra design is very light grey.. you can hardly see it.
"I thought my daughter would love this and it would be great for night time. I don't think she has used it once, she want's nothing to do with it. It would be better if you could change the pacifier out on it."
"The giraffe it's attache to the pacifier, so every single time that you want it to wash and sterilize the pacifier (which must be A LOT if you are a clean person) you're a gonna have a wet giraffe, even when you clean the pacifier carefully... Super Unpractical"
"the first bag i took out of the box leaked. i've since been testing each bag before use. used four more, one of which also leaked. will not be buying more of these after i finish the box that was purchased."
"it has been opened before i got it,and i am very disspointed by this thing.so i hope it won't happen again."
None available.
"i bought this for our new graco element playard after reading many positive reviews on amazon.  in anticipation of our baby's arrival, i washed it so that we'd be all set.  (also, a pre-wash is recommended on the packaging).  but after following the manufacturer's washing instructions (cold wash, tumble dry low), the vinyl melted and gathered in one big spot on the back.  so now there are a bunch of holes, and the pad isn't going to stretch enough to even fit the mattress.  very disappointing.  what a waste of money!  also, as a side-note, when i tested the sizing on the pack 'n play mattress (before washing), it was too big.  i figured it'd be fine once i put a lot of effort into making sure to pull and smooth any extra material to the underside of the mattress.  and after i put a sheet over top to help hold everything in place.  (for reference, this is the playard we have: graco element pack 'n play playard with bassinet)"
"i loved this wipe warmer at first...it has a nice light. it warmed up wipes within 2 hours. the wipes were a nice temperature.  but all of the sudden, ours stopped working.  i bought a replacement moisture pad (not sure of the actual name) that goes in the bottom of the warmer and still, no luck.  what good is a $35 dollar wiper for 2 1/2 months?"
Cuts wifi voice activation doesn't work so cheap i did buy bc 100$ not even worh 40$ levana 501 the best after trying 4 monitor whit in 2 week
"Cute idea, but I didn't realize when I bought this that the pacifier is actually sewn to the stuffed animal.  I purchased it thinking I could attach my own pacifiers  to this stuffed animal, but instead it came with its own pacifier actually sewn to it.  (Thankfully it came with the same pacifier I use - [[ASIN:B0045I6IAO Philips 2 Pack AVENT Soothie Pacifier, Green, 0-3 Months]]) However, I like to boil pacifiers before initial use (can't do that here) and was hoping to be able to use the stuffed animal for different Nuk pacifiers as they wear down, etc.  Had I know that it wasn't a pacifier holder, but rather an all-in-one deal, I wouldn't have purchased this product. Bummer!"
"as many reviewers have remarked, this gate has a propensity for failing. the locking mechanism for the telescoping bar failed on the first one that i bought after 2 weeks.  wanting to believe the best, we exchanged it for another one...that quickly failed in the same way.  i admit that this is a great idea for an adjustable gate, design makes sense and it is otherwise well-conceived. if evenflo figured out how to make the locking mechanism work and not fail, i would have given it 5 stars.  problem is, it failed in the most important part that secures the gate.  this makes the gate unstable and dangerous to kids.  please do not make the same mistake that i did (twice). \\fool me once...\\"
"cheap and poor quality.  i received the bibs and the stitching is already coming off (without even using/washing it).  the backs are also made out of a cheap plastic, which i do not like.  the sayings are cute but do not buy these bibs."
"these nipples are not slow flow (\\first essential\\). they are way too fast for a newborn, or even a 4 month old baby. i'm very tired of amazon's inept product descriptions that are either wrong or misleading.<br />now i have to spend my time and gas money to take these back to ups and seal back up the package.<br />tell us exactly what the product is<br />show us the exact picture of the product<br />send us the right product"
yes they're cheap but the quality of the fabric is really poor and it does not look very good - also it is so thin that i am not sure that it would make a difference to a a cover or not - i'd rather put a towel underneath my baby - also i had purchased the la baby 4 sided pad and these covers don't fit well at all. so i had to return them.
"bag was fine when we left it at the door of the plane, when we arrived at our destination, it was outside the door of the plane busted open at the seem.  even if it didn't burst open, it is very hard to carry, a should strap would really help, not a small handle like it has"
"unfortunately i had to throw this away. i couldn't even donate it because it is a hazard.  the neck is huge, making the whole gown dangerous!  my baby is wearing 6 month clothing and this is supposedly newborn size.  last night he was wearing it and i checked on him only to find that one arm was completely out of the sleeve and had gone up through the huge neck whole. not my idea of a safe piece of clothing for baby!  into the trash it went!  i'm bummed because i love gowns and i hate wasting things, but there you have it!"
I got this as a backup for my son. He has a blue bear with brown polka dots by blanket and beyond. Loves it. Was ecstatic when I saw this online. Ordered it and was so disappointed...  His is large.  The blanket portion is big. This one was small and was like a cone so to speak... Didn't open up flat. Super cute but not the same thing.
"Have had this sound machine since my son was born 2.5 years ago. About a year ago it started acting wiggy... it wouldn't turn off with the button (have to unplug the power source from the back to turn it off) and sometimes the other buttons don't work either. I love that it has a built-in nightlight, but that has also been acting strangely - it doesn't always turn off (again, I have to unplug the power cord from the back to shut it off).<br /><br />As far as music selection goes, it's good but not great. It doesn't have that many songs on each set so it loops over and over (which, I would personally find annoying so I don't put my son through it). And there's no way (that I found) to go back or forward with the songs. My son likes one particular song and doesn't understand when I tell him we have to wait for it ... or that we can't hear it again right away.<br /><br />The nature sounds are not that great - I was hoping for a nice, calming ocean sound but there doesn't seem to be one on here. The only one that I heard was the one with the whales (which sounds too scary for a baby's room, especially when they are alone in the dark). I usually just leave it on the white noise sound.<br /><br />The sound/speakers are just okay - kind of has that hollow sound to it - so I really haven't bothered using the iPod with it.<br /><br />I think the idea is good, but the quality is not. Was tetering on whether to give it one stars or two and decided one based on quality and sound. Do yourself a favor and get a regular sound machine, Homedics makes a decent one that you can dock/play an iPod with."
"first of all they didn't send the thermometer that was shown,  and not one of the three i ordered worked.  i then ordered new batteries and replaced them and they still didn't work."
tiffany fell in love with this.it makes noise its softer to the touch.and the most important thing it blue and blue is her favorite color.
have been through 2 of these monitors now. the first one worked well for 9 months and then just quit. (note: we lived in a rural area then so it may be why it worked well for as long as it did). the second we got did not work straight out of the box. we had no picture and it would not hold a charge. will not be getting another video monitor.
None available.
only cute for a kids room. looks cheap.i wouldnt recommend this product to a friend. my husband and i didnt care for it.
"I have bought lots of the Wubbanub pacifiers, but on a recent Amazon purchase, I decided to buy ones that are called Wubbanub, but by a different manufacturer; Mary Meyer. It came, I washed it (like all others) and it fell apart when I pulled it out of the washing machine. This has never happened with the real Wubbanubs, so be cautious and buy the original."
"I bought these pacifiers because of other reviews that their babies liked the pacifier, and they were breast fed babies. My son did not like these wish i would not have purchased them. I do like the design better that the ones that you get at the hospital. My son will suck on the mam pacifiers for a while. I think it is because these have nothing for him to get latched onto and the mam pacifier kinda bows out to the sides."
"I bought this for my granddaughter and was diaappointed to find that the paci could not be removed for cleaning or changing to a different pacifier, as baby grows.The concept is great, and there  are other manufacturers who do make units where the paci can be changed out.  I wish I had done a little more research."
"I would give the Mam pacifier a 5 star, but I'm rating this particular item with 1 star couse you do get any color, bought 2 for my son and got a green set (good) and a purple set.<br />They list an Item model number that correspond to the blue one in the first picture, but you will get any. so save your time and maybe pay a bit more but buy the color you want."
"i bought this plate so that i could put messier food in front of my 10 month old that she could feed herself.  the plate arrived and was very cute, but even out of the box the suction ring was not attached well.  i hand washed both pieces and put it back together and it does not suction to anything.  i made sure that the ring was in the grooves on the plate as another reviewer mentioned, but still nothing.  i push the plate down and i can hear the air getting and voiding the suction.  so, if you are looking for a plate that will actually suction and stick, keep looking and let me know when you find it.  i will keep the plate because it is cute and she can use when she is older and will not try to pick it up.  but it is basically useless for the intended purpose."
"We got this because his paci was falling out, and he woke us up every hour to put it back in. We couldn't figure out how to get this to stay in place so he could find the nipple on his own. Maybe good if you start using it right away, instead of when they are older."
"first, the shades arrived extremely wrinkled out the package. the wrinkles greatly obstruct the view. secondly, asides from the wrinkles, the shades themselves are not see through at all. i could not see anything out the back of my car from the driver's seat and it was a bright sunny summer afternoon. not safe at all. third, the side window shades were too large for my 2011 honda civic, but fit my other compact sedan just fine. anyway, with the wrinkles and the fact that i cannot see a single thing out the rear window, this will be going back immediately!"
"this is definitely not a quality piece of furniture. i knew we were not buying top of the line, but i have purchased cheaper and more solid \\fake wood\\ pieces from target and walmart. there are scratches all over the wood, and i definitely anticipate more. unfortunately we were pressed for time, but i definitely do not recommend this piece to others."
"This product looked like a great idea, to help parents with sterilizing pacifiers that fall on the ground over and over and over. It was amazing to see the pacifier ready to use in just a few minutes. But the quality of this item is very poor! It stopped working after only a week of use, and it was already presenting some problems since day 3... My wife got really upset, and we are trying to return the item."
"My daughter loved the feel of this pacifier and did not want to part with it. I love that they are made from natural rubber. They do, however, wear out super fast. After a month of use, the loop broke and the nipple was coming apart from the ring (CHOKING HAZARD!). I would replace it each month, but soon got tired of that, especially since they are pricey. I switched to MAM pacifiers and have had no issues with durability, plus my daughter loves her MAMs, too."
"this children's toy is nostalgic and very cute. however, there is a distinct rubber smell and a very odd taste, yes i tried it, that my baby did not enjoy. also, if it is soiled it is extremely difficult to clean as the rubber is a kind of porus material and does not clean well. the final thing is the squeaking device inside which stopped working after the first couple of days. i returned this item feeling i had overpaid for a toy that was defective and did not meet my expectations. please do not be swayed by the cute packaging and hype surounding it as i was. one more thing, i was given a full refund from amazon without any problem."
I was expecting something that would be made of natural ingredients especially since it is used on something that my baby puts in her mouth.  After using a wipe I feel like I needed to rinse that off too.  Would only use wherever water is available to rinse off the residue from the wipe.
"The seller didn't comply with description , after purchasing the Hawaii Medial Gumdrop Pacifier - Newborn, Natural Scent (Pink), I realized I received the Full-term pacifier. Hope others choose another seller in if they want to receive the right product, otherwise, good luck."
"We have the tiger one and we love it.  Elephant is not attached to the pacifier at the correct angle, so you can't lay the elphant down with the pacifier in baby's mouth on the same angle.  Wish I got another tiger or a longer animal.  Won't end up using the elephant unfortunatelly, wasted our money."
Thought that they were going to be like the ones that they give you at the hospital. These were not as soft or soothie at all like the ones they have at the hospital. My baby hates them.
"When our 1st kid was born we were given the Soothie vanilla scented pacifiers by the hospital and our daughter wouldn't take any other pacifier. So, with the twins on the way I decided to get more vanilla scented pacifiers, did some looking around and recognized that gumdrops were rated pretty highly, so I bought two 5 packs. As described in other reviews,  the material (one piece) and construction are flawless.     However, the scent only lasted for about a week.  This is the reason for the one star, don't see giving the product a higher rating if it only maintains its key attribute of scent for that short of a time.    I recommend purchasing the non-scented versions of the gumdrop brand.    (We still have a soothie from 4 years ago that still maintains its scent.) My next pacifier purchase.    Hope this helps."
"My son never used these...since he is a boy and the ones I received were pink...so I can't attest to whether he liked them or not.      Maybe it's just me, but colors may vary just doesn't fly with baby stuff unless all the colors are neutral."
"watch out this product only comes with one replacement nipple. for only a few dollars more you get the actual sippy cup-much more worth the money. i thought this was a pack of three, big mistake. i was going to get two packages, but a good thing i didnt. if i had it to do again, i wouldnt have made the purchase."
"I bought one of these for our little guy since it was the same paci he had used at the hospital and it looked very cute. He really seemed to like it for the twelve hours we had it before my dog got a hold of the paci and chewed it (new mom, still learning:). To my dismay, you can't change out the paci...so you are stuck. Basically, you are paying for one REALLY expensive (albeit cute) pacifier. There are other brands out there that allow you to change out the pacifier. We returned this (excellent customer service) and bought a paci-plushi monkey and are very happy with it."
"this thing is the worst piece of junk i've ever ordered! i've put up 4 metal gates throughout the house so far, and needed 2 more, so i figured i would buy this since it's so much cheaper than the metal gates...turns out, this thing is a piece of junk. i spent over an hour, trying to get it to stay up, but each time i let go the darn thing would fall right off! it simply doesn't extend tightly against the walls like it supposed to...instructions were vague...i packed it back up and will be returning it for sure."
"I purchased this and was only able to use it for a short two weeks, until it fell off of my diaper bag and is lost already!!  Other people's reviews stated that it fell off too easily, and I should have listened.  The strap that attaches it to the diaper bag closes with a snap, which is not AT ALL strong enough.  It falls off just from brushing against it.  Otherwise, it would have been a great accessory."
"this product is great for parents who would like their kids to sleep for up to 45 minutes, then wake up. those of us who would like them to sleep a little longer wish that it wouldn't turn off after 45 minutes! i have no idea what they were thinking? some kind of ridiculous liability issue?<br /><br />this makes the cute sheep useless. i'd recommend getting a cheap radio and setting it between am stations."
"i was so excited  to pump hands free - but close inspection of the box revealed that it only works with beautiful beginnings style bra - bogus!  you need a bunch of loops in your bra, and none of my other medela bras or otherwise have them - make sure you have the right bra first!"
I bought this for my 5 week old twin boys hoping it would help them sleep but it didn't help either one.
"I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up.<br /><br />Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing."
"giant, way too big. sizing is way off. needed to be returned."
didn't work at all
not real item锛宻hipping is too slow
"terrible, leaks like crazy. only buy if your child never turns over their cup."
these nipples leaked pretty badly.
"i want to remove the sticky mark on the yellow one when i want to use it for kids. it's broken immediately. i use the blue one, the snap cannot be locked. the quality is very poor.  waste money to buy."
I could only use one of them because the other one had a hole in the tip which just caused my baby to suck in air.  I noticed another buyer had this same issue.  Not impressed!
"Um you can see inside the babies mouth, also the baby is expecting food as it is the same shape as a regular bottle nipple, babies mouth is wide open when sucking on this, I'm not saying, I'm just saying its weird and the baby didn't like it, go to Walmart and get any of the other 100 kinds, same s#!t"
"this is just a hair trimmer.  it shaves hair off, but i cannot imagine it is permanently removed."
"i can't say anything about the content, because i didn't get to look through these books or read them with my toddler. i took them out of the packaging, and got a nasty cut from the sharp edges of the pages. i'll be returning them."
Out of all the pacifiers I ordered all had holes on the end of nipple so when baby sucked she sucked air.
"hi everyone, i just want to take a moment to say that this monitor is truly a piece of garbage. do not buy this monitor. i have three children and have owned a few monitors and this one is effectively useless. seriously, it's a $150+ paperweight. the signal does not stick and we have a very small house. i've tested it and even when i have it 10 feet away with no obstructions, the signal will still go in and out. summer should be ashamed of this product. parents have way too much going on and we do not want to waste our time and money on junk like this. if this review prevents even one person from buying this device, my time will have been well spent because i will have saved someone from experiencing the pain of owning this farce of a product."
"this product is FAKE. DO NOT BUY. The package on it is fake and the stuff animal is so poorly crafted, it looks like its about to fall apart."
"we had a &#34;normal&#34; marathon 5 years ago and loved it.  this seat is impossible to &#34;easily&#34; install.  it's bulky and heavy, and impossible to clean.  i am really disappointed with the clicktight addition and wish i could have my plain britax back."
These were such a weird shape. My baby never liked them and I don't blame him.
my baby hated this thing. she was scared of the stuffed animal. however using this weaned her from the pacifier so maybe that's a good thing?!
"My son isn't a fan of this item, but he might just need to grow into it."
Made the wipes smell mildewy
dangerous  it a choking hazard  for baby's  before  you even put them on they fall apart
"i ordered the red set. i received purple and the seller says that there is nothing wrong, and that product is as described. i sent them pictures and they apparently don't see the difference between red and purple. they are literally arguing with me about the color. my butterflies look nothing like the picture, not happy at all."
"These pacifiers don't have a smooth tip like other brands, it's more textured, my baby hated it."
im not really satified with this beacuse the pacifier cant be takin out so i can wash plush it self beofre giving it to my one month old baby
"I love MAM pacifiers and have actually bought the girl astronauts twice - once after we lost an originals.  The second set to arrive, however, was not the set pictured.  :(  I'm pretty careful about checking for &#34;colors may vary&#34; or &#34;designs may vary&#34; on Amazon, but this product description doesn't say that anywhere and thought I was safe since I'd bought this exact product here before.  WRONG!  Instead of kickin' girl-affirming astronauts, I got stereotypical pink motifs you find everywhere.  VERY disappointed!"
"Worst baby item I have ever bought! It is a total waste of money. It is very hard to clean, and after first use (put banana inside it), the cloth turned dark colour and I keep trying to clean all the banana pieces out and after 4 times of washing it like a crazy mad woman, I still have pieces left. I am not going to bother with it any more and since food can stick to it that means mold will form on it even if we can't see it. If you were wondering, I did wash it right away after first use which lasted few mins because of the mess that it was creating and the baby got frustrated trying to get the mashed banana out."
"I chose the blue bottles that had the monkeys on them but I received the ones with airplanes one them, I wanted to get the ones I ordered."
"For whatever reason, of the four yellow soothies I have purchased, two had holes in the tips which made them unusable.  I have not had this trouble with green or blue soothies."
I bought this mainly for the drying feature. Disappointed to smell a gross toxic plastic chemically smell every time it dried. It made the inside of the bottles smell this way too for quite a while which made me just feel like there were little particles of chemicals or plastic that must have been stuck to the inside of the bottles. Tried running it a few times to see if it was just because it was new but the smell still stayed the same so i returned it. If it wasn't for the smell I would have liked the product.
"The pink smoothie has a hole in it, it's very troubling since the package was closed."
My daughter hated it she wouldnt take it.
Its really hard to open and close and it's made of crappy materials.  Just use a ziploc.
"I am super frustrated with these pacifiers. Its a gimic, they look exactly the same size as the 0-3 month pacies..  Need to return."
can't put too much without it actually tipping everything out of its units. poorly made. not really stable.
Our 4 month old baby prefers the Advent pacifier. We believe this one is too heavy so he always spits it out.
Flimsy hook kept coming off everything and bending. Threw it away.
"My son could not latch onto this without my finger in it. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but makes it pretty useless. He latches onto other pacifiers like a pro. Also, the few times he was able to latch for a few seconds, it looked so creepy - like silence of the lambs or something - because you just see through the hole into his mouth as he sucks in. Hard to explain but just not for us."
Very disappointing. Do NOT glow in the dark. Waste of money.
"I would not recommend this product . It came one day later which is not a problem . It is cheap looking , very low quality and very small ! Not worth the money !"
My baby did not like the pacifier shape. And the sides would irritate her cheeks. I would not recommend this to anyone.
"product had broken on/off button. motorola is aware of this problem and will not take the monitor back, instead they want you to pay $90 for an upgraded version. would not buy again."
"we love sassy spoutless cups in this house. our one year old twins won't use anything else. we have been searching for an insulated cup for them and when i saw these i knew i had to try them. sadly, they leak all over the place. i know i am putting the lids on correctly as we have other cups like this. i'm very disappointed and now on the search again."
Baby wouldn't take it because of the smell and shape
"it said 8 oz equipped with round hole medium nipple (3~6m), but received 0-3m cross cut nipple."
Don't close well
"Me too, I was expecting 4 as in the photo, tricky...and also they came in boy colors, how can I order specific colors? Need the pink and purple. They should specify."
These pacifiers are to small for the age indicated
"These need a cut out for baby's nose area. They seem uncomfortable for baby, and my baby did not take to them"
"it did not come like the picture! it's not aqua, gray and white it's all gray and white! i waited a longtime for this item and i'm very disappointed."
these cups are not spill proof.<br />try playtex
"i'm very unhappy with this stroller hook. during the first use it broke and now just hangs open and no longer latches. nothing was done to it, no excessive force used to cause this. it only had one lightweight bag on it. i do not recommend this product!"
"what seemed like a potty training essential at first now appear to be fairly useless. it will take us a millennium to go through them, i think."
"I specifically purchased these for the glow in the dark feature and they don't glow in the dark.  I returned the first set thinking I received a defective pair, but the replacement didn't glow either."
Not impressed
"I have a boy, what is the logic for receiving a girl pacifier? Well, I got fooled by the ad. Amazon needs take out this offer, it doesn't make sense."
Both tires blew after only using them a few times!
Pacifier would not stay attached to stuffed animal
They have a hole in the nipple that results in baby swallowing a ton of air.  Not sure why it was designed that way but i am definitely not using this product.  I would not recommend it.
the money is not returned
My babies did not like these.
My babies didn't like these.
very bad experience for this shopping. When I using the fan to dry up the bottles it's working on first second  then somke is coming out. If  I'm not  living in oversea I will ask for refund. I just very very unhappy with this product.
"i don't know what all the hype is about.  it's an overpriced metal baby bottle.  you obviously can't microwave it because it's metal, and it's hard to tell how much fluid you've put inside because it's not translucent, you have to look at these little notches inside."
Very disappointed with this purchase. The pacifier is sewn onto the animal so it's very hard to clean.
The butterfly version is much better. These are uncomfortable for my baby as they hit his nose. He won't use them. Order the butterfly version instead.
"recall, so returned"
Our baby does not accept it
the adhesives stuck for less than 24 hours. unless you bolt these in they are useless.
it keeps coming off
terrible! stopped working after less than a month!
I order the green pacifier and when it arrived to my house it was white and had a duck on it ?!?!? Really disappointed because I wanted the green one !
Leaves red mark on my daughter's face.
The nipple is too small for the baby to keep it in his mouth.
"I got pink ones, not purple and green as it is shown on the picture. It only bothers me because I am having a boy, so pink would have been the last choice I pick even for pacis."
The rubber part is hard as a rock and my baby never liked it
"zero stars....didnt work, total bummer don't buy."
"this is a total piece of junk.  i've only used it for about 3-4 months and the red foam broke off.  in addition, the hook shimmies itself to the side of the handles of the stroller.  awful product and poorly designed.  i thought the heart was cute but it's so not cute when it comes to functionality."
"Sent pink ones. I have a boy.Colors may vary, did not say girly binkis or boy binkies. Very unhappy. Can't use them. No contouring to them either.Like a fat fingeri n his mouth"
it was terrible. i liked the design how it cleaned nipple. however the sponge started to fall apart within a week that i was using. i had very similar one purchased from oversea and it lasted really long time. i would not buy this product again. i was trying to get hold of the company's customer service for the quality but it was impossible to reach them. it was very inexpensive nipple cleaner but i would expect it last more than a week :(
this product is so disappointing.  the clay is so messy and sticky and impossible to use.  it sticks to your hands and the plastic wrap it's in and the rolling pin.  what a waste of money!
too harsh for baby
how did you install it?! i just did and it leaks or should i say sprays everywhere! i don't want to return it but looks like i might :(
these broke almost immediately.
"just received these today & they are junk! one of the earring shafts are bent & the backs just slide up & down. defiantly not a screw on. also cheaply made, you can see a big glob of glue under the pearls where they have been glued on. very disappointed."
"horrible that these are even being sold, it should be listed as a toy hammock for a dollhouse that's the size of it!"
"I didn't actually this this. It's flimsy, thin, and does NOT appear to waterproof."
bad
these were way to small
"we were so excited to get our new car seat! we were disappointed because the shade was permanently bent. it only pulls down partially. also, the buckle gets stuck sometimes. i'm going to call customer service to see if i can exchange our seat. i felt like it was cheaply made."
"We received a fake. Not retail packaged, no FCTRY labeling on paci. Even the silicone part is slightly different than the other one we have."
too big and bulky which makes it cumbersome
too big and bulky which makes it cumbersome
It bothers the child
way too tight for our 7lb newborn. we couldn't even zip it. very disappointing since he can escape from all of the other swaddles we've tried.
taste awful gags me and makes me want to throw up.
not what i wanted
"This is extremely annoying that I had no option to choose girls or boys, I needed in a rush and the few stores around me rarely stock up on the bigger size pacis, of course I receieved GIRLS. I ripped package and really do not want to waste time returning. Wont be ordering again."
First one I received was wrong animal. Second one received was right animal but had a hole in the seam where the stuffing could come out. Decided to just get a refund. I got tired of shipping them back.
This is way to big for an infants mouth. Not a very good grasp.
Glowing only last 10 min tops. Useless after that. What are you suppose to do the rest of the &#34;night&#34;???
"I very disappointed with this pacifier. I was expecting I will get the same soft yellow soothie that came along with the Avent bottles instead I got a very hard pacifiers. I would never try giving it to my 4 months old son and hurt his palate and gums. I also tried submerging the pacifiers in a not too hot water and see if a little hardness will go away but it is still the same, waste of money."
this had to of been one of my worst purchases.. ever! this was shipped separately from the two other items I had ordered and shipping for this pacifier turned out to be double the purchase price. ridiculous. I also received it two*ish weeks later than my two other purchases. customer service from Baby Haven was the worst and this pacifier certainly is not as sparkly nor are the zebra stripes that black as it is shown in the photo. the stripes are grey and it just looks super faded.
why on earth are these made from terry cloth?
"Doesn't stay in my daughter's mouth. Covers her nose, so obstructs breathing. Don't waste your money. I bought this as it was a cheaper option to the Gumdrop brand. Should have paid the extra money to get the ones I liked. These are just going in the garbage now :("
My baby hates this.  Never used it.  Total waste of money
"WIFE: Hate these, shape of nipple is weird. Baby would/ will not take these for me."
"These have a hole in the tip which my son does not like. I thought I was ordering the same version of what he was given at the hospital and loves, but it is into."
"One star because I still love Avent pacifiers, but I was thinking that buying a &#34;glow in the dark&#34; pacifier meant it would actually glow in the dark :(."
My little guy hates this thing. It either falls out of his mouth bc it's too heavy or he yanks it out immediately.
They get all cloudy and gross looking if you wash them in the dishwasher.
"I received this set today with two pacifiers. I washed it before give it to my 5 weeks old baby boy. Guess what did I see, there is water stay in the pacifier! Is this mean this is a broken one? Or it's just a low quality pacifier? See pic I attached.I want to return it, but I already opened other bottles! Don't buy it!"
This isn't the real WubbaNub.  Don't waste your money.
One of the ears was not sewn all the way on. I trying calling to get a replacement but was never called back.
Pacifiers were not clear as pictures and described.
"i had to glue some of the baby sign back n hook baby back too,"
do not buy is please don't
"Horrible, I ordered this set specifically for the cow, it didn't come with the other 2. When I told them they said they'd reship so I let my kid have the other ones, then after they said they'd reship I get an email saying they are out of that one. I would have returned them all had I known I wouldn't get that one."
the description needs to state that the pacifier cannot be removed to be cleaned and sanitized.  total waste of money.
Gets in the baby's way and attracts any and all dust and hair which sticks to the paci
"i have had issues with the stroller shaking when i jog with it, since i bought it and even though they have replaced the frame and wheels i am still having the issue."
bad really bad product very disappointed please people do not buy this thing -5 stars.
"this is a terrible product... for a couple different reasons. first it can e so folded in the plastic bag that my husband could not shake it correctly and it stayed like an oval shape no matter what we did. also the sides seem like the baby could easily push their face against and suffocate. the material is not breathable and thick. this product seems unsafe to me, i will be giving it to my toddler for her plastic baby dolls!"
"came in on time,  that equals one star. receiving  it shattered upon arrival, no star.  i'm hoping i can gorilla glue this thing together, otherwise i have to go out and buy an expensive one."
"My baby will accept Tommy Tippy, Dr. Browns and Avent bottles. She hates these and refuses to use them. The nipples are oddly hard and inflexible."
"Its a very bad product, has a strange smell at beginning and it leave marks over my baby's mouse cause shutter is designed very tight"
Why put up a picture of boy pacifiers if it's not going to be boy pacifiers!
I was extremely disappointed when these arrived! It did say colors may vary but they should stick to gender neutral colors! I ordered these for my son and when they arrived they were both pink pacifiers! Very dissapointing!
There's a dolphin picture on the redskins label
I expected something else but ended up with this. Disappointed
this item is not sturdy enough to transport my child in her car seat!!!
"dryer sheets smell great in the box, but leave no smell at all on clothes. very disappointed and wish i didn't waste the money on 2 boxes. your regular brand name dryer sheets work better that's these expensive ones. don't waste your money."
"The paci is so big my kids hate it. Seems to take forever to take a temp, by the time it's done they are crying and it's been out of their mouth several times because of the size. I love the idea but this one isn't for us. I don't think it's returnable or I would."
the pacifier nipple is extremely hard and too hard  for a baby to use- total crap
it doesn't stick to my shower a waste of my money
The description for this Nuk says 0 to 6 mo. but it is 0 to 3 on the pkg I received today. I also ordered some 0 to 3 mos. so now I will have four alike. Not a happy camper.
sticker was mailed white u cant even see it on the wall. i guess they expect you to have black walls to see  sticker i asked for a return the emaik back said &#34;it said it was white&#34; but the sticker picture is black. how stupid is that to only sell white stickers but have a picture of a black one! dnt buy i dnt recomend at all
The thermometer no mater what pack it comes in NEVER WORKS.
broke in 2 weeks.
picture shows 3 toys disappointed at the 1 toy that showed up.... this is false advertising
"no good, was incomplete and the price is not good a lot of money for this i'm very disappointed"
ordered this and the package was opened with no nose frida inside like stated and only the 40 foam pieces...what am i suppose to do with that without the actual product?
unfortunately the reviews i read were correct.  this does not at all suction to the bottom of our tub.  it is not a completely smooth surface and this mat does nothing but float in the water.  guess we will have to try and find another use for it.
Never accurate.
I used it one time and after that it did not heat at all. Very disappointed.
it leaves marks on baby's cheek
"I bought several packages of these. Some of them have holes in the nipples and some don't. The ones that do have holes, my daughter sucks in air so I had to throw them away. I wouldn't buy them again."
Disappointing I thought this monkey would help to hold the pacifier in my babies mouth instead in makes it easier to fall out because the monkey weighs it down.
"Don't bother- this came and was already marked as low battery. I used it twice, one the day of receipt and once the day after and then it died. What a waste of my bey"
My baby didn't like these and neither did I. They are not soft and not at all like a breast latch.
The flap on the base is not wide enough to actually secure under the electronics.  Very disappointed.
These are not silicon like the ones sold in stores! They are latex!
I was SO disappointed with this product. I hadn't considered it would have been made with such low quality- especially for the price. I honestly thought it was a joke. I received a plush toy that resembles something that would come with a child's fast food meal only with a pacifier sewed into it's mouth. This product makes sanitizing the pacifier a chore and washing the plush toy separately impossible. If considering purchasing this product I suggest making your own- find a low quality stuffed animal around the size of your hand and sew a binky into it's mouth.
Very disappointed.  This is the item I ordered but not what I received.  No white polka dots and no red handle.
"Tried it with both my kids. They push it out in seconds. I was very excited about this and I realize different kids have different preferences, but mine just didn't like them. When you wash them in the dishwasher or sanitize them, the color looks very weird."
"Came late and baby won't suck on it, the end is to big"
don't like them
"Newborn and 0-3 months are not the same size. 0-3 is noticeably larger. I tried those with my 2 week old, but they were too large for him.  I was lead to believe I was ordering newborn. I did not need another set of 0-3. Very disappointed."
I was extremely disappointed with this order; these pacis are the only ones my newborn can keep in her mouth so I orders 3 pairs of them. The nipples on these pacis are NOT like the actual MAM brand nipples at all so my baby cannot use them. So irritating!
"Got two blue pacifiers, understood that colors may vary, Not thrilled with style that I've recieved."
"Too long for even a 2 month old, he's choking on it :("
I ordered a package of 4 pacis and received 2.  Not pleased.
"Had to replace the nipple as soon as I got it. The one it comes with doesn't keep suction through the tube to keep the milk flowing. Also, regardless what I did, after a few seconds the milk would stop flowing and my daughter was never able to get it started mt herself so I was always messing with it. So it was just easier to hold the bottle for her."
grated product defective
"beware of length. states 90 inches across, my fireplace is 86 inches across and it was still several inches short. i noticed this complaint on other reviews as well. can't return it because i used it."
you get what you pay for
i was very disappointed in the quality of this bag. i purchased it because it's large and matches our carseat.  i carried it less than a month and the straps started to tear. that's pretty sad when you pay so much for something.
very poor quality. broke immediately after use.
"these pull out in the diaper genie too easiliy, wasting a lot of bag."
"i searched everywhere for a car seat with a harness to accommodate my giant one year old.  he wears a 4t, but is only one so i needed a harness that would last a few years until he is old enough for a lap belt. this was one of the few i could find that didn't cost a fortune. the reviews on walmart.com were mostly positive, but i should have listened to the reviews here. after trying to tough it out and make it work for three weeks, i am forced to return it. the bottom button where the harness attaches is placed way to short on the seat. i have smashed my poor son into it, but after accidentally buckling a piece of his thigh because of the positioning (which can not be adjusted) i decided enough was enough. when i try to help by loosening the straps, it isnt safe because his torso isn't properly fitted. removing the extra cushioning didn't help either."
crappy product. both the cups leak at the rim! dont waste your money.
it pills after only a couple washes. disappointed in the quality.
"I believe the 5 star reviews are fake.  This is an awful product.  It's very hard to open and shut and the best I can do it *sort of* get it on and twisted a little bit, which isn't totally locked and therefore I can't use the plastic cap for travel since it has to be fully locked for the lid to snap on properly  The opening to the mesh is too small for a 2 inch piece of banana.  And the reviews that said it was easy to clean?  Totally fake.  It's a nightmare to clean. Yes you can take the pieces apart but getting banana out of the mesh is most certainly not easy.  You have to hand pick each little bit out of the net.  I would send this back, but I only paid a few dollars and it's not worth my hassle.  I can't compare this to other mesh feeders, as this is my first.  Surely they can't get worse!"
"I'm shopping for a pacifier for my newborn, sadly this one didn't work for her."
Sadly my baby didn't like this paci.
"Sadly, my baby did not like this paci"
"my package arrived with oil stains all over the box. my belly oil leaked at least 1/3 of the bottle because they didn't care enough to close it correctly. and it must have been old because when i bought another belly butter from target, the texture was completely different!"
"the child part of the baby monitor is no longer working, and i only used it for a few days"
The &#34;free air tunnel&#34; reduces suction so badly that the baby is unable to keep the pacifier in his mouth. The necessary vacuum is not created. The worst pacifier we have ever tried.
"box was mutilated. gate hinges were all broken, and there were half the number of panels as described and as pictures."
not working
"Its NOT gumdrop, is another brand. My newborn baby loves it but I am really disappointed"
"Didn't work for me :( considering return, so cute but my baby wakes up from the noise when I turn it on on the lowest volume"
"my baby didn't like these,  the nipple is so hard.  be uses it as a ball instead and throws it."
these tear up your doors. don't buy them.
missing brush and couple nipples
"it looks nice at the beginning, but just after a few uses the closing mechanism broke鈥?doesn麓t make any sense.  poor quality product."
"did not fit my mclaren tx. besides, next day after trying to put them on (by the instruction:, wet and and some dish soap inside) started stink terribly..."
I was not happy with the purchase. It was suposto be personalized with the name ZOEY.  No name on it.
"While I love the look of these pacifiers and my baby is very comfortable using them, their design is terrible and down right dangerous. These pacifiers cannot be thoroughly cleaned or used by a drooling baby without water/condensation/saliva getting trapped inside. There is no way to effectively dry up this water/condensation as these pacifiers do not come apart. I recently noticed black mildew growing inside all 4 of my babies Avent Translucent Orthodontic Infant Pacifiers. I have since thrown them away. There should never be holes or crevices on these pacifiers to allow for moisture to collect in areas that cannot be effectively cleaned and dried. Very disappointing."
Baby would not take because of the shape.
"Way smaller than I thought, and you can't change pacifers bc the one that came with it was sewn on! Not happy with the item considering the price, with included tax!"
"Ew.  Just Ew.  This thing looked bad, and smelled worse.  My dog even turned his nose up at it."
My daughter hated these. They have zero scent. And they are nothing like the one the hospital gives you. These are extremely stiff and not soft at all.
Does not fit the MAM brand good. Uncomfortable for my baby to use.
Tastes like rubber baby hated it! Very small ball nub to suck and hard to latch to and breath as it smashes babies nose!
it's tiny-- and looks like a toy glass. not worth the $5. i should have looked closer at the description.
i ordered the fast flow nipples but received the slow nipples.
&#34;no leak&#34; my foot. leaked like crazy. i replaced it with the take & toss for straw cups and the munchkin 360 spillproof for when i need the no-leak no-spill feature.
Didn't work accurately. Of by several degrees even if taken over and over. Returned.
Pacifier is made of really hard material.
broke within a week of purchase.
No inner packaging for item or labeling. Did not gift as intended as a result as parents likely will not accept a loose pacifier in a shipping package.
Constantly fall out the babies mouth horrible design
this is not a rattle. quality is poor. the warning link says &#34;not for children under 3 years&#34; but is targeted to infants. do yourself a favor & sew bells or other noise makers to your child's socks.
"waste of money.  if you do not have a tile shower, do not get this.  this fell several times, one of them almost hitting my 2 year old in the bath tub."
not very useful
"does not meet the standard that was describe during the purchase, highly disappointed."
"pacifier is stuck to the stuffed animal, makes sanitation a little harder"
"I ordered these in hope that they would help my newborn soothe themselves, since I heard it was so highly rated. However, I beg to differ. When I introduced him to the soothie, my newborn had it in his mouth for maybe one second and it would keep flying out of his mouth. Horrible pacifiers! They do not stay in the newborn's mouth! Definitely would not recommend anyone getting this especially if you wish to calm your wailing baby."
"What I received was totaly different from the picture. Also, the product was put in an unencapsulated plastic bag. Very very very disappointed. Damn it!"
do not stick
does not stick
we thought the ottoman rocked as well and that is what we were hoping for. it does not rock with the chair.
not what i expected. it needs to be a tad bit longer and the spoon wider and deeper. holds nothing.
very disappointed in this product. it's doesn't tighten and straps get twisted all the time ---poorly made will stick with britax for now on tried to save $ because it's used as a second seat but i am very disappointed
"gate was delivered on time, but box seemed to be opened and used. plastic zip ties were already cut, like product had been returned before. product was dusty and dirty. there were no instructions and took two hours to put up. very disappointed in amazon."
the spring got stuck after just 2 months.  terrible quality.
"don't waste your money on this monitor. it has so much static and is very annoying. i read all of the reviews and still purchased it, but now i wish that i wouldn't have."
"the mouthpiece doesn't allow sufficient space for the nose, baby can't use it."
"I also received the pacifier in the wrong color.  I didn't read over the reviews because my baby was already using this brand of pacifier, so I didn't see the trouble others had written of.  When the description said colors may vary, I was expecting it to have a different design or some other slight variation.  I was not expecting to get pink with hearts on them for my little boy.  Now it always works out that the only pacifiers I can find when I am rushing out of the house are the pink ones."
this was poorly made and I didn't even use it at the baby shower DO NOT BUY!
I didn't like the color....my baby is a boy and I recept pink and red...
baby wipes dried out quickly in this container. don't waste your money.
"every single one disintegrated within two months of use. the quality of this product is not good. if you wash it on cold and line dry, you might have more success, but who has time for that kind of work with a newborn.  it's also very difficult to scrub out the poo even when using oxyclean.  i washed in warm water and dried on low but they still failed."
i am exclusively pumping for my little one and needed a manual pump to help empty my breasts after using my electric pump. it hasn't even been a week since this arrived (used it only 4-5 times) and it has already lost suction. not worth the buy! look into another manual pump.
I've retouned.... because the screan did not work well
hello because i have delayed my article because hera thursday that it had to receive
i washed these sheets before trying to put them on the mattress and they have shrunk so much that i cannot even force them on. and now that i have washed them they cannot be returned. i am extremely disappointed that i wasted my money.
was too small for bassinet pad
useless
Can buy cheaper at walmart
not good material and the suction comes off after one wash and you can't put it back on!
"some people swear by them, some say it's a crock.  it didn't seem to make a difference on my baby."
it's just a acceptable built product.
"the kit consists of old dried out clay that cracks as it dries (even though i kept covered with damp paper towel as the kit suggests), a straw to make a hole, a dowel rod &#34;rolling pin&#34;, and a circle cookie cutter that leaves ugly edges.  what a waste of time and money. these were for my one month old baby's feet and hand prints and they came out looking cracked and of poor quality.  don't waste your money. you would have better luck making your own dough mixture."
Not the print as shown on the picture
did not work for me. wrinkles and peeling and pain in the neck
"the bear was cute, but his fuzzy hair came off on my grandsons hands. not good, since everything goes into his mouth. we were hoping the womb sounds would comfort and relax my grandson, so he would sleep better, but it didn't seem to make a difference to him. disappointed to say the least."
its not the same color it came in red color
"We just opened this item tonight and we are on the couch and our baby is chewing on the arm of her new pacifier monkey doll.<br />It was too late when we notice. She was chewing on the hand and when we took the pacifier doll off her she is chewing on something then swallowed something. When we looked on the doll's hand, it has a hole in it the beads inside falls out easily.<br /><br />Legal complain will suffice on our part. Thank you.<br /><br />Other child could have it worst because of this item."
These were nothin like the ones given in the hospital.. they were different in design and the nipple  is a lot stiffer.. my son noticed the difference right away and will not use these.. veryy unhappy with this purchase.
Way to small for my newborns mouth. Would go far enough in. She kept spitting it out and couldn't latch.
wasn't as it is shown in the picture
i can't see my baby when i use it
junky little stuffed toy.  cannot detach the pacifier
My baby did not like these. She is 6 months. Have tried several times. Threw them out. She likes wubbanubs.
Too expensive for this quality
Too heavy to keep in grandson's mouth.
Unfornatelly this item did not meet my expectation:<br /><br />I choose the pacifier for girls and i received this pacifier for boys.<br /><br />How does Amazon can help with this issue?
Worst! Dont buy. The plastic is too hard!
The letters Princess are written in grey not in black as showed at the photo
"Product states that it is a 0-6 month, product arrived and was 0-3 months. Contacted company who did not respond to my complaint."
crap broke
I was not impressed with this at all. It's so big and bulky that baby can barely get the nipple in his mouth with the case that surrounds it. Also when it falls on the floor it is supposed to snap shut so it doesn't get dirty but that doesn't always happen. I would just stick to regular binkies and clean them yourself in a close bathroom or buy the pacifier cleaning wipes.
Very bad ..the saliva got stuck inside the pacifier and I had to squeeze it out while cleaning..it went to the trash after few uses. Also I got pink and purple colors for baby boy.
"i ordered the system and a replacement.  the system had been withdrawn by the manufacturer, so that was not sent.  now i have a replacement for a system that i couldn't possibly use."
It's never arrived.I am very angry
"very disappointed. it's velcro. why is it velcro?!  a crib has bars, velcro doesn't hold and it looks funny.  needs ties instead of velcro."
not detachable.  how am i suppose to sanitize this?
"Looked way too big for my LO, he never used it."
Poorly made and stuffed- the filling was already coming out before I even gave it to the baby-/ returning it
"Very disappointed. It was not the same as pictured. For $7 I could have found something cuter locally. This was just see through pink, no glitter. And the zebra stripes are very light gray, not dark. Will not order from this company again."
My son did not like these. He had a hard time keeping them in his mouth.
Not glow in the dark (no difference from the traditional pacifie). Disappointed !
i washed this pillowcase once and it came apart at the seams. waay overpriced for the quality.
"I should have paid attention to the reviews....clear pacifiers are such a bad idea - could not find them.  Also, these pacifiers tended to have moisture trapped inside the middle part."
Didn't come with the pacifiers as indicated.
"My daughter had the lamb wubanub for a year and a half before we needed a replacement. We loved it, she loved it. It held up very well.<br />We purchased a new one for her and immediately noticed it looked like a different design from the old but figured it wouldn't be a big deal. We gave it to her and the very first nap the strings from one of the eyeballs pulled out making it look awful. Today when washing the sheets I found the ear that had gone quickly missing. I don't know what they did to cut costs but it shows big time in the end product. I used to tell everyone to buy these and they were my go-to baby shower gift but I can't do that now! I'm VERY disappointed."
"Sadly, baby hated this pacifier. I wish there was a way to attached other paci's."
came broken in the package and couldn't return it since it contained flammable liquids.
"Baby wouldn't take it at all, square tip seems strange."
Loop is very small and does not fit around stroller or infant seat handles but will work on a purse or bag. It gets dirty easily because of the material. Mine broke after 2 weeks if getting it.
This pacifier projectiles across the room. The nipple design doesn't work well for our son.
"These were terrible!! The paint started coming off right away. It only took a couple days for the Mariners symbol to ware off. Then, the binky part cut in half. Dangerous. Glad we caught it before my baby got it caught in his throat. Do not get these!"
"the colors on the picture don't represent what i got.  the quilt was actually peach, pink, and chocolate brown.  the package was sent with two valances, but the patterns weren't the same on valances.  we also didn't need the crib bumpers, which were part of the package.  the quilt didn't have a flat finish as there were strings hanging off of the quilt where the different parts were stitched together.  the quality of the product didn't correspond with the amount of money that i paid for it.  i ended up sending the set back and ordered something else."
not wide neck spouts. standard as the picture shows; wrong product description/title.
the color was wrong!
so sad...no penguins! what do i need 2 elephant cutters for?disapointing...
My 3 month old loves this so I hate to have to give it one star but I am because I am so dissapointed with the quality. We received the order on Aug 22nd so we har had it less than 2 weeks and washed it per the instructions. One of the ears is already split open and the seam running down the middle of the it I already loose. I don't want to buy another one on sheer principle but she loves it!
did nothing to help my 4 yr old to potty train. he could not tell a difference. wouldn't spent the money. just use thin diapers or train naked.
i was not satisfied because the pic shows the football pacifiers and i received basketball.  i think there should be a way to pick what you want.
it didnt cover my pack and play
hurts your back
babies can hit their heads on the door frames and injure themselves.
very very bad
These pacifiers deflated within one month of use. They are supposed to be full of air like a sealed bubble and they are now completely flat and useless.
my douther hate that...
horrible design.  very rigid and hard to collapse.  don't understand why they can't make a better product.  the concept is good however the type of hinges they use on the gates are hard to manipulate.
"I wish the pacifier I received was as vibrant looking as the picture. The sparkles are pretty much nonexistent, you need a magnifying glass to see them and the princess is written in a barely there silver tone that actually looks partially worn off... I am really sad to have to have to give my first bad review out of the many purchases I have made via Amazon. :("
Stinky materials. Sanitized according to box and they turned all spotted and looked nasty. I sent them back.
"Not a fan. As much as I wanted to love these, they're just not for us. Not only did my son hate them, they're not very solid so he can literally bend it into his mouth. It even says it on the box that this can happen and you can pull the paci out if your child is choking on it."
It is not suitable for babies who are breast fed since the shape is completely different from nipple.
"i am very disappointed!  after only wearing it for 4 hours (most of which it just dangled down in front of him) the back of the head split open where the string goes through.  it is a terrible design.  the body of the turtle is much thicker and would be a better place for the string to go through.  or they should just manufacture it with a thicker head.  i took it away to keep the string from ripping all of the way through, though there is probably no fix.  shirts are cheeper and don't get ruined in 4 hours!!!  what a waste of money!!!"
the motor that spins the projector images failed to work immediately out of the box.  i didn't realize that the pictures were dynamic until watching a review.  this pisses me off!
"I was looking for a quality paci for my baby but he hates the nipple. Even for a newborn it's way too small and pops out easily. Also when I opened the package the paci seemed to be coated in...something? Like an oil. Even after sanitizing the residue was hard to come off and reaked of rubber, definitely not something I want my son ingesting. We now exclusively use the MAM brand paci's and he prefers those nipples and they never smell or have a weird substance on them."
"Game was too small. I had to cut up the pacifiers, and it took time. Wish that the kids could have enjoyed this game, during baby shower . I would not buy again or even recommend this product for anyone."
horrible!! my son barely squeezes the bottle and it spewed everywhere!  leaks the whole time!
"it does not work. i am returing it,"
way too small but extremely soft :(
Does not look like the one shown! Not cute at all!
These were suppose to be scented and they were not.
My baby is 6 months and it is too big for her face. It hits her nose.
Binkie ripped off ducky in 3 days.
"Not good. Every time I wash this thing under running tap water, the water gets collected inside it. Very annoying to have water sitting in the little cavity when I want to use the pacifier. Now I just wipe these with the pacifier wipes, but AGAIN - washing should be the first and an easy option thou, sorry to say; with this one it isn't."
Picked boys colors and was sent pink ones
My son didn't like them. They have a scent but I'm not sure if it have them an odd flavor
"bought four of these shades only one is working and it is because i haven't tried to put it up or down, the other three came down and wouldn't go back up, i worked with them along time and can't get them to rewound so i took them off the windows."
"it's not what the reviews said...i'm not sure how it's rated #1, the bristles have already started laying down and i've only had it for 3 days."
according to the specifications online it was exactly what i needed. but when i recieved it it was too small for my sons crib
"This pacifier is funny to look at, but all the babies in our family hate it. We can't get the babies, and there are 3 babies in our family, to keep this pacifier in their mouth. Unfortunate."
Not worth the money.
"I followed the directions and my son still spit out his medicine.  The nipple of the pacifier was/hard and he hated sucking on it.  I had better results putting the medicine in a medicine syringe, pouring it into the nipple of a bottle and putting it in his mouth."
ordered the evenflo breast pump and after the third time of using it it quit working. and ordered a second one and it quit working too after the third time of using it.
"this arrived with a broken piece on the back of the monitor, so that the battery unit can't be closed and the entire system is inoperable."
poor design getting the baby in and out was a challenge and the baby didnt like it so i was unable to even use it. i definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone
"i bought the lock to secure drawers in a bathroom type cabinet.  the drawers have a double faced front which makes the distance from the lock to the front surface too long for the magnet to work, even using the metal extenders inlcuded in the kit.  didn't realize this utill i opened kit and couldn't use it.  instructions did not point out this restrictions.  i would rate the product as useless and unreliable for the design of my drawers. i have used the plastic locks that come with the kit to disable the one lock i installed."
"i was so excited for this item. i was extremely disappointed the first time i used it. and then the second and third time. it had small gaps around my nipple no matter which way i applied them. this lead to milk pooling, leaking and then making a big mess. it may have been my physical makeup but these didn't work for me no matter what i did."
"this is the second set of these i have bought, thinking the first was just defective... dummy me!<br />the monitor just blew up in my kitchen and scared me to death. it is only 2 months old!<br />soooooo disappointed in this product.<br />does anyone know where to get a reliable baby monitor with a large screen?"
"Defective product came on the back of the centipede, seamless, with failure, I have pictures if you want to send a photo!"
Doesn't even work and can't change out the pacifier which means it can't properly be disinfected. Impossible to boil or wash it.
The Wubanub had small holes in the seams and overall was put together very poorly. I was very disappointed in the quality of this item.
When I receive the packet it came with a hair. I'm dissatisfied with product I don't recommended the product to no one
"I'm only giving these 1 star due to the price. After coming across these and purchasing them, I saw them in Walgreens and the local supermarket, Publix. Both stores are usually pretty high in price when comparing to others such as Walmart or here on Amazon. Well, not this time...these are half the price at the local stores! One had the same 2 pacifiers for 5.99 and the other had them for 4.99!! CRAZY!! I will be calling Amazon next week to see what can be done about my recent purchase. I am a big Amazon fan and purchase quite a bit from them (as well as subscribe and save), so this is very disappointing."
I choose blue as in the picture<br />But I got red and this asharni malaise<br />I have a child born and preferred color blue didn't like red
"If I could return these I would, but it's been a while and it took us a little while to realize that among the dozen pacifiers floating around these were the culprits.  You'll notice right away that they are not clear translucent tips like all others.  Ok fine I thought, I'm not fussy about cosmetics.  Then I noticed that even though we were washing them, they got this kinda hazy crackled look that wasn't there before. Then finally we noticed that our son was actively rejecting these, they have the same tip shape as all the others, but somehow he knows they are wrong.  Now we've isolated the issue and these are roundly BAD.  BAD looking.  BAD according to baby.  Probably a manufacturer defect that they are trying to pawn off at a discount.<br /><br />Spend a little more and get these others from Amazon:<br />Nuk Pack of 4 Orthodontic Pacifier Bundle Pack, Boy, 0-6 Months<br /><br />Same brand, just better."
"Sorry to write a negative review, but we had no use for this item. I ordered it when my granddaughter was very small, but this giraffe is so tiny it doesn't help in anyway to keep the pacifier centered for her. She is now 7 months old, and she has never been able to use this. (it is too small of a pacifier for her now obviously or she might) She doesn't even like to play with it."
"why there is not easy &#34;handle&#34;?<br /><br />Without handle it is difficult to manipulate for both me and my child. Not practical to put it in and pull it out. The standard &#34;pacifier chains&#34; do not work with this one, you need to buy the MAM chain!<br />I do not like this obligation.<br />Result: without chain it keeps falling on the floor...<br />what a poor design!<br /><br />We turned to pacifiers made entirely of silicone (even the handle and the outside). They are super soft and flexible, easy to handle. Friends sent them to us from Italy, I do not know if they exist here. I think Chicco makes them. My baby adores them because he can chew the entire thing during teething spells."
"we bought this as an extra base for our snugride 30. the name of the base includes the 30, so i'm not sure why it didn't fit. very disappointed with this purchase."
"it's cute and my kids like it.  feels heavy and fairly durable once assembled.<br /><br />i rated it down so low due to the fact it came with no directions and broken.  not because of amazon or ups, but because the manufacturer packaging was awfully poor.  the parts are only protected my then plastic sheaves and tossed in a large box.  two of the plastic bumpers on the front and back where completely shattered and one of the wires that travel through the posts was severed.  also the foam blue and red padding has deep grooves in a bunch of places from parts resting poorly on them in the box.  there were no assembly instructions!!!  it's not the hardest thing to put together, but i'm an engineer, and tend to be capable at these types of things.<br /><br />pass on this purchase or only purchase in store."
My baby kept on gagging on these. The teat is very big! Not impressed with these pacifiers at all. Don't buy!
"I did not receive the pacifier, I received the wron product one pacifier clip for keeps the pacifier close to your baby."
I hate this thing. It is so hard to get the medicine in the chamber and when you push it down to get the air out the stuff quirts all over. Plus I needed a VERY small amount (1ml) and the smallest measurement was larger than that. Maybe better for older babies like over 1.
These are not the same as the ones from the hospitial. My baby at 4 months kept spitting these out. These are very thick. Too bad Hawaii Medical (the ones who made the hospital ones and now I think solld as Jolly Soothers) didn't trademark 'gumdrop'.
"I hope I could listen to others' reviews about its rolling problem. It is EXTREMELY HARD to steer!!! on ALL surface! And it's getting worse and worse and worse when your baby gets heavier. Besides, its basket is super small. I can only put in one diaper bag, and with some small clothing. That's it. I won't recommend this to anyone."
Do not get this one...we had to cut out top part because it left marks on baby's face under nose. Get the one that doesn't have round circle base.
"After much research, I came across the Ulubulu website that claims their pacifiers are bite-proof.<br />Since my little one is chewing holes through her pacis every day you can guess my frantic attempt to locate the most hardy and toughest pacifiers in the market. Hence Ulubulu came about. Why, the first day she used it, she bit through it. So where's the bite-proof feature?? Planning to return it to Amazon. Don't buy or waste your $$$. Besides that acclaimed feature, nothing special about it - just ordinary looking and I hate the ring handle, and the words inscribed on them - not witty in the least bit."
"i am very disappointed because this looked like the answer to my bath problems. unfortunately, water leaks through the sides and right into the eyes (no matter which way i have the visor).  i would not buy another one."
"I have never seen a pacifier as hard to use as this. First, there is no handle to hold it in place, especially when my baby keeps on fidgeting. The part to hold is no thicker than 1cm. Given my fat fingers, it was extremely difficult to use as I keep dropping it. Secondly, one has really to see which direction each flat part is facing as there is only one direction that can be fitted into the baby's mouth. Terrible structure."
"After my newborn used this paci for about 2 weeks his gum line started to form an indention. I immediately stopped using it and gave him the Avent for 0-3 months, and his gum line returned to normal in about a day. This also happened to a friends baby but they were to the point of taking him to a dentist to see what was wrong with his gum line. They were even recommended by their pediatrician to see a dentist and possibly an orthodontist."
WHAT YOU RECEIVE IS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!!! Seller says that the item used to look like this but no longer does. Now I have to pay almost the price of the item to return them. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!
"I paid for 1-3 day shiping so it would be here on time for my baby shower it's been 5 days allready  and still havent got it nor will it let me track wear its at, im verry upset with this cause this was the game my baby daddy and I both really wanted to play at our shower"
"I bought a pack of two pacifiers girl but i received boys pacifiers, blue and airplanes! That was really bad!"
very disappointment in the quality of jewelry. who goes through the trouble to monogram fake jewelry? i would have sent it back but why even go through the trouble.
this thing broke after one week of use. i do not recommend buying this. i am very disappointed with it.
this did not fit my double door fridge. way too small. it was going to cost me more to send it back and insure it than i paid for it. not happy at all
"cannot get these to stick to our windows for the life of me. they are sort of twisted, so they never lay flat on the window, and won't stick! wish i could return them."
"I ordered these because they are awesome pacifiers. What I received however is not what is pictured. The little pictures on the front were totally different. It wouldn't be that bad if they hadn't sent me a pacifier with a big heart on the front, something I would not have purposefully bought for my little boy.<br /><br />I won't order these or recommend them again because It seems to be random chance what you'll receive."
I bought this for my nephew but Had to throw this item away It had a recall on it :(
I bought bottles and received pacifiers.<br />The picture contain bottles and the title of the product is Pacifier.<br />I didnt pay attention to the title and bought based on the picture. Pacifiers were delivered.<br />Mistake of amazon.com<br /><br />Denise
"Really depends on each individual baby.  My personal experience was that she couldn't keep these in her mouth.  Similar to the Soothie style pacifier which she also finds difficult to hold on to.  For her, the Nuk is the best.<br />It really is personal preference."
The nipple part is hard and unable to be comfortable for my babies mouth. Ill return it and all I'd just like my money back
it wont stand up.. waste of money.. i dont have the box anymore but would like to return it if i could..
"received this product and baby likes it, but after attempting to sanitize and putting them into boiling water, the edges slightly melted. not happy about this."
"of thin, disposable nursing pads i've tried, i like these the least. the layers separate easily, and they bunch up. go for lansinoh brand instead."
"this necklace isn't safe for children with teeth to chew on. my son only wore this necklace once. i bought this necklace so he could have a non distracting sensory item at school to chew on, and one that hopefully isn't as noticeable as a sensory item. the teacher took it away from him, and contacted me of the choking hazard. when i saw the necklace there was huge chucks missing on both sides of the pendent. i wouldn't recommend this necklace to anyone, because it is dangerous!"
"i was supposed to receive two boy cups in a tall size; that's the specific reason that i chose to purchase this particular set. 2, 9 fluid ounce cups came, one in yellow and one in pink. very disappointed."
my toddler will not use the sassy ll cup<br />the cup does what it professes but is not enjoyable to my toddler
"i spent 320 usd and the product, doesnt work .nobody gave me a solution. neither avent philiphs. i hope that somebody fix that problem"
If I could leave 0 stars I would. They had sharp plastic mold marks.i cut myself on it.dangerous. thankfully it was me and not the baby. Plus the nipple part instantly went flat. It's garbage.do yourself a favor don't buy these.
this pink is very light and the sparkles are barley noticeable. it's supposed to be zebra strip ( black and white) but its gray and white. disappointed.
it did not work. hoping we can return it. it was a gift to my granddaughter. now my daughter must try to return it.
"i ordered these pouches in september with high hopes of getting a lot of use out of them. we used them 2-3 times for applesauce type purees and found we had to put them inside a ziploc bag to prevent leakage into lunch bags. there was a tiny gap at the end of the zipper that allowed liquids to slowly leak out. i was disappointed to have to bag them, but figured it was still better than buying the disposable pouches. after a couple of months of not using them, i tried again today and had a lunchbox full of applesauce. my daughter pulled the pouch from it's protective ziploc, but did not finish it. at some point on its way back home, the zipper on the pouch pulled away from the pouch itself, releasing all the contents into the lunch bag. we have only used the pouches about 5-10 times. unfortunately, i am a month too late to be able to return them.<br /><br />i was also disappointed to find that the back of these pouches are almost completely covered with info and instructions, instead of the cute pattern."
not only was this late but 3 were broken... took over a month and a half to get.. not happy!
"my wife purchased 2 of these gates to be used at both the top and bottom of our stairs.  when i began to assemble things it was clear to me why it had been reviewed poorly by others for the instructions.<br /><br />first of all, the instructions are not at all clear and just plain incorrect when it comes to screw hardware placement. in addition to the blatant error in directions, the manufacturer has two sets of screws paired with threaded inserts which are already screwed together.  one would expect the bolts and threaded inserts are paired with one another in the same groupings as they will be used in the gate assembly, but that's not the case per the instructions.  mind you there is little difference in the bolt sizes so keeping it straight was more tedious than necessary, it can't be more than $0.001 in cost to commonize the screws.  i can afford that convenience.<br /><br />in addition to the pain the rear stuff that can be resolved with a little reasoning one of the two units we ordered came missing component &#34;j&#34;, an upper hinge part.  the manufacturer was however kind enough to give me two component &#34;k&#34; pieces which is the upper handle section of the unit that can't be configured in any way to attach the gate to the stairs.<br /><br />now i have to contact the manufacturer and i hope the reviews about poor customer service are only a fluke...."
"bought these expensive pacifiers for the aesthetic appeal, and they sent the blue boys version. not very appealing for the girls diaper cake i was going to make!"
comes off very ez and not safe at all would never buy this again not safe for babys and kids
"beware, this chair is very horribly made!! the springs pop out of the bottom with no weight on it. when you can pop them back in they sit extremely uncomfortably!!! my bottom hurt and was numb after just 10min. thought it might just be me but my husband is a very fit guy and sat on it for a total of 15min and was complaining as well. sadly the cushions aren't well made either. would highly recommend spending a little extra money for a chair that you can actually sit in and use."
"hi everyone i would not recommend this set to any one. it's looks like a tiny peaces of the fill from the blanket comes out all the time and gets into  the child's mouth and nose. very not happy looking for something different 50$ to the garbage.<br />looks very cute on the picture, but only looks:("
"The link says it is a 13.3&#34; sleeve for Asus..when I got the sleeve in the mail, on the package it says 12&#34;<br />I wanted to return the item since it was suppose to be for 13.3&#34; and is NOT, but due to product being flammable I can no longer return the item. :(<br />I do love the color though"
This does not say colors may very!  I got green & white.  Looks orange to me!  Very disappointed once again!
Neither of our babies would take these. The tip is awkward in length and has a stuff consistency. The back is so heavy that it pull out of the baby's mouth. No wonder they're so cheap.
I ordered these pacifiers because they were different than the styles I had seen in the stores but when they arrived they were not the ones pictured they were the plain pink just like you can get any where else. I was so disappointed.
I bought these for my son and I was very disappointed when I got them! The nipple is horrible and small. The only thing nice about these pacifiers are the nice looking logo on the front. Otherwise I would not recommend these to anyone!
"it didnot arived,very un setysfied,if it will arive to my adress i wil give five stars,please give my money back"
"bought binkies for my baby BOY and they sent pink binkies. Not ok, unless I never wanted to take him out of my house in public. They should have an option for what color you want!"
"These things are so hard to open I hate it. Also you cannot fit more than one pacifier in them, I use the soothies brand. I wish they were easier to open."
"Poor quality, the colors are too faded.  Item isn't the same as on picture.  I do not recommend this item."
"the 1-star rating is due to the inability to easily adjust anything on the seat.  on the base, the recline foot does not work at all, but thankfully in it's fully extended position, it is level in our vehicle - a happy coincidence.  all moving parts on the seat and base are extremely difficult to move or adjust.<br /><br />on the positive side, i would so far give it  5 stars for safety."
"from the photos, i had presumed the diaper bag i was ordering would have been sturdy and better quality. when i order on the amazon app, it doesn't automatically show me the shipping cost, which ended up being double the cost of the bag. i really wouldn't have cared if the bag was the quality it seemed. hence my disappointment when it was received. i tried contacting the seller and was met with a rude and very uncourteous response. not even going to bother returning it for the measley $10 the bag cost. dealing with them isn't worth 10 bucks. so no. absolutely no recommendation here. poor quality. not cost effective. rude and horrible customer service. better people deserve your business."
"fake! it's just plastic beads! my poor little guy was suffering so badly! i learned my lesson, i'll buy quality next time over saving a few bucks!"
"The pacifier comes atached to the girafe. I was hoping for a pacifier holder, were I could change the pacifier and esterilise it.<br />The way it is, is impossible to esterilise the pacifier."
I was disappointed as they were pink I was expecting them to look as pictured.  Since the girl I bought it for is expecting a boy  it was dissapointing
falls of the wall useless not a good product it doesn't hold anything the minute you put something in it falls of the wall then you need to stick it again. even when you push the button.
"i do not think this necklace help at all. i bought it because my friend's kids use it and they told me it help, but my 15months old baby is still crying in pain for teethining. i didn't see any difference between wearing it or not.."
stopping working after 5 months :( worked fine up until yesterday! then it started turning on and off. disappointed in this product..
"does not fit. only has connector on one side, the other end of tube is just open tubing.  not a valid replacement part."
"i make lunch every weekday for both my son and myself.  i take this lunchbox to work, and i don't pack a light lunch.  i use reuseable containers so a lot of pyrex bowls are carried in this lunchbox, potentially filled with soup or other heavy contents.  unfortunately, the handle quickly became frayed where the rubber padded insert rubbed against the cloth.  i sewed it, but it frayed again, and eventually the handle became unuseable. although it looks like it should be durable, it isn't as durable as it should be for the price.  it'll probably be fine if you don't tend to carry heavy fruits, vegetables, and a heavy entree that might be high in water content and therefore have weight to it.  but if you want a durable lunchbox that will last, unfortunately, this isn't it."
it falls apart when my boy trys to use it and it is not well made its i would tell people not to buy it
The nipple is way too big and my breastfed baby was unable to suck on it. Also the nipple was very hard.
Sent me the wrong product. I ordered blue pacifiers for my son and received pink ones. Still sitting in box on my table.
"i have ordered a pack of muslin square cloth 2 months ago, and it was good enough. i have bought similar product more than 10 years ago in europe, so i knew what to expect.<br />but this time i received a pack of 10 squares of flimsy material that is more like cheesecloth - rather rough than soft, with ugly seams on sides. unfortunately, i have washed them before i had a chance to look closer. otherwise, i would definitely send them back. such a disappointment!"
"these cases are nice and pretty, but doesn't really work well.  the size of the case holds only 1 pacifier.  i'm not sure about other babies, but my son definitely needs more than 1 when we are on the go.  if it's design to hold only 1 pacifier, it is way too big.  if it's design to hold 2, it's way too small.<br /><br />the worse thing about it was that it's hard to open, which is extremely frustrated when you are out in the public, your baby's crying on the top his his lung, you know that the pacifier is just in the box, but you just can't get to it!!!!<br /><br />it's also hard to close.  you would've think just to snap it shut and that'll be the end of it?  no, i snap it close, heard to click, then the box open up again.  sometimes i had to do close it for 3 to 4 times before it stays close."
I bought this binky for my daughter a week after she was born and it haven't been 5 weeks yet and this binky is disgusting! It is like the rubber is melting... Will not buy again or recommend!
"we didn't realize this was a plastic bottle prior to purchasing, i would not recommend this product. this product is completely not what i expected. it leaks everywhere! it is completely not spill proof! even when you close the top it spills inside, it is an absolute disappointment from a brand i trusted"
"this crib was defective. it was assembled incorrectly by the manufacture. zero customer service support. finally on the second day of attempting to set this up, we figured out that one of the hinges was screwed in on the wrong side which is why we couldn't assemble it. this part was mounted by the manufacturer, it wasn't our error.<br /><br />we had to unscrew their mistake, drill holes on the other side where it should have been mounted, then we screwed the hinge there, and finally, it worked. assembly complete. but it was frustrating and time-consuming process. i should have sent it back, but needed it for a visit, and i was stubborn to figure out why we couldn't get the darn thing to work.<br /><br />at the price (we paid over $100), forget about this crib. i was kicking myself for buying an expensive crib thinking it would translate to quality. i was wrong."
"i thought about two stars as my son really loves these, but i hate them. they don't hold enough for a hungry 18 month old. when i try to fill them to capacity, a tablespoon of whatever i put it squeezes out when i go to close the zip seal. they do seal well- too well in fact. i ended up ripping one trying to get it open after only 2 uses. what's the point in &#34;reusable&#34; if that means only 2 or 3 times? i don't have a dishwasher and i'm not sure these really get clean in the corners especially if you fill it with a dairy based smoothie. i'll use the rest until they rip or seem kinda gross and then i'm looking for another option."
"I was really disappointed, because in the picture are bottles and the name of product are pacifier, when I bought, I did not notice the name, but only in photo.<br />I would like know why is this so?<br />Tks"
this is not a safe gate for the stairs.  i actually never used mine and had to resell it.
I received a pacifier that looked nothing like the picture. It was plain teeth holding an american flag. How is that funny? I am very disappointed that I will not be able to give this as a gift at the baby shower I am going to.
i use it for 1 month and it broke inside and on the outside for just 1 month of usage
i did not recieve what i thought i was getting!!!! the main image is what i wanted but what i got was the smaller image!!! the larger on is a better quality product while the smaller image is some bad piece of what should be called garbage!!! they both broke after 1 use and it was ridiculous
"After one use, I was unable to close both the clasps and the product was completely useless. I would not recommend this purchase."
I am just writing to say that this product never arrived to me in the pack. I am quite disappointed with the missing of this item in the pack. Really crossed with that...
"They were both pink pacifiers.  The babies are twin boys.  Of course, we wanted blue, green or a neutral color."
"This product listed is the Soothie 0-3 months, I received the 3+ month version which is much harder and my newborn hates them.  Unfortunately, since the package looks the same I didn't realize it until I already took them out, sterilized them, and let him use it.  I couldn't figure out why he kept spitting it out until I looked closer and realized it is a thicker plastic and says Super Soothie on it.  The picture of the product also shows it as 0-3m.  Very disappointed as these are hard to find locally and are they only style my son will take.  Product description and picture really should be changed to show what is really being shipped."
"so i'm an avid reader of the reviews for the products and i tend to take each one with a level of critical thinking. my wife had these bags when she got her breast pump so we decided to just buy the same ones instead of going with a different brand (even with the amount of reviews that say it leaks). well, she just did 5 bags and of the 5 bags, 3 of the bags leaked. i don't know about you but my wife takes breast milk very serious. she was very angry that the bags leaked and wasted her precious &#34;gold&#34;. of course i'm joking a little about her expression but when you have a crying baby that you need to feed and you are wasting your baby's food...it's not a joking matter. i don't know if we just got a bad batch but we had to rush and buy some from the store and so far the nuk brand is holding up after her using  7 bags. she doesn't have the convenience of attaching the bag to her pump with the attachment but the satisfaction of knowing the bags aren't going to leak is worth the extra step. good luck in your shopping! i'll update this if we have issues with the other brand."
"when i ordered this product it stated it was for all city &#34;series&#34; strollers. it is not! it does not work on the city mini! there were also pictures of the city mini being used with this adapter, which were inaccurate. when i called the company to exchange it for the correct one i spoke to a very very rude lady who refused to help me in any way! after writing a letter of complaint to the head of the company i was allowed to return the product for a refund, but i was forced to pay $14 in shipping that i did not get back! the company refused to refund me the shipping cost! horrible customer service! no one there cares to help you with issues they cause! i am still out of pocket $14 and had to buy the product i needed elsewhere! very upsetting!"
"I wish that I had paid more attention to the product description for this item. The giraffe arrived and it was teeny tiny, much smaller than I anticipated. Additionally, it reminded me of the beanie baby toys that McDonald's used to hand out with Happy Meals.<br /><br />I was so disappointed that I returned this product and instead bought the Bunnies by the Bay 'Silly Buddy' pacifier holder. It is larger, lightweight, and very soft. My daughter seems to like that it is big enough for her to hold onto, which would have been more difficult with the Wubbanub. I would recommend the Silly Buddy over the Wubbanub."
I received pink - we have a boy. You don't get to choose which I guess I should have read.
"The bottles leaked out the bottom. I thought I put them together wrong, but I didn't. Tried them all and ended up throwing them away!"
"I bought these in green, blue, and yellow. They were all fine except that the green ones said 3m+, all the others were 0-3m. My (8m old) son HATES them! He thinks he's being tricked. He looks at them, sucks once or twice, gets angry and throws them. I wish I hadn't tossed the package because even though they're only $3 I would have sent them back.<br /><br />If your baby is a fan of the soft, squishy 0-3m pacifiers then they won't like these. The 3m+ ones are very hard, they're a bit more firm than the Gumdrop ones he also dislikes."
we used this for one night and returned it since it did not work for us. the monitor has terrible reception.
Baby didnt like it. Its way too hard for her and she still likes the one for under 3 months.
"I see in the site the color blue and I received pink, and I have a boy. It was a surprise....In the site says color may be vary, but i thought that it could be boy colors, or neutral colors."
information in amazon's listing is incorrect.  this is rare in my years of amazon shopping.  listing states size as 34.2 x 17.7 x 26.3 inches.  26.3 obviously a mistake - i expected 2.6 inches but product is about 1 inch.  it is also shorter and more narrow than stated.  that makes it useless for the purpose i purchased for it as it it too short and too narrow for out bassinet.  and too thin.  so one star and )-:d.  it might have limited use as a temporary surface to avoid placing the baby on the floor or on the ground - let's see about that.  found and ordered another bassinet pad.  (-:d
"i though this would be a good alternative as we were saving for an ergo or other ssc but i hate this carrier all the way around.<br />1) i'm a plus size mommy and the waist belt barely fit around me. it was very uncomfortable.<br />2) this product is not weight safety tested!!<br />3) the straps pinched my &#34;side-boob&#34; something awful. also nearly impossible to nurse in if you have boobs bigger than a b-cup.<br />4) treads were coming apart as soon as i took it out of the package<br />5) while, i realize this was a less than $20 carrier, it is really not worth it!!<br />6) i wanted to return it as soon as i realized it did not fit me...return shipping was nearly as much as i paid for the carrier to begin with!!<br /><br />save your money...if you really want an ergo, save for an ergo!! if you want something in the same price range, check out the infantion union or mei tai..."
"Parents, if your baby likes to put their hands by their face and move their arms a lot, this probably won't work. My son pushes binkibear away and the pacifier falls out."
it just doesn't stay on when a baby pulls a door. does't stick well. waist of money. had to through it way
"My son has always hated pacifiers, but this one had to be the worst I've tried so far. Its not soft and rubbery. It's actually pretty hard. My son did not tolerate it whatsoever like he did for other pacifiers. Plus he didn't like the fact that it has a bent nipple. I was dumb to think he'd actually like it when a mother's nipple as well as bottle nipples have a full form. Which my son preferred. Avent soothie was definitely better."
The pacifier was not even sewn onto the Elephant..really dissapointed with the quality! I paid $15.00...I should have gone to a<br />Baby Store!
"It was denied to enter Mexico due to material m,ade off so i really was disappointed I could not provide my grand doughter with such item"
"what i got was just a throw, doesn't resemble the picture at all. no pillow, the picture on the throw isn't even the same. where's the set? sooooo disappointed, especially for the price. if your sending just a throw, say it's a throw, not a set that's not a set."
"i bought this to protect my baby from the edges of my table, but it didn't stick! i had to remove it and toss it, for me it was a waste of money!"
"the inside lining of the bag started coming apart at the seams after two weeks and the bag began leaking. further use showed that the interior lining was continuing to disintegrate and tearing to pieces. the only thing being carried was formula bottles, so this was not due to what we were using it for. bottom line: the quality of this product is poor and it won't last you a month before you are buying a replacement."
"The spring doesnot retract and dont recommend at all!!!  Was disappointed having wasted time in ordering,fixing and returning the item."
The product was smaller than what I expected and looked cheap was not worth the price.  Very disappointed specially because it was a gift
The description was not clear enough to know this was a pacifier for newborns.  I was looking for a specific size and shape and had to take a gamble to see if it was what I was looking for.  I lost and wasted my money from my perspective.
We understand that the listing specifies colors vary but we thought they'd at least be neutral colors.  We received two hot pink pacifiers for a boy.  It really isn't that hard to create multiple listings for the various colors.  Shame on us for believing that the colors shown might be the colors delivered.  Do not buy from seller until they fix the listings.
My daughter loves these pacifiers in the 0 month size. The 3 month size are so thick she can't even keep them in her mouth when she's sucking. They aren't pliable at all and they're completely unusable for us.
"i really wanted to like this, but it was always falling off, making the thing pointless.  will now have to look for something more expensive that actually does the job."
"i got these cups for my 2yr old to use. i was very disappointed with this product. the lid does not twist on very well, and they leak like crazy, not through the spout, but through where the lid threads to the cup. every time my daughter went to take a drink from the cup it would drip down the front of her.<br /><br />i was also disappointed with the quality of the cups, they are not much thicker than throw away plastic party cups.<br /><br />i definitely will not be buying this product again!"
So sad that this WubbaNub is useless for us.  Our older daughter has had the Clifford one since she was a newborn and it was wonderful so we bought this one for baby #2.  It is useless though!  It has no weight to it so it doesn't stay in her mouth or on her chest and instead she pushes it out with every movement of her hands.  It stays in LESS than a regular pacifier.  Boo!  A friend is giving us the lamb and I hope that one is better.
"I could have gotten this stuffed bear from the dollar store! its not soft at all, overstuffed so my child cannot even use it, and the material is so awful and cheaply made that it already has a hole in it. don't waste your money."
"i bought 3 of these latches but they are completely unuseful for the type of cabinets i have at home so basically i wasted my money because i cant use them!! the knobs in my kitchen cabinets are too wide (they are rectangular) and so the latch is not large enough to cover them, therefore it is impossible to use them. i even tried cutting them but it did not work either. waste of money! i cant even use them in other parts of my house!"
I received this item in blue color - it's different from the image they have on the image. I was expecting yellow ones. Had to return it.
fell apart had to return<br />do not buy this<br />went to use and the joints came apart<br />glad granddaughter was not inside
i expected a cover that protected the babies bottom.  something that i could use on vacatton. this was a total waste of my money and time. this makes me  very leary of ordering on line.
"I had high hopes that my daughter was going to latch on this product thinking it is the same product produced by Hawaii Medical... Turns out it is not, as I clearly see now by Tomy.<br /><br />It did work for my baby! Cute colors but I must say for a breastfed baby it is too glossy abit hard and very fake!"
We bought two so wasted $30  We should have sent them back but just threw away after cutting off the pacifiers. I can't understand why any good reviews unless parents are stitching them up. I wouldn't take a chance on choking hazard as you would have to inspect after each wash and sew open seams? I don't have time for that. I really wanted to like them. I wish I had bought one. I hate throwing money away. One bad thing about buying online. If something goes bad you have to take the time to send back
"this is not a perfect fit for the graco pack n play!! the corners of this mattress sticks out and is very dangerous for your baby to sit & stand.  please do not buy this, i really want to return this item but i already threw away the packaging materials..there's my $$$ down the drain.."
"I love these pacifiers- they're the only ones my son will take.  However, I ordered a 4 pack of the 3+ month and received a single newborn size pacifier.  Very disappointing."
"they sent me the smallest size,my 12 y.o. daughter cant even wear this thing.and why is it so expensive??all it is is a piece of fabric.i know i ordered small,my wife is small,but she cant use this thing as a headband....."
"binky is the only pacifier my baby ever took, except this one, no good grip and slips out easily, the plastic is too strong and it smells like crude oil"
"total useless, wasted time and money,no changes at all and they are so uncomfortable,restricted from using them for any length of time."
"we bought this car seat for travel (airport compliant and folding compact for travel).  this seat is very heavy, difficult to install, has many sharp edges, and the restraint system is awkward to adjust and release.  for the price there are better options. not recommended."
"i thought this would be an amazing product. sadly very wrong. it works ok as a seat to put over a toilet seat i guess, but to use as a standing potty for emergencys a solid no! i tried to use this in my suv at the fireworks for my son to use, but the second he would sit on it it would collapse. so flimsy! not to mention if you have a boy there is not pee guard. very disappointed."
"I was desperately looking for solution to the pacifier always falling out of my 2 month old baby's mouth making him cry hysterically particularly when I'm driving. I read reviews and thought this product would be a lifesaver but I was so disappointed. First, the pacifier that comes with the toy is flimsy, it's not the same quality as the actually one that you buy separately. Also, the way it is sewn on to the mouth of the toy, it pulls the pacifier out of the baby's mouth making it even more difficult for the baby to hang on to it then if it was just a pacifier without the toy. I waited by the door to receive this and unfortunately it was a huge waste. Going back to holding the pacifier in myself."
the brush worked fine the first 2 weeks but then individual plastic strands started to deteriorate and tangle up. after about 6 weeks the brush had literally turned into a hairball of plastic and was tossed into the trash. bad product.
i was very careful to check for regular single bed sheets; this one fooled me... shame on me and them!
I specifically paid the difference to get the pink elephant wubbanub. Instead I received the plain gray elephant wubbanub with a sticker on the back of the package that says Mary Meyer Ella Bella Elephant wubbanub. Very disappointed. The packaging it came in didn't have any return labels or anything as well. Too late to get it in time for Christmas anyways..
"I was expecting to receive a pack of blue pacifiers, and instead I received PINK! I will not use a pink pacifier on my baby BOY! False advertising!"
Before buying this particular one I asked if it was the bigger one not the newborn and was told yes buy a fellow customer who had purchased these... Sadly it was the smaller one and my son who is almost 13 months wont take it cause its to small. Last time I ever shop on line like this...
this is not worth it if you have any wind in your neighborhood. it does not have any weight to it and will simply blow down the street with any degree of wind. not worth it unless you get a 5 lb weight to hold it down.
"difficult to use, does not always work. disconnects automatically. way over priced and over promised. customer service is slow to respond."
Picture showed blue and green camo but what arrived was pink and purple. Not sure about a pink camo pacifier for my son. All it says is colors vary.
Money wasted. I bought 4. The pink one is hard to find too so she's stuck on the green ones.
"I use soap when washing pacifiers and the rest of the baby products. If you use soap on this particular pacifier, you can't wash it out. Any way you try to turn the pacifier to get the water stream to wash out the soap, the soap is unable to completely escape. We are back to using regular soothies."
"this product doesn't do what it supposed to. the pacifier is bigger and havier than the toy's head so it falls down, the toy is useless.so expensive.waste of money"
"I am not sure if it's the shape or the larger size, but my baby just doesn't like it and prefers advent soothies that she got at the hospital. It also changes color a bit once it is sterilized ... so seems weird that it would."
this product was sooooooo bad. water went to my daughter's eyes and she cried. it was our first time try. you shouldn't waste your money for this.
this pouch is not needed - you can barely see it on the side of the britax marathon car seat. i feel it was a waste of $.
"i should have read the other reviews ... this duck doesn't stay upright.  seriously, what's the point of having a duck if it can only lay on it's side????"
"i purchased this gate to put at the top of my stairs, which are 34\\ wide.  since this products states that it fits doorways that are 29-40\\ wide, i figured, \\no problem!\\  wrong!  the 34\\ is just a bit too narrow to use the extension for the gate, so i had to extend the screws fully out from the gate to make it fit (about 4-5\\ of screw on each side).  this made the gate incredibly flimsy and shaky.  i am returning the gate, which is frustrating after putting 4 holes in my wall!"
this product never got to my house it has been a month and i have contacted them twice it shows it sitting somewhere in wisconsin. and they won't do anything about it!!
"i would like to warn everyone about this company:  i ordered new hello kitty core front window fold up sunshade for $21.26 and this item has the hello kitty sitting down waving and the big hello kelly sign and the color of shade is pink , light pink.<br /><br />when i received the item it is red and it is totally different and it has hello kitty standing up,,,, obviously not the same item i ordered!<br /><br />i should have read the review before i ordered the item, this company is a con!!!!!<br />someone had similar problem and i should have read it!!!<br /><br />my mistake for not reading review!!<br /><br />if i can give a 0 star i would but it let me select 1 for i hate it!! star<br /><br />i do not want any problems so i decided to keep it, even though i received the wrong item!!!!!!<br /><br />bad seller!  warning before u purchase here  !!! warning!!!"
I was pretty disappointed at how breakable this is. It seems very flimsy and for the price I was not impressed at all. Wish I hadn't of purchased it.
Very unhappy with the quality of this bear.  Every time it is touched fur comes off in clumps.  The auto off function does not work.  The eyes are not safe for babies and could be pulled off.  This item is not safe for to have around a baby!
"Omg! Why was it dirty??? I couldn't believe it looked so funky! And, it really didn't look anything like the picture. Very disappointing. It's not even worth trying to return it...I wish I could give NO stars!"
My Son hated these from the start.  I think its one of those things you are going to get different opinions from because not all babies like the same things.
We purchased 2 separate wubbanubs and were dissatisfied with both of them.  They both began popping seams and stuffing coming out of them within the first 3 weeks.  Out child was 3 weeks old and obviously not harming them in any way... just poor poor quality! Then when contacting the company and dealing with them they sent another... which has ZERO stuffing in it... they asked to send us another but after 3 out of 4 wubbanubs being broken we had had enough!
"before buying this product i've read the reviews.<br />i've read several which suggested serious manufacture problems but thought to myself - \\amazon wouldn't sell it if it doesn't work... and it will probably won't happen to me\\.<br />well i was wrong - i got the two parental units version, and both do not charge. i've tried switching outlets, chargers, shaking it and praying, but it just wouldn't charge.<br /><br />don't make my mistake - go with a higher rated product, even if it costs you a few bucks more.<br />otherwise, it will cost you a definite 50 bucks more!!"
"I ordered this binky for my daughter and when you wash it, the color of the binky fades and it becomes quite fuzzy.  I also ordered the monkey one and don't seem to have any problems with that one.  I would not order this particular one because of the poor quality of the product."
"i am really disappointed with this wet bag. the bag doesn't keep the moisture in. i put a soiled diaper in the bag, zipped it up and placed it in my diaper bag. i later returned to find that my clean diapers were damp from placing the bag on top of them. i have to place a plastic bag around the outside so nothing else will get wet. had i known this about the bag i would not have purchased."
"the color is great, the material is super soft & washes well. . however, the elastic gives out making the sheet useless! i would not recommend that anyone buy this. loose bedding in a crib is very dangerous, carters needs to change the elastic used in making these sheets."
there is a hard plastic board on the back of the seat padding which is not safe for children who like to rest their heads on it. my baby had a cut on the back of her head when she turned from one direction to another. the plastic board is sharp enough to cut the skin as the fabric of the seat padding is thin.
"I know it says colors and designs may vary, but I assumed since solid colors are pictured I was going to get solid pacifiers..."
i returned this item the same day it arrived.  one other review stated that it looked like it came from the dollar store and i would have to agree. it has a space for a plug for a/c power but no adapter was included and it was not compatible with any adapter i had.
"I ordered the cutsie caterpillar and got a monkey instead, and when I tried to return it, the site said they were out of stock... Be cautions when ordering"
"i ordered this mirror thinking i could use it with a rear view mirror to see my son while driving in the car, but it's not a real mirror... it's like a fun house mirror in a haunted house or something. it's actually a bit scary for him because nothing is recognizable. also, the stand is flimsy, and the straps are too, making it hard to even use it if you wanted to. i'm returning it."
"i got the woombie to replace a miracle blanket, which my 3-month-old daughter is growing out of (and which comes only in newborn - 3 month size).  i was so hoping it'll work, but it didn't.  it just got my baby frustrated - she could move her arms, got her hands close to her mouth, but couldn't get them into her mouth (besides, i think her arms got stuck in this position, and she couldn't move them down).  the miracle blanket uses two levels of restraint - first the arms get pinned down alongside the body, then the baby is wrapped all around.  no moving arms there.  my daughter loves this blanket, frequently falls asleep on her own (some times after 5 min of fussing, sometimes right away) if wakes she up while i put her down, and always falls back asleep if she wakes up in the middle of the night or a nap.  with the woombie, she started whimpering when i put her down and the whimpers quickly turned into crying, as she was trying to get her arms somewhere, where they wanted to go.  this swaddling blanket is supposed to mimic the womb.  well, maybe if you start using it on a newborn and then graduate to the larger side it would work.  but by 3 months, perhaps, the womb experience is too remote for the baby to need to replicate it."
"maybe it is because i didn't read the manual, but this car seat is hard to get out of the car!  it requires two hands to unlock it and then the baby gets jerked from the movement.  would not buy this product again because of that."
"i fell in love with the boutique look of these cloth diapers when i first saw them. i also liked how they were a bit narrower than the bum genius diapers since my daughter is tiny. however, after using these for a few months... they are worthless. the outer material absorbs the urine as soon as it wets the liner. my daughter had wet pants after 45 minutes of wearing these diapers yesterday. these are now the diapers i only wear on her around the house, knowing they probably wont last longer than an hour :("
I ordered these pacifiers for a baby boy and I ended up getting pink color pacifiers. I was really disappointed when I opened the package. There is no way I can use this pacifiers. I really wish there was an option to choose color. As it is a complete waste of money to buy a product which I'm never gonna use.
"unfortunately, you can't choose to get a foot or a hand. they assign it to the customer randomly. however, there are real differences. the hand has fingers wide enough apart that a baby can stick a finger in his  mouth. the foot has no separation between digits. it is one big clump. very difficult for baby to put in mouth and not too comfy once there."
i bought this for my daughter and it was terrible. it leaks from the bottom as if it its missing a piece and came with no instructions of how to assemble.
"In contrast to the good reviews here, my 4 month old daugther refuses it<br />because of its disgusting smell.<br />For a first couple of weeks, it was good. However, after that it smells like feet :("
"i was very interested in this item, and ordered 2. today, when i got them, they did not have the on/off switch, they were just 2 plain usb 2gb sticks. i was very disappointed."
"this bear was so disappointing!! we have a bigger bear and love it. it's stood up awesome to 4 years of play with no issues at all. we had this new bear less than a month - and mostly ignored and unplayed with the entire time - and one of the paws has ripped where the satin part meets the \\fur\\ part of the bear! it is so incredibly cheaply made. life has been very crazy and busy and i didn't realize the \\return window\\ is a mere month long from when the bear is shipped. i can however, return the cheaply made piece of junk for a \\partial\\ refund, and pay for all the shipping. that would amount to about the cost of the bear in the first place. terrible return policy!!! i'll just sew the bear up and not purchase another.    don't waste your money on this bear. mine wasn't even washed yet, and it's already ripped apart. i can only imagine how well it would withstand a washing or two. so disappointing."
"we received the chair in good shape from amazon. it is vey comfortable but very difficult to assemble. the snap for arm rest cushion are terrible, not fit each other at all. my husband has tried everything but still not able to make it fit. still don't know what to do with it."
"the item was dirty and the the rubber was rotten and discolored. it smells like ammonia. i had to return the item and ask for a refund, fortuately i had it."
I bought this for my child before he was born.  I had a c section and my family tried to help by setting up everything for me upon my return home with the baby. By the time I went to use this product for the first time it did not work and my family had thrown away the box.  Now I am stuck with crap that never worked.  DO NOT BUY.
this chair is super small!  i was very disappointed when it arrived.  it is much smaller then it appears online.
"The pacifiers sent are not the pacifiers pictured. These are a different name, made in another country and the wrong size. Customer service could not be made to understand that just because an item is made by the same company it is not the same item. Different markets have different items/sizes.  Bottom line is you no longer carry a staple item I purchase regularly for my 2 kids. I can not be sure you will not send me the wrong item again so I am buying from another source now."
"My baby love the newborn soothie pacifier,...but hates this one.    It is bulky and way too heavy.  it won't stay in his mouth.  Too bad!"
good idea put poorly made. The medicine leaks out and the pacifier part is very hard. My daughter rejected it immediately!  Went with another brand.
"Arrived with a broken zipper, thank you very much, which is not something that could have happened during shipping. That means it was sent out even though it obviously defective."
"I ordered these pacifiers because they are shown here as being neutral in color, but I recieved blue pacifiers with trucks on them!  And I have a girl!!! Its ok to say colors may vary if they work for both sexes, but this is not acceptable. Needless to say, they are going back."
"These looked totally different than what is shown on picture, not even close....different color, different shape..."
"unpacked it xmas day - we all loved it, it charged, changed colours, charged and now wont light at all. we have tried charging again and left it charging overnight - have tried every position for charging , pushing the bottom buttons etc. - going back today , clearly something is wrong. very disappointing."
"i'm shocked other reviewers thought this was a great cup. they are so shoddily constructed that when mine arrived on one cup the thingy you flip to cover the straw had already popped off, despite being in pretty sturdy packaging. it was difficult to put back on. the flip-top is very difficult to flip back and forth - my 15mo couldn't do it, while he can easily open and close the playtex ones.    the worst part was that these cups leak. a lot. my son throws his cup off the highchair when i'm not looking. the playtex ones never leak. these leak most of the contents immediately from where the cap screws on to the bottom.    i just threw them out -- i'd rather count the $ spent on them wasted than be forever cleaning up milk off the floor."
"i read all the reviews and although i cannot say it is a bad pacifier, all i can say is that my daugther hates it.  She screams when we try to give it to her.  But children's sucking preferences are different and my child does not like this one bit."
