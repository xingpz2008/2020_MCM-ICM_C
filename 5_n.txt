"With the exception of colors, this appears to be the same as an earlier model of the same brand I owned.  That was reliable for several years until slowing speed required replacement."

No problems with it. Works for me!
Thank you

"I bought this several years ago but I still use it.  This is a quiet, well made blow dryer that works very well.  It's expensive; but it's worth it."
buenisimo
Excelente
My Daughter loves it
I bought it 10 month ago. Its quality can be trusted.
Size and weight are what I had hoped for when purchasing this dryer for my upcoming trip overseas! Can't wait
Wanted same brand and wattage they have on the wall at our Y.<br />Perfect.  Just what my spouse was looking for.
This one replaced one which disappeared when my daughter went home.  It should last until it disappears like the last one.
Hair dryer works well.  It was inexpensive but still offered three speeds and three heat settimgs.  Would recommend purchase of this product.
I have purchased these over the years and like the fact that this one had a nite lite. I am still using this particular one and still have one I bought previously without a nite lite.
I have been using it now for almost 2 years with no problems yet.  Still blows like the day it came out of the box
I got this for my daughter for she like to do her hair a lot and washes it every day
My wife used this hair dryer at the Heathman Hotel in Portland and had to buy them for our VRBO  in Bend Or. Our VRBO 304450 incase you want to try the hair dryers!!!
"Similar to some reviewers, initially I became fond of this specific type of hair dryer when I was lodging in a hotel. The hair dryer has several combinations of blowing temperature and speed. I like the fact that its lowest wind level is low enough, unlike some of the hair dryers on the market which are way too power even set on the lowest switch. I found this item on amazon and the price is unbeatable. Recommend."
My wife requested it because she already had one at our 1st home and wanted one just like it for our 2nd home.
Can't beat it for the price! Has all the options you need. I would recommend to anyone. Also like that it's fairly quiet.
This is my second vidal sassoon dryer.<br />I bought a second one for travel.<br />I like the fact that it has 3 heat and 2 speed settings.<br />I may just get another for future use.
"This is very, very quiet. It has the longest cord. I have ever seen on a dryer. I don't understand the ion thing."
This hair dryer works well! I like its capacity while using it on my hair. i would recommend this product to any one who is looking for a simple dryer.
"This dryer rocks.  My daughter bought one for me last year and all of a sudden the heating element stopped working.  I had to buy another, this brand is different.  Hopefully wont have the same fate.  My hair dries in 15 minutes."
"My wife loves it, it's so quiet we can talk while she does her hair without her turning off the blow dryer to here what I said."
It was a gift my daughter requested. I purchased it for her for her birthday which happens to be on Christmas!
Everything I want in a hair dryer.  Used the same model in a hotel I stayed out and had to have one for myself and one for my daughter.
My wife loves it
"it came on time, I have not use it yet, but feel it will do what I need .  I wanted a comb attachment"
My wife loves it. She has evev reconended to familes and friend. The item has meat all expectations. Thank you
"After returning to Amazon a dryer that claimed to have a low noise level but did not, this one delivered on its promise.  Also, the diffuser is easier than some to use because you don't have to line up anything to put it on or remove it--it's a simple push on and pull off.  Have just started using this, so can't speak to its durability."
Purchased this for our trip to Europe this year.  It worked like a charm and insured that I was not going to blow up another hair dryer on our annual international sojourn.
This is the third wall mount I have purchased. L ove the convenience and that  I don't have to keep in a drawer.
"This hair dryer meets all my requirements.  It is compact, the cord stays out of the way the unit is reliable."
"this does what you think it will, dries hair. My wife likes it and she and her sisters use it all the time."
"Works well for my wife, it's not fancy, but it does the job well. If you're looking for an inexpensive hair dryer, this is the one."
My wife used it at a hotel for several days and wanted one for home use.  It met and exceeded her expectations
es practico y bueno... encantada con el producto desde vargas venezuela<br />se los recomiendo.. el producto llego en buen estado
I was never a fan of blow dryers but this one was awesome.I didn't like the attachment that accompanied the blow dryer but overall it works and i like it.I recommend it.
I looked everywhere for a dryer to meet my needs. This one is just exactily what I needed and wanted.
go o oo oo oo oo ooo o ooooo oo oo ooo ooo oo oo  oo oooo ooooo ooooooooooo oooooood
"excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad, responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor"
Es un regalo para mi gorda bella la mas bella que Dios me ha regalado en esta vida la amo
What can I say? I didn't buy this for me bought it for the wife.  I haven't used a hair dryer since 1989.  She loves this one.
"have everything i want,  go ooo oo o o o o o o o o o o oo o o d"
sorry I don't have anymore to say about it. It does what it's supposed to do. Okay? If you want reviews you're going to have to stop limiting the numbers of words.
"I had similar 1875W Revlon before, this one is slightly smaller. The air blow out got the same feeling and speed of heating up. For a hair dryer, it works ..."
"Bueno llego en perfecto estado y funciona muy bien ,es de buena potencia y el indicado  para relizar la el secado"
"Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras"
excelente muy buena calidad es preciosa a mi hija le gusto mucho y soy de venezuela y todo fue rapido
I have one in my guest bathroom and my visitors can use it. You dont have to looking one in the lower of the lavatory.
YO COMPRE ESTO PARA MI HIJA Y LE ENCANTO LE SALVA MUCHO TIEMPO Y DINERO CADA VES QUE ELLA QUIERE HACERCE EL PELO
"Instead of choosing among the four options, I decided to buy the big pony Collection Coffret so I could have then all at once."
En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rpida recomiendo al vendedor
"This dryer works like it should.    The dryer has an ionic on/off switch, which was the only reason we bought it."
I like the three temp. and three levels of air pressure. It makes a big difference I can use it for myself and for my daughter who does not like heat.
I love the smell of this and it lathers up perfectly. Unfortunately I was allergic to it. If not for that I would use it forever.
it does what it supposed to do. don't know what else to say than that.
The dryer works like a charm and is just what we were looking for. I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't want a hair dryer just lying around on their countertop.
I have purchased four Jerdon wall mount hair dryers - one for my home and three for our lake house. They are dependable and affordably priced.
Shipped fast. This dryer dries my thick long hair quite a bit qucker than the dryer it replaced. I also really like that the cord is extra long.  I don't plan to use the attachmens so I cannot comment on those.
i have thick hair and it always seems like I have to spend FOREVER drying my hair.  This blow dryer is small but powerful.  I love that it folds up to store easily.  My long hair dries in just a few minutes
"I love this hair dryer.  It is very quiet, the retractable cord works well, and it has a cold setting as well as a cold button. It feels solid and is easy to handle.  It's everything I was looking for in a dryer and at a very reasonable price."
This is my second Blackbird.  I had the first one for 10 years before it gave out.  I have very thick hair and it takes about 20 minutes of drying to style and dry my hair.  I'm hoping I have this one as long as the first one.
"Love this hair dryer!  I used it at a hotel recently and couldn't believe the power of this little dryer.  I have long, thick hair and my hair was dry in no time! Would definately recommend!"
"Not too big, not too small.  My hair is short, and I use this for a few minutes and it's done.  Easy Peasy."
"Blow-dries in half the time of my old, dinosaur of a hair dryer!  I have used it for about a month now, with no problems at all!  Would definitely recommend!"
"I love this blow drier. Cut my blow dry time in half. I bought the leopard/cheetah print one. The price on this item has changed significantly, unfortunately. When I purchased, this dryer was significantly less expensive than other colors of the same model. Before ordering and receiving I was concerned it was a knock off because it was cheaper than the other two color options. I do think it is real. It works well. Feels well made. I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I've had about 2 months now and it works well. I also had one of my good friends look at it closely. She is a cosmetologist and currently works at a salon that sells this brand. She said it looked authentic to her."
"I considered shelling out some serious cash to buy a high end blow-dryer but then I realized that's stupid...and I'm cheap, so I bought this instead and I honestly could not be happier!  I have long hair (like to the middle of my back) and it's pretty thick and this dryer dries my hair in under 10 minutes.  My last dryer took FOR.EV.ER so to avoid getting stared down by my husband and watching the hate build in his eyes because I was taking so long to get ready and thus withholding whatever meal we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).<br /><br />I recommend this dryer highly!  No need to waste your hard earned cash on a high end dryer; this one does the job!"
"My daughter recommended that I buy this dryer.  I have curly hair that absorbs water and, even though my hair is short, it usually takes a long time to dry one strand.  By that time some of the other hair gets frizzy.  This dryer is a vast improvement over the many other dryers I own.  I also bought it for my daughter-in -law who has long hair and was frustrated with the drying time. Her hair is straight and she loves this product."
"I bought this to replace a previous Conair hair dryer, despite reviews that said it would be too heavy.  Once the cord is unwound, it's really not heavy (and you wouldn't use it with the cord retracted).  Not having to manually wind up the cord for storage is such a time and headache saver.  It makes it so easy to put it away everyday in a drawer instead of leaving it out on the counter, still plugged in."
"Bought this unit for traveling to Europe, very compact for travel and with the dual voltage it's a plus.<br />But you'll still need an adapter for  the European receptacles, from the flat blade to the round one."
This is definitely lighter than my last hair dryer. It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.
"Once I used this hair dryer, I noticed how quickly, efficiently and with less noise dried my hair.  I can definitely see a difference with the efficiency when compared to hotel and hair dryers sold at a local drug store.<br /><br />The delivery of the dryer was as promised, delivered promptly.<br /><br />I would recommed this vendor and product to my friends."
"I've had pixie short hair that dried in 5 minutes for most of my adult life. But since I've decided to grow my hair out, it has taken forever to dry. I wanted a hair dryer that was fool-proof and unintimidating and this product definitely delivered. It has 4 settings: cold, high, low, off which are pretty self-explanatory. Seriously, any newbie can operate this. Now I wake up with perfectly set hair because I'm able to dry and semi-style it in the evening before I go to sleep, with a little argan or sweet almond oil on my scalp as a heat protectant.<br /><br />People have complained that the 'cool' setting is not cool enough, but I actually like that. I don't like using the hot settings too often for fear of ruining my hair, but cold air would be difficult to deal with in cold weather."
"I had to get a second one because I was taking it to my dad's and bringing it back for my husband. Love these things. If you want a close trim without having to break out the old sharp razor (that usually makes you bleed), this is your trimmer. I use this on my dad's face. He has a very stiff beard."
"This really works.  I've tried several ceramic, ionic dryers in the past few years and I saw absolutely no difference in how my fine ,&#34; prone to frizz in humidity&#34; hair came out after blowing it dry.  With my new Panasonic, my hair looks smoother, less frizzy and stays that way during the day. For me, this is a keeper!"
"I love it, of course my husband used it before I did.  It does not burn me like other hair dryers, it does not frizz my thin hair."
"i love the seche top coat, but was disappointed in its base coat. this one is much better. it definitely strengthens my nails and prevents chipping."
"No night light on this model - just what I wanted.  It is smaller, so the power is a little lower, but it fits in my small bathroom"
"I recomend this Hair Dryer, It's small and works well, the Heat settings work well for fast Drying and Styling.  It's small enough to go with you on Trips, Or use at the house without taking up much Room.  Get one !"
Although the package was damaged on arrival the contents were intact.  This was replacement for an identical Conair unit that my Bride has used continually for several years.  We expect the new Conair to be as serviceable as the previous one.
"This hair dryer really packs a punch.  I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola and I had to buy it.  I've had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn't get too hot.  It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry.  With this dryer I'm down to 8 and mid way through I switch to warm.<br /><br />Excellent dryer for this price!"
"THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME. I DID NOT REALIZE HOW BAD MY OLD DRYER WAS UNTIL I STARTED USING THIS ONE. I CAN DRY MY VERY THICK, CURLY HAIR IN NO TIME AND CONTROL ANY FRIZZ."
"I have been using drugstore brand (revlon, clairol, etc) hair dryers for years.  Recently, I found that no matter what brand I bought, the heat would go from hot to cold and the dryer took forever to dry my hair.  I decided to upgrade to a higher end dryer and am so thankful I did.  This dryer cuts the drying time in half and my hair is not frizzy.  I just went away for the weekend and every single one of my girlfriends asked to borrow my hair dryer and are now buying one.<br /><br />The dryer is a bit heavier than the drugstore brands but it's also twice as powerful.  The buttons do take a minute to get used to, but after a day they shouldn't be an issue anymore.<br /><br />I (and my girlfriends) would recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  I won't ever go back to the &#34;cheapies&#34; again."
"Quality hair dryer still working years later.  Because of the rounded edges, it does not sit on a flat surface well and mine has fallen and gotten chipped over the years but it still works."
"I was tired of dealing with a large blow dryer on a daily basis, and wanted one that was small enough to fold and pack for a trip.  This blow dryer is powerful and dries my hair in less than five minutes.  Highly recommended!"
"I bought this a few months ago and decided to go ahead and just now review it after months of using it.  I love it.  I had one of these growing up and I didn't know they still made hair dryers like these.  It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It's not too heavy.  I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles."
i have very long and thick hair. this drys my hair very fast! would recommend it
I love this blow dryer for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1.  It has a super long cord which is awesome<br />2.  It had not only high and low but you can adjust the heat level as well.<br /><br />There are some things I don't like as well:<br /><br />1.  It is a little heavy but nothing that would sway me from buying again<br />2.  The buttons are in a bad spot and I occasionally bump them.<br /><br />I would definately recommend.
"I have been using it for almost 3 years! I don't have anything negative to say about it! Love that it has different speed and heat settings. If anyone complains it is too big or heavy, well, I've got to say this is not a portable hair dryer."
"I feel so silly ordering toothpaste from the internet, but none of my local stores stock this gel bottle version anymore! Our local pharmacy usually has the Cinnamon Rush in a tube, which is okay, but I really prefer the texture of this gel. And the multi-pack price is really generous (at least compared to what toothpaste sells for individually at retail)."
This replicates the same dryer I had for years but finally bit the dust.  Long time Conair buyer.
"These were purchased for a vacation home. I wanted something that could be mounted off counter - like in a hotel.  They seem to work well, but I don't know how long they will last, with renters. Only time will tell."
This blow dryer does not dry out my hair...while a little loud...I have soft hair after using this dryer everytime
"I have curly hair and this hair dryer has a cold setting which helps to keep my curls from being frizzy.  My last hair dryer did not have a cold setting but just a freeze type button.  I actually wore out the button so I needed to purchase a new hair dryer.  I like that this dryer does not have a flimsy, lightweight feel. I also love that it is black with pink accents.  I am very glad I purchased this product."
"When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  Last night I washed my hair and decided to try out this &#34;mini toy&#34;.  I was truly amazed;  while it didn't dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  For travel, you can't go wrong with this dryer!"
"Very powerful for a small hair dryer.  Bought this solely to use when I travel, because not all places provide a hair dryer.  But the places that do provide a hair dryer, the quality is poor.  So...bought one for myself and love it!  Especially the pink color and small little zebra print carrying case."
Works well.  Very convenient to use.  Just like in hotels.  Compact design takes up very little room on the wall.
"Wifey had one for 8 years, w/o big issues; until it died.<br />She loves it, and as a professional stylist she knows a thing ot two about the topic.<br />I bought her another one for Christmas, so hopefully manufacture haven't change specs dated as previous one."
Every day I used to dread blow drying my hair. It's long and thick and after a half an hour it still wouldn't be dry. This hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 3-4 minutes max. It has totally changed my life. I have bought one more just to have on hand. You never know how long a hair dryer will last.
"This has cut down on my drying time and is very gentle to my hair.  While it is expensive, it is well worth it."
Dryer is lightweight and delivers a lot of heat.  Dries and smoothes hair quickly. Cuts down drying time down in half.  Wont go back to standard dryers.
It works very well and I use it everyday!
"Traveling abroad?  Most foreign countries use 220 VAC instead of the USA 120 VAC.  This means that if you try your hair dryer overseas it will work for about 1 second and fail.  This unit has a voltage selector switch so it will work no matter what the voltage is.  Folds to much smaller unit, name branded.  Remember to buy the correct country plug adaptor."
"Long lasting, and serves it purpose!!!!!"
Product performs as expected. All plastic housing beats the partial rubberized housing of my old Revlon dryer. The rubber on the old housing becomes extremely tacky.
These brushes seem to be near extinct. It's the only (type) of hairbrush that my husband wants and has used for a lot of years. Bought 2 just in case.
"This was a gift for my wife who has just longer than shoulder length, thick hair. She really loves it!"
I've used this band of hair dryers of 15 years now. They are well made and do last a long time. I'm on my third one. They are very easy to replace. Just remove the hair dryer and cord from the new one and place on the wall holder and plug in. No need to pull the unit base from the wall and mar your paint or paper.
"My wife needed a new dryer and bought this because of the reviews. Its on the bigger size compare to the smaller dryers which we normally use. But its a slightly quieter as it does not struggle for air. The handle do fold to help with storing it everyday. Over all, we like it and hope that it last longer than other Conairs which we used before."
"Another 5 star rating for this hair dryer!  I have really thick hair with some natural wave that usually takes a long time to dry.  This dryer gets it dry in about half the time of other dryers I've used, and dries it straighter.  I don't have to use the flat iron nearly as much to tame the poof.  Good buy!"
Easy to use and right at your fingertips Ilovesanta that's tuts tote wall and shuts off when returned to base.
Have had this dryer for about a year. When I first received it I was concerned that it did not seem to blow as hard as the dryer I had been using but it actually seems to dry my hair faster.
This was an exact replacement for an older model that failed.  Just what the wife wanted.  Hope it outlasts us both.
"I've used Conair dryers for years, but they share the same issue with other brands......the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....causing the unit to overheat and eventually die.  I've tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff just plain won't come off the filter.<br /><br />I just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  I was surprised.....this unit has a REMOVABLE screen filter!  Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure it's totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.<br /><br />Big selling point in my opinion....removable filter info should be in the description.  Bravo, Conair, well done!"
The best blow dryer ever. 23 Afro American female I use with a long hard comb attachment and this makes blow drying so much easier because I have long thick hair and I hate doing it myself but this definitely helps out when I'm tryna save money but skipping the salon
Dries my super thick hair faster than any other hair dryer I've owned.
"Small, powerful,easy to take on trips,..,occupies very little space, light weight, works in Europe with no hassle,easy to pack,attractive design"
"I've had my blo and go for a month now, after a recent accident left me severely handicapped this little item has saved my life when it comes to getting my hair dried. Can't recommend this enough whether you got one or both hands you just won't believe how much help this is."
"My husband insisted I search for a new, QUIET hairdryer and I chose this one based on all of the reviews. In comparison to the last few hairdryers I have had it is incredibly quiet and it is also very powerful. I have very thick hair that usually takes around 20 minutes to get dry and this has done it in half the time. Highly recommend it!"
"I'm not sure if I had low expectations going in or what but very pleasantly surprised with the results. Not too loud, fits my head properly and will dry your hair ( obviously you're probably going to sit under there for awhile.. Took me about 2hr30mins ). Money well spent ( especially considering the $$$ spent at the salon)."
I have very long hair so it use to take me about 20 min to dry .  I read the reviews so I thought I would take a chance What a differece With this hair dryer it only took 5 min I could not believe it def not sending this one back
"I really like this dryer.  Not sure why complaints about the cord - directions say to hold the plug.  If you don't hold the plug of course it's gonna snap back and hit you.  As for the noise.  Yes, it is noisy but you are using it for a short time and it is just as noisy as any other hair dryer.  And it is not too heavy.  I think it dries my hair fast and arm does not get tired.  All in all, I would recommend this dryer.  I love that it is pink, the cord retracts and takes up little space for storage."
My daughter loves the color pink so I had to get it. Simple speeds as a standard hair dryer.
Dries my hair in half the time as my old hair dryer.
"So powerful and light ,for that price it left behind all expensive Italian hairdryers"
"Dries my extremely thick, long hair quickly.  I use leave-in conditioner, brush out with my Wet Brush and then use the comb attachment to dry.  It takes &#60;10 min.  This is unheard of for me.  Its also fairly quiet.  My friends are sick or hearing about it so, I thought I'd tell Amazonians... I really love this hair dryer!"
I read the reviews before making a decision.  The one negative review was wires shorting out..but I know you shouldn't wrap cord tightly around the dryer.  It's powerful and it works!
"I looked at this little dryer for one criterion that was my exclusive priority - I wanted a small handheld dryer that would not scare my pet cockatiel bird when I dry him after his shower in the winter! Needless to say, its color, size, sound and portability mattered. I chose this and couldn't be happier. He loves it too. The heat of both settings is ideal, it worked well for my hair too. The fact that it is dual voltage was not as important to me, although we travel to Europe a lot, but I can use the dryers in the hotel itself. It does sound a little louder than I had thought after reading reviews that it was quiet. The other issue is that the slider switch is a little difficult to operate and tends to slide all the way from end to end. It is difficult to move to the off position in the center."
"My wife has M/S and she has difficulty holding the hair dryer. I was skeptical of this product working because it is one of those As seen on TV products. Boy, was I surprised. Out of the box, on the mirror, connected the hair dryer and hands free drying. We happened to have a full size mirror above the bathroom sink. Since the blo and go is a little heavy, I don't think it would work well on a small mirror of a medicine cabinet."
I also found this dryer at a hotel. Loved how quickly it dried my very thick hair! Was even happier when I found out how inexpensive it is!
I have long thick hair and I go through blow dryers like crazy. This blow dryer dries my hair quickly. It's not too heavy and is easy to hold. Love it!
"I used to spend six hours doing my girls' naturally coily and kinky hair. Drying time has now been cut to an average if five minutes, which in turns means a styling time of two hours total on the girls. This dryer gave me my weekends back. Only down side is that the ones I've had go out after roughly two years. I'm on my third t3 since 2011."
I hate weak hair dryers. But this one is AMAAAZING!!! It's got A LOT of power!! I don't really use a lot of the cool setting on it  ..but it feels like an  air conditioner because of how cold it gets. If you want a great hair dryer for cheap this is absolutely worth it. The only thing I could say that would be a con is the cord. I wish it was retractable.
"Plain and simple - this is a great hair dryer.  I have my cosmetology license and have bought very expensive dryers in the past, with the same results as I've gotten with (this) Andis' moderately priced version.  I will seek out this brand without hesitation in the future."
"My wife bought this for our recent Europe trip.  Small, though not tiny like her old one, but plenty of power, folds for packing, dual voltage means no convertor needed for use on 240V/50Hz in Europe (you do need the little plug adaptor, which is not included).  She says sh'll use in place of her old one when we get home."
"I have very long, thick blonde hair. Usually I don't have the patience to blow-dry my hair. I have been using the same hot pink Conair blow-dryer for about 3 years and it takes at least 20 mins to get my hair completely dry. I used this Andis product at a hotel I stayed in in NYC and loved it! It dried my hair in less than 10 minutes. I wrote down the brand name of the blow-dryer and bought it on amazon.com the day I got home from my trip.<br />I have already recommended it to all of my girlfriends!"
"Bought this item for my husband who is on his feet 24/7 and has difficult toenails and a sore ankle.  Applying the balm to his ankle definitely seemed to improve blood circulation as the pain diminished and the 'black and blue' appearance also normalized.  I figured I would try it on my extremely dry skin - even on my face after a day working in the backyard.  It was very soothing and not greasy at all.  Dry, dead skin that I couldn't even see flaked off and fine lines are smoother.  I will definitely recommend this - easier to use than Euciren - and goes a long, long way."
I hate having to buy a new hair dryer. After reading all the reviews AND finding this in Amazon warehouse I'm thrilled with the Turbo Power 3200-wish it was pink but oh well.
I owned this hair dryer for about five years and used it nearly daily. It finally started making a weird noise so I replaced it with the exact same model. A five year life span for such an inexpensive hair dryer exceeded my expectations.
I work outside and in Indiana in the winter time it gets relly cold. Your hands take a beating and dry up. I use this to prevent my hands from bleeding. I love this product and would recommmend to anyone.
This is a very small dryer but with a BIG punch!  I was shocked how much power this little dynamo has... I can dry my hair faster than I ever could with my larger hand held dryer.  It is perfect for a small wall space and keeps my counter clutter free...Highly recomended!
Drys my hair quickly. My hair is thick this dryer cuts my time in half. I would recommend it for anyone.
"This was my first Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer. I was looking for a hair dryer that would cut my drying time because I have thick hair. What a surprise, it did just that! It cut my drying time to a third of what it used to take with my old hair dryer. It proved to be as advertised. It made my hair smoother, shinier and less frizzy too!"
"I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet. It's not real quiet, but then it is blowing air. My dog was a little shy of it at first. But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine. He now looks forward to being blow dried after his bath and when we come in out of the rain or snow. It seems well made. I will have to see how long it lasts."
The design is extremely well done with a fast dry and not that heavy.  The switches are out of the way and there no accidently switch off or temperature change.
My daughter wanted an drier with a air disperser on it. This was exactly what they she wanted. The drier works exactly as stated. The only issue is it's bulking too bad you can't fold it.
Really love the cold setting.
"Busy mom has drying time cut in half, plus shinier hair. Only regret I have is not buying sooner! Also, it is quiet which is soothing to me and less intimidating to my littles on the occasion I dry their hair."
Small did not think was gonna be so small but overall really powerful for size
"Definitely effective for seborrhoeic dermatitis.  My only complaint is that its expensive.  However, the bar lasts forever."
I buy one of these wall mount dryers every time my old dryer is exhausted.<br />I use it everyday and it lasts a long time before replacing it.  I am pleased<br />with its durability.
"I have used a conair dryer before and liked it.  The last one a had lasted about 13 years, so I thought I would go with the conair<br />again, and I haven't been disappointed."
I had been looking for a professional style blow dryer. My hair was growing back thin after cancer. My old blow dryer didn't give volume to my hair as this dryer does. Wish I had it sooner.
"I used to hate drying my hair... I have thick long hair, it took forever.  I am also pretty frugal.  So when my cheap old hair drying stopped working, I bought this. What a difference! My hair dries faster! yeah!"
"This is the second one of these I have purchased because I dropped my other one and broke it. This hair dryer seriously does make my hair smoother, and when you use the concentrating attachment, it really works!"
It is hard to find a pistol style hair dryer these day. I assume that majority went less bulky shape because it look nicer. My first priority is quiet operations and this pistol shape produce quieter air flows.
"I have always hated blow drying my hair, but this dryer makes it easier due to the handle being so thin. I usually use it on low settings and it works great. I love this hair dyer."
my wife and I have used this product for at least 10 years every day and it finally wore out so I had to buy a new one.
The product works as advertised and actually dries my hair in less than half the time as my other hair dryer with much less heat!  I almost didn't believe it was possible until using this unit.  The only problem is the color of the unit is not the same as what's here or even on the box.  I was expecting red.  It's not.  It's a metallic hot pink.  Definitely something difficult for a man to pull off unless you're married and can claim it belongs to your wife.
very well constructed hair dryer.. it's one of the heavy duty built that you can get for little price...
"These are great.Our other got used so much , it finally quit. Reason 3 girls.enough said. so go buy one."
It was so hard to find a blow dryer that had a lot of airflow and this one meets the price/performance ratio. I highly recommend this.
"This model does NOT have the ion feature. I like that, but I don't  use it to dry hair."
Use it to dry my dog.
Product was purchased to blow dry my dog's hair because his doggy towels don't fully dry him thus I would recommend this product.
At this point I've had this hair dryer for over a year. I don't have any complaints it' works well. I blow dry my hair about 5 days a week.
My husband and I got tired of having a blow dryer that either took up space on the counter or got pulled off the counter every time the drawer opened.  I ordered this and he mounted it on the wall under a towel rack.  We use the dryer and then place it back and it is very inconspicuous.
"I bought two of these and they work well.  One that I had for two years now has one broken switch, but is still useful.  I use these for heating and drying a wide variety of things."
My wife wanted this to replace an old broken one.  It arrived on time and works as advertised with no problems so far.  She said she likes it.
Love it. Have very long thick hair. Cut drying time almost in half. Did not frizz my hair as other dryers have in the past.
I have long hair.  Used to take me 40 minutes to blow dry my hair.  This dryer has cut down the time to 20 minutes TOTAL.  It's a time saver.
"I typically don't use hair dryers, but I initially bought this product because I was sick and tired of my hair being wet when I left for work (especially during winter).<br /><br />My wife used this one time and loved it so much, that she has now started to use it herself! One day, she used her old one (I guess to compare power and dry time) and it now seems incredibly weak.  My caution is that this hair dryer will become the standard by which you judge all other dryers!<br /><br />*Important note: For those of you who buy this and don't typically use hair dryers, there is no directions that tell you that the &#34;fan button&#34; has to be turned on, AND THEN the heat button.  The heat button does not start it by itself."
It works as advertised without problems.  It just has limited options except speed.
"I've used this little guy daily for the past 3 months and I gotta say I love it!<br /><br />My only problem with it is how bulky the plug is. I mean, seriously, if you want it to be a PORTABLE dryer, don't have the end of the cord be almost as big as the handle.<br /><br />In terms of performance, however, I cannot complain."
Serves the purpose excdellent. Easy hand held position compared to other dryer are awkward to hold. I definitely would recommend this dryer and seller to a friend.
I have thick hair and it is really hard to get my hair dries in under 30 min but this hair dryer does it everytime. love the fact that the handle folds to save space and as its been dropped  a few times i know it is well put together and sturdy i would recommend tis product.
"Once again something I couldn't find on store shelves when my old one finally burned out, and once again a seller on Amazon came to the rescue, ordered 2 so I have a back up, nothing worse than your old hair dryer going on the fritz half way thru the job and no back back up, talk about bad hair day. Shipper got them to me quickly."
"Another device that is a powerhouse in a small package.  I had a very expensive white designer hairdresser before this and it still took forever to dry hair, and got so hot doing so that kids and pets yowl.  This dryer works in record time, blows the moisture out like those car dryer things at the car wash, and doesn't burn hair or scalp doing so.  It is also fairly quiet for the power.  I am not a pro hairdresser so can't speak for that, but for the family bath night, it is fast without the  furious."
"I have used these little wall-hung hair dryers while on vacation and wondered if I would like one at home.  I DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tossed my Remington and LOVE this little, convenient giant of a hair-dryer!  I think I am drying my hair in HALF the time I previously took.  WHY didn't I buy this sooner???  :)"
"Medium weight, not too heavy like other professional dryers<br />Easy controls<br />Dries hair fast!<br />No tangle or twist power cord"
Hasn't broken yet. Blows hot air. Review over.
This baby has power!  I have very thick hair......and a lot of it........this cut my blow drying time down significantly!!  It is a little loud but is totally worth it.  The only problem I had was it set off my smoke detector when I was using a round brush with it.
"This hair dryer is a life saver!  I have long, thick, curly, frizzy hair, and this product is the cure all!  Takes me about 15 minutes to blow dry and style my hair.  My hair dresser recommended this product,and she was spot on! Highly recommended!"
"A blow dyrer that gets the job done. I have very thick hair that requires a lot of heat. The Andis 1875 Watt provided that and what would normally take about 30 minutes only took 15.  The comb attachment is heavy duty and durable. I dropped it on the floor twice before using it and it remained intact.  I will say the dryer is on the heavy side but I didn't care because I'd finally found a PROFESSIONAL grade, affordable, and durable hair dryer."
"It's a hairdryer.  It blows cold air over a heating element and makes it hot.  That hot air evaporates and carries away the water in your hair, making it dry.  Hardly rocket science.  It does all the above well.<br /><br />The ion function only works when the cold blast button is pressed, so I don't have to worry about where all those extra electrons hangin' off the negative ions will end up.<br /><br />The overall slow speed of the fan coupled with the diffuser makes a nice, safe warmer for cold winter feet, too."
"This little gadget does exactly what it was made for, hold my dryer.  I had an inferior one before that was always falling, usually in the middle of the night, waking us.  As I am disabled, I need my rest & I need something to hold my dryer.  This works so well, I got one for my mother, too."
"Tried this blow dryer at a hotel, went to my iPhone and ordered it immediately. I have long, curly hair and even on the slow speed, it dries my hair fast with less frizz."
Love this hairdryer! I have very thick hair and lots of it so it takes a long time to dry. But it takes less than five minutes with this hairdryer. There's one attachment that comes with it which diffuses the air wide and i use it to give more volume. I realized how miserable my drying experience was before this purchase. Well deserve 5 star rating!
"This hair dryer fills the bill to a tee.  It is small, but yet it performs just as well as the former larger unit."
"Just prefect for hair drying. Dry me hair within 10 sec, and my wife's in 2 mins.<br />Hair feel even softer after."
Works as well as the expensive ones. Super price.
"i am grateful to still be able to find this type of dryer.  they are very hard, impossible, to find in a store on the shelf.  so thanks for letting us count on you to find items for us."
VERY QUIET.  PLENTY OF SETTINGS.  TAKES NO TIME TO GET MY HAIR DRY.  THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE STYLING ATTACHMENTS GET VERY HOT.
"I argued with my lady about buying this hair dryer. I told her there were others, others less expensive, that would do the job. It is after all just  drying hair. After buying and trashing a Conair I finally bought her this Turbo Power dryer. THe complants stopped, the dryer still works and I am her hero. The rewards were worth the investment."
Perfection! Just the right heat and no more overly dried out hair! Thank you!
"I bought the same model Conair 9-10 years ago, and have usually used it every day. It still works.  I bought it again just to have when the other must surely ultimately die.<br /><br />Product longevity is why I bought it again."
This hair dryer was recommended to me by a hair stylist at the salon I use. It works beautifully. A little heavier than my former Conair (which lasted 10 years). My diffuser fits on it. Has a cleanable compartment for lint.
"My daughter recently bought this hair dryer and let me dry my hair with it.  It dryed my thick shoulder length hair in  a little over 5 minutes. I love it.  My hair has a little wave in it, in the wrong places, and this straightens that out if I use a wide round brush with it. It does get rid of the small amount of frizz I have.  My daughter has long, frizzy, thick hair and she found this dryer to dry quickley and smooth down her hair."
"Love it as a home use dryer.  Not compact enough to qualify as a travel dryer in my book but it's the best dryer I've ever owned.  I have LOTS of thick, course, wavy hair and this appliance dries it in half the time (or less) than all of my previous ones without excessive heat.  Love the cold shot. It really is cold.  Get this dryer.  You will not be disappointed!"
It is everything I expected..
Great...exactly what I expected
"works as expected, compact, just what i needed to take to the pool with me"
This hair dryer performs exactly as expected and advertised.  I recommend it.
as expected
The hair dryer works as expected.
Works as expected
just as expected
Exactly as expected
"Absolutely not complaints about this thing. Gives off lots of heat, has adjustments for everything and it retracts the cord when not in use."
It is in use every day.  There are currently few quality hair dryers in existence; this is definitely one of them.
Delivered on time. This is the only dryer my wife likes. She uses it everyday.
"This thing takes a damp haired, angry wife, into a glowing beauty with gorgeous hair. It also has a suctioning action that's not advertised, it sucks the angry out of nearby females and it pacifies them in a way I've never seen before."
"I have been a blowdry failure all my life! Just can't seem to use a normal-size blow dryer to style my hair without blowing all the previously styled hair to smithereens. When I opened the box for this dryer and saw how small it was, I thought What, is this battery-operated?? It will take forever to dry my hair! But I have been pleasantly surprised. It is powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and lightweight enough that my arm  doesn't tire when I style for volume. I can move it around and hold it up in the air, behind my head, whatever. If you have limited arm movement or muscles that fatigue easily, this is the dryer for you. I do wish it had a cold shot button, but that is the only drawback."
Was looking for a blow dryer that would dry my thick hair in under 45 minutes and I found it. Definitely not for thin hair.<br /><br />This is exactly what I was looking for.
"I have long and thick hair,usually take me over and hour to dry my hair but with this hairdryer it only take me 30 minutes."
"I have VERY thick hair, and this really did cut down on my drying time.  I use the cold button when I'm done and it seems to make my hair a little more manageable."
Dry's  well and is small enough to pack for travel.
"We have a cabin in Tennessee that we use as our vacation home.  Half the time, we forget to take a hair dryer with us.  This has solved that problem.  The dryer has a long cord.  The cord hanger can be moved to either side when mounting but it probably isn't even needed."
"Three heat settings, three fan settings, a truly cold &#34;cold shot&#34;, and tons of power. As my hair has been getting longer, I've been  cutting it close for work in the morning and realized it's the dang hairdryer! It took forever for me to dry my hair. I went through 2 dryers from the box store (both returned) and couldn't find 'the one.' I didn't want to spend a gazillion dollars!  So for the price, the Remington Pearl is a miracle. It's the best hairdryer I've ever used and I can get to work on time now!"
Dry that hair for less than $13...
This dryer was recommended by my hairstylists. It really does make drying time fast. You won't be disappointed with this blow dryer.
I have tried at least 2 other products that did not work for me because I am very sensitive to chemicals and even plant materials in cosmetics. This has occured to me even with cosmetics that claim to be hypoallergenic. Eye Revival not only worked to moisturize and reduce the circles under my eyes but also did not produce any allergic reactions. I am overjoyed that I have found a product that works and that I can use long term. No more wasted time or money!
This stuff worked miracles on my callused feet and my cuticles. Along with being antimicrobial you can't miss with this product. Very little goes along way so it will last you.
Very quiet. Bought this to replace my girlfriend's stupid loud blow dryer that woke me up every morning. This thing is much easier on the ears.
i bought this item and got it today and i did my rollers and all and i just loveeee the way it works! its small & the hood is really big to put rollers . i feel like i just came out of the salon. money well spent !
Small enough for travel and does the job.
So convenient for me to do other things while drying my hair without having to lug one of the self standing one around
"I installed these in the bathrooms of our house.  No more hairdryers on the counters, tangled cords, etc.  No replacing the portable units every year.  Only wish is I had done this 10 years ago."
This dryer works well with a round brush. I almost don't need to straighten it. It takes and extra few minutes but saves flat iron time.<br />It's not too heavy but it feels well put together.
"It takes a long time to dry very long, thick hair like mine, so a dryer with a heavy duty AC motor is a must.  It might be a bit heavy, but it works well and should last a while."
anyone else have trouble attaching the nozzles for this dryer. Neither one of them screwed in place. I am returning it and ordering another in the hopes that this is just a defect specific to this dryer.<br /><br />*** The replacement arrived and still had trouble screwing in the nozzles. So I asked my daughter-in-law if she could do it. She promptly snapped them into place. After which she made some vague references to dementia that I couldn't quite follow .... <br /><br />So I have amended my rating because it really is a quiet yet fast little dryer.
I got this for my gf and she loves using it. She used to hate taking showers at night just because of the wet hair but this thing changed her life :)
"This is the only diffuser of this variety I've ever found that has short fingers.  Normally the fingers are so long that it is impossible to get the heat close enough to my hair to not take forever to dry.  (I hated those long fingers when I had long hair, and I still hate them now that I have short [not even to my chin] hair!)  This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn't bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  Might cause frizz for tight curls, though."
The first time I used it I saw the difference with my hair. My hair was softer and less frizzy.<br />But I still find it expensive.
"Thank you!! the cream was delivered earlier than expected ..and it works so well, my scars lightened noticeably within a weak..now it can hardly be seenn!! I will definitely buy from you again!!!"
This hair dryer is great--it's lightweight and dries my hair in half the time of all other hair dryers I've used.
"The hair dryer is very easy to install.  You first mount a flat metal plate to the wall and then the base unit attaches to that plate.  We bought these for a vacation rental and appreciate the fact that the power cord is attached to the base unit and not the hair dryer itself.  While this may not be convenient or preferred for home use, in a vacation rental it keeps them in one place."
Lighter than my previous hair dryer.  And it dries faster with softer results.
Ive been blowdrying my hair for years why didn't I buy this sooner?! It dries my hair in half the time
It's a hairdryer =-)  Makes less noise than some. Works well and is recommended.
"Drys quickly, not overly noisy, switches are conveniently placed (where they're not accidentally moved on/off)  The air filter can be removed for cleaning.  I use all three temperature settings, both fan speeds, and the cool-shot button."
I have thick hair and it dries it in a fraction of the time of other dryers.  Heavy but doesn't bother me esp. since I don't have to hold it as long as others.
"I was skeptical because it was so small but this baby packs a punch.  My hair is past the halfway point of my back. I have long thick hair and it is ombred (bleached). Sometimes chemically treated hair takes forever to dry but this thing does the job as if it's a regular sized hair dryer. Definitely a plus. If it breaks, you'll bet I'll just buy another without complaint."
This dryer works as well as everyone said it does. [...]. Definately a difference in the speed of drying your hair and how it looks afterwards. It is quiet and also a bit heavier to hold than other dryers I have used. The price I paid getting it on Amazon was at least $30 cheaper than what I saw it selling for in the stores. It is worth it...you won't be disappointed.
Lots of power in this little guy - handle folds if storage is a problem in a drawer or a suitcase.
lots of power in this little dryer
Discovered this little gem in a hotel in NYC. Dries hair without leaving frizz or fly-aways. Folding handle makes it convenient for storing and travel.
I will now be saving money by going less to my hairstylist. This blowdryer dried my hair 2x faster than a previous blowdryer I had.  I wished I had bought this blowdryer years ago!
"I have thick, thick hair.  I have envied the speed with which my hair dresser dries my hair - and finally gave in and purchased the hair dryer she uses - the 3200 Twin Turbo.  I may not have the expertise she has in using it, but my goal has been achieved - my hair is dried SPEEDILY."
It does the job for me.  A bit heavy but otherwise is just what I wanted.  I would buy again.
"I was iffy after I ordered this product with all the horrible things that were said about it, but I really like this hair dryer.  I only use the cold settings to dry my hair in general.  I am already using it for a few months and I love it.  Don't depend on what people have to say unless you try it.  Unless of course it is all bad."
"It's really not that heavy o_O like holding a well-sized book in my hand lolol.<br />It's also not very loud, just what I expect hearing at the hair salon to be honest.<br />Some people say it's ugly, but who cares? It's not like I'm going to parade around town blow drying people with unsavory hairstyles."
"Beat blow dryer! My husband purchased one for me at Ukta for $80. It had a short in it and blew up. I purchased this one off Amazon. I have crazy thick hair. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry. This cuts the time down in half. It is on the heavy side and the buttons are in a horrible place, buy I love it!"
"Takes 2 hours to dry, but easier to sit under than the hard hat dryers! My hair is thick shoulder length and I use the jumbo pink rollers to set."
I looooove looooove this hair dryer.  It's lightweight and has cut my drying time in HALF!
Dries my hair in the half the time of any dryer I have used. My husband and kids thank you!
This has cut my drying time in half! It's a bit heavier than I was expecting but still exceeded expectations.
"I already have one of thise, but because I travel a lot, I have one at home and one for my travel trailer. Lots of heat & power in a small little dryer."
I saw this in a hotel I was staying in and came home and ordered! Takes a mess off the counter and works like a pro. Turns my bathroom into that hotel feel every morning!
"Works well, replaced an older Jerdon wall mount that died. No dangling cords, and difficult to drop and break it!"
No complaints. She loves it. &#34;I used to hate drying my hair but now I actually enjoys it&#34;. &#60;-----Actual girlfriend quote<br /><br />Draws A LOT of power. Tripped the breaker in our old house. Not so anymore.
Lots of power for a little dryer!
Was everything they said it was takes up very little space and does the job
Dried my wife's thick hair in 10 minutes.
"Just what I wanted.  Small, but powerfull."
I've had 2 Conair dryers which have failed me in the last couple of years....This has ION select so you can use this feature if you want or turn it off.
i have never had a ionic hairdryer...i have no more frizz after i blow my hair out. i have for years used conditioner thinking this would help with the frizzing but i had no conditioner and my hair was just like at the salon with no frizz.
"I used this in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, where electricity is very poorly done and is very weak. I never blew a fuse and was absolutely amazed!"
"The only hair dryer manufactured with the vents on the side.  This is essential for my work, the newer backk vent ones are worthless to me."
"Well, I cannot say enough about this product.  As other customers have also stated, I bought it for travel and now use it every day.  You will not be disappointed."
I just received my dryer 7-19-2013 luv it.. I have thick hair and needed a blow dryer that can do the job this dryer straigthens my hair something kinda serious.. I would recommend it..
i use it to dry my hair.What a  stupid question or do you have other uses for a wall hanging hair dryer
Small but packs some serious heat and power!
Purchased this because my daughter hated the loud hair dryer we had. This one is quite a bit quieter and well made.
i bought the &#34;used&#34;/open box item - no idea what was wrong with it - it looked like i got it off of the store shelf.
"I been using Conair hair dryers for years, but this one is the worst hair Dryer I ever used.  It burns your hair. I didn't have the box anymore, or I would have returned it."
Works great!

I would buy it again (for that price)."

They are the best on the market :-)  I would purchase again.  We did put one in our 5th wheel bathroom also."
"I have 2 other blow dryers, and I will be selling them.  This dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever had. It is really awesome this is why I gave it a 5. I would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own."

"This is an awesome blow drier.  I'm going to buy it and give it to my girlfriends for gifts, you really can't beat the price for the quality you get.  I first tried it in an upscale day spa in Chicago.  I had to call the place to find out the brand and model because that was the best hair day of my life to date.  Now my hair is shiny and frizz-free every day.  I couldn't be happier."

This hair dryer does a very good job. It has multiple settings for heat and fan speed. Very good value.

Does its job at a great price. It's also extremely light weight as well so I carry it in my carry-on bag when I travel.
Love not having to store a hair dryer and so far the Conair is operating GREAT!  It's also a great weight and wattage for drying your hair.
Compact and powerful.<br />This hairdryer works great on 220 V in Europe- it has both &#34;low&#34; and &#34;high&#34; setting available.
This is a great hairdryer for the money. It's light weight and has a cleanable filter which should extend the life of the dryer.
This blowdryer is amazing. My sylist uses it in my hair and I had to buy it for my home. It works for me and my daughter with ease. A must buy.
Nice quality.

The Onei MK-II hair dryer is an excellent way to reduce frizz when drying while styling.  I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair dryer.

Bought this as a gift and my wife absolutely loves it. She says its the best hair dryer she has ever had. And I cant complain about the price. I would recommend this to anyone.
nice.
It dries my hair with speed and leaves it with shine.  It is fairly compact and quieter than most dryers.
This was to be a replacement for a Sunbeam dryer we had in our home which is now working. Surprise!  We arenow  thinking of putting it in our vacation condo.  These dryers are absolutely excellent and we will buy another as a backup in case you all stop manufacturing them.  Highly recommend this product!
I love this hair dryer.  It has great power and capabilities.  Much better than anything I've found in drug stores.
i love the turbo blow dryer its the best the price is totally woth buying :-D it works wonders :-)
Conair YB075W Pro Yellowbird is really most excellent. This hair dryer is sturdy and well built. Definitely worth the money.
The product Worked well<br />I Would recommend<br />I Would buy again<br />Arrived on time as stated online<br />Very Cost effective
I Love it!!!! I use it everyday. One of the best blow dryers I have purchased. My hairstyles uses it on her clients.

"I bought this for my wife and she really likes it, she says it's the best hair dryer she has ever used in her life."
I've always wanted a compact hair dryer that I could have on the wall.  This is one is the perfect one since I don't have a big storage area.  It makes my life much more organized and I just love it.  It works perfect!~
"i was so pleased with this dryer, it gave my hair a thicker look. The volumizer works really good, makes my hair even thicker, wish it came with a comb tho, but its good, and i love it..."
"Very happy with product - very quite operationally. It was a bit tricky to mount on the wall, but that was probably just me."
i am glad that i bought this product.its powerful and if you want you can reduce the power as you wish.its the perfect thing i was looking for.
"Thank you for the great product, and the wonderful samples for tanning.  I now know where to go to purchase products such as this...  Nice touch"
"I was so glad to find my color online, because they no longer stock it in my area.<br />Thanks, the items was in great condition when it arrived. Cost a bit more than in the store (was about $8 each here)."
i am very picky when it comes to my blow dryers. I can't commit. My sister had purchased this item at Target and I loved it! It has great power for it not being a professional hair dryer. I searched for it at 3 Targets and found out they no longer carried it. i was browsing on Amazon and found it! I ordered it immediately. I am very happy I purchased this item.
"Product is a nice beigey gloss,cannot find it in the stores anymore so I came to Amazon"
"This item it's been working perfectly fine, I'm glad i ordered!!"
"Love it, love it, love it!!!  In renovating our bathrooms, we added an amenity I so appreciate in hotels.  Convenience to our over-nighters, and < in baggage weight, are both a plus to them as well. The Night light is great for the grandbabies also.  Amazon's cumulative $ point system and free shipping cannot be beat."
Great dryer.  Lightweight and easy to handle.  Great heat and cool features.
I bought this T3 blow dryer over a year ago and just this morning had a failure with it.  I have loved this dryer and the technology it uses.  I contacted Best Buy Beauty this morning and they are replacing my dryer.  Great customer service!  Thank you Jennifer Cavanagh
Excellent! will surely buy again. Does the job right.
Awesome. Retractable cord works great. Blowing power is great. Light and easy to store. Bought it for our new camper.

I love this hair dryer! I live in a college dorm and share this dryer with my roommate and it's working perfectly!
I really do like it! It is so handy and drys my hair very good. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a hair dryer.
Quieter than most!  Dries quickly. The cord storage is great but does have issues once in awhile.  Never had one that didn't.
"Very nice, compact, high quality dryer with good controls - a good value."
"Excellent item, already bought one. Not too big, good power, good handling, wonderfull on the wall. Very good item. Very recommanded."
Great hair dryer!  Love having the hair dryer ready to use but out of the way mounted to the wall.  We have one in each bathroom!
This is a great blowdryer to take traveling. Has full power in a compact size. Handle folds up nicely. Used it in France wth an adapter.
Perfect replaced old one I was very pleased with.
This dryer does really make a difference in a fuller head of hair appearance using the sonic property of this dryer.  The heat and intensity choices work great and the retraction of the cord is a nice feature!
Works great!  Our camper has a small bathroom. I needed a hairdryer that was always up and out of the way.  This one is perfect!
"It does exactly what its supposed to. Perfectly dries your hair in no time!<br />Fast and furious ,no frizz love it"
"Small hair dryer, perfect to put on you travel bag and use anywhere. Works perfectly. I recommend this product to anyone"
Exactly what I was looking for. Love the retractable cord and the folding handle! Sturdy unit with good power. Would definately recommend!
This dryer works great and saves space.  I have one at our home and at our Lake House.  I love the night lite it has.  Its easy to hang on the wall and looks nice too.
"I'm no hairdryer expert, but this fit my needs perfectly. It folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly."
Wife thinks this thing is the best dryer she's ever had!  Claims it drys her hair quickly without leaving all the static. I wouldn't know since I'm bald but I'm glad I bought it for her.
We love this blow dryer because it does the job under 10 minutes that is a lifesaver for the people in my home. This blow dryer was exceptional value.
"quick delivery, great product, thank you!!<br /><br />easy to use, light and attractive."
Have had this for 2 years now. Paid $25.00 with free shipping and the dryer still going strong. VERY happy:)
This product works really good and the price is reasonable. I strongly recommanded.<br />I will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range.
"Great, lightweight, use every day for past year almost & love it!! Best price too!"
"Great product! I bought one for a gift and one for myself! Easy to use, doesn't get to hot, and lightweight!"
Light and easy to use. Very good product
"This mini dryer is perfect for travel.  I have used it several times and am impressed.  It also came with a zipper bag for travel, which was an unexpected surprise.  It has a lot of force and does a great job."
"I LOVE this hair dryer!  I went on vacation and there was one in my room.  I loved it so much I came home and searched for it til I found it.  Amazon had the best price for this model.  When it came, I was not disappointed.  If you like your dryer to have a lot of force to it, this is the one."
Exactly what I wanted at a very good price
"This unit was exactly what we wanted with a very good price.  We would recommend this if you're looking for a lightweight, portable dryer."
"Dries hair quickly.  Excellent price.  I have 15 amp service, and it doesn't blow fuses.  It should blow a fuse on high (given the watt rating, but it doesn't). Go figure."
"I've had many good hair dryers and this one might be the best. Lightweight, powerful and it makes my hair so smooth."
"My daughter had used this dryer in a hotel while traveling for work & she loved it.  It was at the top of her Christmas wish list, so it was one of the most appreciated gifts she received.  She assures me it is the best dryer she has ever used."
"brilliant product, excellent delivery service, love the finish of the haridrier, I didn't realised that it was American plug so I've purchased an adaptor from amazon and all sorted! :)"
This is great for me because i needed a new dependable hair dryer. Conair products are always a great to use
I had another T3 that died after years of use. I received my new drier expeditiously and don't want to be without it. Great service and great product.
It's a tad heavier than I would like but I love the retractable cord and the fact that it folds and fits easily in my vanity drawer. It does a great job.
ALL WOMEN SHOULD HAVE ONE. EASY TO CARRY ON VACATION OR JUST FOR AN OVERNIGHT VISIT. WORKS GREAT :)
"This is a great price for this product!  If your hair needs some TLC from the dry, winter air, this is a great shampoo."
"This is an excellent blow dryer, as it dries extremely quickly and creates a smooth, frizz-free shine. My hair is a medium bob style and  the rotating straightening piece is perfect for creating a stylish look. Great purchase, I expect this item to last quite a while, as cheaper quality driers die on me after 2 years."
I love it came in excellent condition.  I absolutely<br />Love it I have every positive thought about my blow dryer
"This is the seocnd one of these I have owned and the first lasted over 10 years.  Gret product, glad I could find it again on Amazon.<br />The mutipe temperature settings make it a dream to have.  LOVE IT!!!"

"Love it! The power, the light weight, the settings & especially easy to pack because it folds up! I have fibromyalgia and my hands sometimes will not let me hold things. The grip on this is easy & it's light weight so it doesn't hurt to hold it when drying my hair."
Love this dryer!! Dries quickly and straightens hair nicely.
Great Dryer with a lot of power.  Quick drying hair.  I love it and would recommend to anyone.  Very satisfied.

"I oove it!  Works great, plenty of blow power and love the added bonus of the night light. I would recommend this product for purchase."
This is a great hair dryer. The light is a nice feature. It is a bit bright though as I already purchased one of these a couple of yrs ago and the light was better.

Super awesome.  Dries my hair in no time.  Makes it shine and the style lasts for several days. Very good.
"Its good, dryes my hair really fast and its cute too! I got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well!"
I bought this dryer to replace one I use at home.  It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting.  I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice.  These 2 features alone make it great for travel!
My 10 year-old Conair just died so I bought this model.  So far it has been perfect.  The airflow is great.  I love the temperature settings with the cool shot.  I mainly use the straightening attachment which is perfect.  This works just as well as the $150 ones at the salon.
"This is a 1600 watt dryer with 2 fan speeds!  Heats up quick and is very handy mounted on the bathroom wall, which, was very easy to do with the supplied screws."
I am a flight attendant and many hotels I stay in have this hair dryer and I LOVE it! I had to order one for home!!
"Chord works fine, switches loosen up. Good price."
Good bang for the buck.  Works fine.
This is a great blow dryer! The air comes out nice and strong and it gets the job done fast.

Amazing! Gets hot and works perfectly. The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage. I'm in love 
"I've always loved soft bonnet Hair dryers, the flexibility and convenience is fantastic. I enjoy being able to sit on my bed, use my smartphone while my hair is drying. It's really great and awesome engineering."
Works great and pretty color!
"Great wind, and does not hurt my hair that much!!"
"Awesome product, very user friendly and compact for traveling. My wife loves it!"
"Traveling a lot for work, this is great for on-the-go compact and powerful hair-drying products. Comes with cute bag and diffuser. Love it!"
"It is really powerful, my wife love it! It dries real fast your hair and the price is excellent! Recommended!"
I have one of these already and love it. Will make a great gift. It is powerful & the reel cord makes this blow dryer even better!

Very light and drys fast! Really quit and happy I bought this T3 hair dryer you will be happy to !!
Works excellent. Light weight also which I like very much.
Excellent product. It works as advertised and the power is sufficient to straighten even the most curly hair.  I recommend the product highly.
Awesome in perfect condition the box was a little beat up but the product is fantastic
I've always used KURUKURU and I'm glad I got it on Amazon because it works great for me right now. I don't know what I'd do without it!
"The best blow dryer I've ever used.  Ever.  I could go on and on about all the great features, how powerful it is, and even how great it looks but the best feature, for me, is the non-slip exterior.  I can't tell you how many times my old blow dryers went crashing to the floor due to their slippery casings, but the texturized exterior on this dryer allows me to get a good grip r - and keep that grip - throughout the entire drying process.  The best!"
"This was a definite Christmas favorite...great color, works great, has the cool styling attachment which was a hit!!!  My daughter loves it!"
"This hairdryer is the best! Not very large and fits conveniently on the wall, right by the sink. My husband got the idea from a hotel room and it's one of the best purchases we've ever made."
"Love this, keeps my curls nice and not frizzes out."
So far works great!
"Nice blow dryer.  Comes with a comb too, which is what i needed.  I love it."
love love love good for my hair
BEST BLOWDRYER for NATURAL GIRLS. I Never use anything else
Love having my hair dryer so handy.

"Better than expected.  Great product, excellent delivery."
My 12 year old loves this. It is perfect for her
My daughter is a Cosmetologist and she was very happy to receive this as an early Christmas gift and business investment of course.

Works great. No shut off like others have said. Well worth my money.
Good running smooth
"Love it, nice size now I need one with dual voltage for traveling overseas."

Greatest tool for natural chicks
"Perfect replacement for my old, burnt out hair dryer."
This dries my hair extremely fast and it has incredibly affordable. I am extremely glad I bought this product. It also comes with attachments that are handy.
I am still using this machine. It really is a great blow dryer. It dries your hair quickly. It is worth the purchase.
For its size I am amazed at the &#34;horsepower&#34; :) The velocity and heat that comes from this thing is amazing and puts full-sized hair dryers to shame.
"Just what we were looking for . Compact light and functional. Haven't used it yet but seems to be what I wanted.  Good quality of manufacture, just what the Dr. ordered."
I had no idea how cheap my hair dryer was till I used this one. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and tried it. It worked great! I liked hers so much I bought one for myself.
Great traveling Hair Dryer.  I used this when I went to Florida last month and it was so nice how it folds and the retractable cord was great instead of wining it around the Handle.
"Nice size, convenient for travel, powerfull and light. Dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to Europe. Very happy with the purchase."
I was actually surprised.  My hairdresser recommended a home unit since I like to sit under her hairdryer and read.  A great treat at home!
I was looking for a wall mount hair dryer and came up with the Andis read the reviews and decided that this dryer was for me in the 2nd bathroom so the night light helps and is not in anyway visable until you get into the hallway. great hair dryer would highly recomend this one!!!!!!!!!!!
I like tha it has the hot and warm heat adjustment.  Works great.
"Great dryer... Easy to assemble, heats up quick, heat is adjustable, mobile, works like a charm... No complaints!"
This is really a great hair dryer. I love the cool setting after drying my hair with the heat.  WOuld not trade it for anything.
Was very pleased with this purchase.  The profile is slim and looks well to hang on wall.  It has different speeds with pleases me.  Very happy to have purchased this as a replacement  for one I had for years.  Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer
this is the best!!! works great for hair! annnd my hubby decided to use it to take decals off our truck.... he used it for 4 hrs straight on high heat and i was a bit nervous it would die out on me pretty quick afterward but its 4 mos later and still as good as when i bought it!! very happy with this product!!
This product is very very good. I purchased it after seeing my roommates use this one. It is completely worth the money and it gives a nice blow dry leaving your hair feel awesome.
"I love the color! The grip is great, very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair! The cord retracts. There is a wide variety of settings for every stge of your hair (wet, damp). Great for touch-ups, too. I am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it. Great investment!"
Works just as well as a full sized hair dryer even though it is the size of a toy!!
"light weight, easy to manage does a great job.  Mom is 90 years old and this unit is perfect for her needs."
"I buy cheap. I don't need anything fancy, just something that gets the job done. This works great! Gets at right temperature comes with attachments. It's better than a $30 one my sister bought."
"Great seller and great product, this hair dryer is manageable and leaves my hair perfect. The drier is a bit heavy but other than that, perfect size and it makes wonders"
"i love this new blowdryer, it's just as it described and was a very good price. i got it on time, too !"

It's a good product to buy. it's very useful.
"Works great, light weight, easy to handle.  Just what I was looking for.."
"Fits my T3 Micro. Model #53888 R. The barrel of the dryer is slightly less than 2 inches in diameter. Push in and twist, it will latch and stays on perfectly. This is a great value and works well."
this is a great product! very efficient and easy to use.
Works great and my little girl loves having her own blow dryer! It is a very cute and functional blow dryer!
Very happy with my new hair dryer- great for easy drying natural curls.  the dryer arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
"This was installed in a RV on the wall of the bathroom area. The unit is plugged into a 110 volt GFCI outlet and the night light and unit power can be turned on/off by pressing the GFCI button. The night light is good - not too bright but ample. The unit appears to offer good air flow and not being too noisy. I am happy with the performance, looks and operation so far."
It works. The cord feature is great. The price is right. What else is there to say.
I love this blowdryer!! It has a very powerful flow of air which is excellent for straight hair like mine. Comes with all standard attachments and I think would be great for any type of hair. Excellent quality for the price. I have had mine for over a year now and it still works like it is brand new!
"I recommend it ,is a very good product.i only work with the best ,it worth the money ,I'm going to buy three more."
Came in quick.. Amazing blow dryer with lots of power and heat!
The perfect pink dryer!! I love it! Thank you!
"Great! Quiet! Love it! Bought 2 immediately!<br /><br />Kelly in San Antonio, TX"
Love the hairdryer!  Just what I was looking for and perfect for taking with on trips instead of packing the big dryer!
I love this hair dryer! It has more settings than I am used to. I love the adapter pieces. I styled it with the styling tip and it looked like I got my hair done at the salon.
"We went out West traveling, I took this mini hair dryer. It worked great. It was small,but it worked better than my full size one at home. It didn't take up much room, and it was light. Would recommend this to anyone traveling . Perfect!"
"Excellent, perfect amount of air speed without blowing your hair everywhere like the newer high speed dryers. My second purchase."
What a great item.  So much easier to have this regular item on my wall in the bathroom just like hotels!  Works great and has the ideal settings for my needs.
love love love this hair dryer makes my hair blow out nicely without the frizz nice finishing touch. Thank you.
"Works well. Perfect for travel. Compact, light weight, as good as any full size dryer. Pretty sturdy also. I'd recommend it."
A great product for a great price! I am glad I bought it. It is more than I expected. .
I have had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and it works great. The night light is still on and works fine.
"Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks"
I first tried this hairdryer while staying at a Marriott Resort.  I loved it so much that I purchased 3 of them.  It can be set to blow at  the highest power with the heat at a lower setting -- something I found to be perfect for me.
"This is a great product, works better than my full size blow dryer. And the carrying bag just makes it that much better."
"This little dryer fits the bill perfectly.  It is one great addition to our bath room.  Don,t know why we didn't get one sooner"
This is a great little hair dryer. I wanted a hair dryer to use for both home & travel and the size is perfect.
"Best hair dryer ever. It is very strong and dries your hair right away, it also gives a volume since it is 1600 Watt, the money you pay for it definitely worth it."
"For the price, a very good and flexible hair dryer. The retractable cord, the many levels of heat and volume add up to a very functional unit."
This is a great product! The instructions are very clear and it was super easy to put up! Def. recommend!
"This is the second blower I've owned! I almost went for the newer style...so glad I didn't! I just love this model and I don't think I'll ever look to change! It's a great, reliable blower and the power behind this puppy is awesome! I tend to have frizzy hair, so I need a good blower to smooth it out! This is the perfect choice to remedy this hair type! :-)"
"I think this blow dryer is stronger than my full size blow dryer.  It is just the perfect size and the folding handle is great.  I looked a long time for a good brand, reliable compact dryer with a folding handle.  So glad I spotted this one on Amazon.  This dryer and a compact flat iron are the perfect pair."
I am very pleased with this product and the price.<br /><br />I bought it so I could give my hair hot oil treatments and it has been great. Heat distributes throughout cap and it's easy to use and store.
This is the best dyer I have ever used!!!! I have frizzy curly hair and when I use this dyer my hair comes out smooth and straight...
Best hair dryer I've used. Light weight and dries hair fast.
Love this dryer the best that I have found so far.
Arrived soooo fast made me very happy!!!!!! and the dryer it self is fantastic.

The most light hairdryer I ever had. Good quality.
So far so good.  She's happy with the dryer.
bought this for my condo which we rent out and have always been happy with conair.  I like the night light because I always had a night light in the bathroom and now this serves 2 purposes.
Bought this as stocking stuffer and daughters luv luv it.  Great gift and actually has removable lint screen which a lot of blow dryers don't have.  Will buy another one soon because 1 blow dryer for 2 girls doesn't quite do it!!!  Lol
Installed in guest room bath; and it's a nice extra that is convenient and out of the way.  Especially liked that the cord is not dangling!
Works perfectly if you follow the directions for use. Folds nicely and doesn't take up a lot of space.Glad to have it with me on my European travels!
"This is a great product. It is really simple to hang, works well, and keeps the countertops clutter-free. We have been so happy with it, we've purchased the Sunbeam one each time... years in-between - it lasts well."
Really nice  Hair dryer. Is for a gift and I'm sure she will love it. I like the way the handle folds.
"I'm a hairstylist, and Twinturbo 3200 is one of the best blow dryer out of all brands, if anybody likes to get fast and quality style, this is the perfect product, it's powerful and last longer..... I loved it"
The folding handle and the retractable cord make this a great travel dryer.  Plenty of power and yet easy to store.  Definitely a good buy.  Have used it for about 6 months and works great.<br />2013:  Still going strong; the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly.
"Used this at one of top brand name Hotel, Like it very much, air volume is good with reasonable noise. Excellent product."
Very easy to mount. Even easier to use. The unit automatically shuts off when returned to the cradle. No need to spend money on higher priced units. Very nice product
Very powerful and works great.  We have these in all bathrooms. I have bought these as gifts and people just love them.  Mounting is easy and just plug it in.
Great dryer. We like it very much.
Light weight and dries hair fast!  Super-quiet as advertised.  Highly recommend! This is a great product at a great price!
This is the nicest blow dryer I have ever had and it's very reasonably priced. I am really happy with it.
"this was a great christmas present. the haet adjustment and cord extension were great, the gfci was a good addition and the color was cool."
"so easy to install, so sturdy. I love it!"
This hairdryer works and is easily portable.<br />It been taken to many places since I bought it<br />and my wife - who is fussy about stuff like this -<br />adores it!
"this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size."
I already had one of these as my grown children recommended this great hair dryer.  I just bought two more to have in our condo for vacation rentals.  It is so nice to stay in a place that has a decent hair dryer.  This is the one!
This did a great job.  What I loved most was how compact and easy it was to use.  I highly recommend!
"works great, no need to purchase a hairdryer with a price tag higher than this..."
"The product is great, exceeded my expectations, thanks! Will purchase brand again"
Got this for my daughter for Christmas. it has great power and dries fast!
Great dryer. Never gets too hot.
Great product.  Exactly what I was looking for.
"Great machine.. It gets extremely hot, but it's what I prefer."
"We ended up buying two of these. One for each bathroom. Great hair dryer, not too loud, multi speed and compact out of the way. Like the ones in nice hotels it has it's own GFCI protector so it can be installed by the sink. Save a drawer in the vanity, or get the counter cleaned off."
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM<br />SHE SEARCHED ON-LINE AND FOUND THIS ONE<br />IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR<br />WORKS GREAT
IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE.  A GREAT WEIGHT.  RETRACTABLE!  THE HANDLE FOLDS & IT DRYS VERY WELL!  BEST HAIR DRYER EVER!  AFTER READING SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS I WAS RELUCTANT TO BUY IT BUT I'M SURE GLAD I DID!
"I love this blow dryer. I wanted one I didn't have to put away every day or have lying around with the cord all bunched up. This fit the bill perfectly. It's on the wall, out of the way and always ready."
This product works great. It dries my hair extremely fast and does not leave it frizzy-that's a plus to someone with curly hair!
it good with the cool wind
"Great item, Lots of power came with a great price point and very fast shipping! I'm completely satisfied, thanks for offering this fine item!"
"Two buttons means you can control the fan speed and temperature -independently- which is a very good thing.  This is a good hair dryer, better than the discount store cheapies--but it is a good price, and good quality too.  Highly recommended."
"So cute and small, perfect for traveling but with great power! Easy to use for international travel since it has dual power settings. Love the zebra carrying bag too. Very happy with this purchase!!!"
"Arrived promptly, packaged well - and works great!  Perfect heat (doesn't fry your hair), nice attachments for directing heat to specific areas (I have very, very thick hair), great cord length, and perfect weight. This is a very simple, easy to use, and effective hair dryer at a nice price. I love it!"
"We have found the Andis to be comperable to the dryers found in the more upscale hotels. The hang up cord is a great feature that helps keep cords organized. The night light gives plenty of light for finding your way around the bathroom at night. Two speeds supply plenty of drying power. Nice design, easy to mount."
This blow dryer is awesome! Beautiful. The body of the dryer is nice a soft. Nice material used on it. And this dryer works very well. It's just so sleek and fun to use. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
Exactly what was described is exactly what I needed! Working great!
Works just fine!
A gift to one of my daughters for Christmas and she has been using it for almost a year every day and still works fine!
"Love this bonnet dryer, so convenient and easy storage!"
I bought this product after reading about it in a magazine.  I love it.  It drys my hair very quickly and without frizz!
Favorite dryer!  Dries hair quickly!
It was a pleasure to receive this product quickly in the mail! I'm extremely pleased with the transaction and with the hair dryer! Thank you.
"I absolutely love this hair dryer. Its construction makes it easy to handle regardless of which portion of my head I am drying. It also does a beautiful job of drying and subduing the texture of my fine, course 4C hair. I don't have to use high heat to get the results that I am loving, loving, loving."
This hair dryer works great for me and the price is very reasonable. It also More than met my expectations.
my wife loves it and the night light is very nice.  she uses it every day and finds it really works good
so strong and dries well. love it! i have been using it for ever since but had no problems. :)
"Easy to use, very handy, always at your disposal.  It isn't a powerful dryer, but it works great on mens hair.  The wall mount is simple to install, and it's shock protected.  Great value"
"My son loves it, dries quickly and is very strong!"
"I don't know how it does it, but it makes my hair look like a wig.  LIKE A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL WIG.  It's smooth and shiny and requires no flat ironing, it's just perfect.  Totally crazy.<br /><br />Buy it."
It was reviewed as being effective on high selection and not so much on low.  That has proven true but the product meets my needs perfectly.  It was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.
Have had it for about 2 years. Works superbly: has lots of power; the handle still folds as when it was new; the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new; affordable price. All things considered it is a great product.
Works great @ just the right temp.  Hair never looked better with just a brush and dry.  Love the retractable cord!  Definitely the best dryer I've ever had and at a great price to boot!
"POWERFUL AND NOT EXPENSIVE, IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE,LOVE IT"
"great value.  not a professional one, but great for home use."
"I absolutely love the settings on this thing. Very adjustable and not as noisy as expected. On top of that it has a very beautiful color, and it also has heat settings for those days that you don't feel like damaging your hair. Very good!"
We were very pleased with this purchase. The dryer works good and it is very convient to have it so close at hand.
"I was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel!  I literally ordered one from my hotel room, immediately after using the dryer.  Works really well! Love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord.  Great space saver."
Easy to install and handy.
"Good product, quick delivery"
"I always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel. Now I have my own, conveniently hung at the side of  my sink. Plenty of power for drying hair. Easy installation."
"Compact, sleek and the best part is - the dual voltage that makes this the best travel companion I could ask for.  Did I mention that it works so well, that it takes me half the time it used to with my old dryer. A must buy! I'm planning to buy a couple more as gifts!"
This hair dryer is great. I have very thick hair and it dries my hair quickly. Very nice.  Good price too!
"This is my second purchase of this Model Hair dryer..  The first one lasted about 15 years using two times a day!! So, I was happy to find that they still make this model,  very powerful and doesn't clutter  up the bathroom with the wall mount and the way the cord is attached.  FIVE  STARS FOR SURE!!!!!!"
"I love this product so far! The heat setting is just perfect for me because I have natural hair. I put it to my desired heat setting and it dries my hair great without the heat damage and the comb attachment doesn't pull on my hair, it glides right through while it dries. I gave it 5 stars because I haven't experienced any flaws yet. Hopefully it lasts longer."
Got this for my mom for her birthday.<br /><br />It works great and she has given many compliments about it.  Good dryer apparently!
"I used this while vacationing with a friend and it was the first thing I came home and bought!  Great power, easy to hold and store."
"This product was worth every penny! It will work for any hair type and saves so much time. There's nothing better than not having to use your arms while drying your hair. The ionic button is the best feature, which helps prevent all frizz :)))"
"This is very nice product. Quality is quite good, and save you from risk of missing pills.   Very handy and portable"
"Very good product. Lightweight and compact, but powerful. Came quickly and was well packaged.Easy to use and place out of sight."
"THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, I ALSO USE IT FOR STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR BECAUSE IT CAME WITH ATTACHMENTS.<br />MY HAIR WAS DRY WITH IN 5MINUTES, THE PRICE WAS ALSO GOOD AND IT CAME WITH A ONE YEAR WARRANTY."
I love this dryer. My old remington was amazing so i knew i wanted to stick w/ the same brand. Its amazing. Works great and the color is the best part. plus it feels like velvet!!
"This was a gift, the receiver of the was most pleased. I enjoyed shopping on Amazon, they make it very easy to purchase as many items as you wish."
"Have had this hair dryer for years and love it. Gets nice and hot without burning me, speed is good, no complaints."
"This was a great purchase for me!  Dryer has great power and drying ability, very efficient!  I would highly recommend!  The item was exactly as described!"
I am so glad Amazon had this product! It is a fabulous hair dryer. I have one upstairs and one in my downstairs bathroom.
"I have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home, and it is.  No more messes on the counter or sink, and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in..."
"I love this nice looking hair dryer.  It's powerful, yet sized perfectly for home use.  I highly recommend this product."
"I love this blow dryer! It's the most user friendly dryer I have ever used. It is well made & dries hair very nicely, without burning it. I love the retractable cord. The blow dryer folds shut so it's easier to store.  Cant believe I found such a great affordable blow dryer."
"The best hair dryer ever!  We traveled to NYC over the summer.  At the Seton Hotel, these were the hair dryers they had for guests to use.  My hair was not dry.  It had a variety of settings and was not noisy.  I came home immediately an ordered one.  Wen shampoo and this hair dryer word well together.  :)"
"This is a very nice hair dryer. The fan blows very strong, the heat is good, and the item is solid."
"We have had numerous hair dryers, this is def. one of the best. Forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far. Very satisfied, one note is while pushing the retract cord button, hold the cord as it goes in so it doesnt whip around."
Great dryer. Nice and light weight so my arms don't get worn out drying my long hair. Great power too.
"This dryer is absolutely awesome. The heat settings are exactly what I needed, and the force and speeds are great for volume and fast drying. Really worth the price."
Excellent. Very high volume of air. Good heat control. Easy to hold.  Seems to be very high quality  blow dryer.
I purchased this hair dryer because I used one in a hotel I was staying at and liked it.  I also took into consideration that I have limited space in which to hang it and it was perfect.
"I hairdresser recommended this blow dryer to me she said it was the strongest and best she has ever used, she was right.  I'm pretty sure they use this blow dryer in the movie Twister to make the tornadoes."
This hair dryer is powerful and does s great and quick job of drying my hair after a shower. The price was right and it was shipped quickly by Amazon.<br />It is an excellent value for the money.
"I've been searching for a great quality hair dryer and decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews. This product is every bit as AWESOME as people have said!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! I have shoulder length, curly hair and this dryer cuts my drying time in half. Worth every single penny!!!!"

I liked working fine

Bought this dryer for taveling and for easy storage. I love this dryer and so glad I bought it. So nice.
"This was definitely worth the purchase! It dries faster than normal hair dryers. Best of all, I have had a ton of compliments on how shiny my hair is since I started using it!"
"I ordered this hair dryer for my sister and wasn't sure it would be a good one. It seemed cheap but I ended liking it better than mine, which cost twice as much! It's very light weight and not very loud at all. Since it isn't very loud, I didn't expect it to be very powerful but it dries my hair much faster than most hair dyers I've used. We've had it for over 6 months now and it's still working great! It's definitely a great hair dryer at a great price!"
"This is very good. I like it. I can select strong, wild, hot and cool style. awesome!"
Love it! Excellent product. Very good power as I expected since it is a professional product . I hope lasts forever as if used in a salon
"Though has standard features, the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless, almost as light as a feather, love it!"
worked great!!!!!!!!!!!!  better then my other ones and i had a lot of them ranging from 10- 100$$$ this one is the best so far!!
"Very good for my granddaughter's thick,course,and natural  hair without putting a perm in it."
Just get it! O_O that's how good it is.... no words can explain how well this thing works. I love mine! Had my eyes on it for years now and now that I have it.....I'm very pleased and glad that I bought it.
"I love love love this hair dryer. I have had it for quite a while, and it has been amazing. Great for blowing my hair straight, never burns, and dries very quickly."
This product is just perfect for the teen I purchased it for...she's really in to primping and this saves time and is easy to use! Love it!!
"Works great on my fine hair, lots of air, love the heat settings, and the pattern is fun."
I've been using this dryer for over 10 years (or close)! It has the best power and can get my hair straight or can diffuse it exactly how I want it with the settings. Will continue buying if anything ever happens to it!
I love this one! Great purchase. It drys my hair super fast!
"Our old dryer died and we decided to try this one for the ionic system. The dryer is very fast, has mutiple settings and my wife who didn't like hair dryers, because she has very fine hair, really likes this one and uses it. It does a very good job and this model seems perfect to me."

I tried this hair dryer in a very upscale marriott hotel and was so impressed I came home and purchased. Lightweight and powerful.
"Perfect. Great price, great size. It was a gift and she loved it so much. 100% recomended. The only thing was that the box was too big for it."
My wife and daughter love this. Best blow dryer ever. Worth the money. Hair feels nice and soft after using this.
"It was a present for sis in law for her bday. She loves doing hair, she loved it. !!!!!! :)"
I don't think i'll ever be able to use a regular blow dryer again.  This one is the best ever.
love it
Compact for travel and very powerful.can't beat it for the price. Recommend it for anyone looking for a travel hairdryer or enen great for home use.
Haven't used it yet. The packaging is great and compare to the price I have seen for the same make and model it is good.
"Very good! I use it everyday, and it has worked very well for 5 months. The price is attractive! The protective switch is convenient."
"Reasonably priced and powerful, one of the best in the same class, impressed with the separate control of speed and temp for this price"
It's great!! It's kinda loud but a great product!! Would buy another. Loved the red! The cord goes back up the dryer. Loved that feature.
Purchased this item for travel and it has proved to be a very good choice!  Would definitely recommend to others
"Perfect for use in our motor home, hooked on the wall next to the sink, don't have to dig for it under the sink."

"This is a great hair dryer for the price, and was sent out and delivered to my house ultra fast."
Love it love it love it.  The hair dryer with attachment works great and dries my hair fast.  Buying one for my sister
"I like simple, lightweight and efficient and this was perfect.  Like the lighter heat option for finer hair like mine."
Fully trust in the brand and the model powerful and good
Does it's job. Temperature settings are awesome. You won't regret buying it. I havent tried in any of the extra style dryer.
"This is a a wonderful dryer, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. Why didn't I buy it earlier?"
"I moved to USA recently, and needed everything for my house. This dryer was a perfect combination of price and quality."
love this blow dryer had the red one before but the wiring was cut.. this one is stronger<br />works great... good price
just okay aaa a  a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just wanna finished this
Great for at home or salon used! I gave it as a present to one of my clients that needed a dryer!
"IT WORKS PERFECT.  it is a really cheap product. It is lake a professional hair dryer, with AC motor, 2200 W and tourmalina."
"Next best thing to being at the hair salon.  Have not had a chance to use much, but worked great the 2 times I used.."
"This was a gift for my sister, and it was a great buy for the price. A very well made hair dryer."
"This is an item that my girlfriend requested on her wishlist, and i got it for her. She loves it, and apparently it is amazing. I am bald now, so I have no need for such things, but it's nice to know I bought her something that is great at drying the hair one might have."
My wife had one of these for years and it finaly quit<br />Bought this one and She loves it. She loves it I Love it
I bought two of these for ourrental beach cottage so renters wouldn't have to use up space.  I just bought a third one.  I've used it myself while staying at the beach cottage and it's great!!
"Christmas Present for my wife.<br />I now know more about Hair dryers than I ever hoped to know, but she loves it and that is all that matters. She says it is the best she has ever owned."
One of these is in the employee bathroom at work and I'd used it and decided I wanted one at home.  I love that it's mounted on the wall and out of the way.  Works well for what I need.
Bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  It was just what she wanted.  It had everything that she wanted and more.
"This unit is quieter than others I have, and dries my hair faster--seems to have good power. I also find it comfortable to hold and the switches work smoothly."
I am really enjoying the hair dryer and enjoy the wall mount so it hangs out of the way nicely.
"I prefer woven floss, but could not find on shelves anywhere.  So glad to be weaving again instead of waxing."
I bought this for my wife just before a trip to Greece.  It worked flawlessly both here and there.  She combined it with a universal plug system from AAA and found no flaws on either in the US or in Europe.
I love this product.  My hairdresser told me to buy it and I couldn't be happier.
"only problem (?) is it takes some pressure to release the button for the cord to recoil, but that is about it. i like it and it works great!"
We were traveling and in one hotel my husband commented this wall mount hair dryer is great!  Next morning I ordered one from Amazon.  It arrived 3 days later and he is a happy man!
"Really good quality, l liked it so much l bought 4,"
No bells and whistles on this hairdryer - just an excellent product. Very powerful and light to hold. It arrived very promptly and I recommend it.
My wife really LOVES this dryer. It was easy to put together and works Great. It dries her long hair just the way she likes it. She's Happy.. I'm Happy.
Great size and powerful air.  The tools that come with it are very useful and for me don't have a problem staying on.
"Handy & convenient.  Love the cord hanger, I use it to hang my flat iron.  Very good product for the cost."
"Great dryer,  works extremely well,,,,  love the automatic rewind.... works great, just follow the directions.....Very satisfied with this dryer."
"This is a great, great blow dryer. It straightens my hair better than any other blow dryer I've owned. I love it."
This hair dryer is light and easy to use.  It met my expectations for drying medium length hair.  Very pleased.
"Excellent... A++.+.+.++++++.  It works perfect and is very hot to dry hair.  Excellent article, very low price and ussesfull. Thanks"
Very easy to install<br />Works great and the led light is great.<br />It looks very neat on the wall.<br />The different settings are perfect.
"Bought this for my wife and she LOVES it.  She says it works better than any other hair dryer she has ever owned.  My wife is happy, so I am happy."
This is the best hairdryer I've ever owned!  Puts Conair and Revlon hairdryers to shame.  Time to look at other Remington products.  Finding quality these days is rare.  Happy with my purchase.
"I'm just a guy and my needs for a good hairdryer are the following:<br />Good airflow<br />Quiet<br />Drys the hair quickly<br />This hair dryer meets all three, plus the price is right."
its really amazing! i tried lots of hair products to rescue my sensitive hair and nothing works better than this hair dryer!
Absolutely loved it!  Ordered a second one  I liked it so well.
Excellent in every way! Was originally concerned about replacing a professional hair dryer with this one and couldn't be happier.
"It's nice to buy a product that actully performs exactly as it was described in the marketing materials. There's definitely some valid technology that keeps your hair from frizzing out. Very happy with this unit. So far, this is the best hair dryer I've ever used."
"It is beautiful, I ordered a white one, I really like this color!  The size is good and it has really nice design. I got it on time. I love it so much. It is easy to take!"
"Perfect size, for home or travel.  It's not too small or too bulky or large.  It puts out the perfect amount of heat and air."
"Was concerned about purple color, but it is not bad, it is a darker purple that looks more regal than gouche. The blow dryer itself is powerful and effective. Good buy."
Perfect size for travel. It works better than any hotel wall mounted blower I've tried---It is quite powerful for its size---not like a regular size blower of course. Over all I am very pleased
Super Deal.  Super Price.  I bought this on Amazon after reading reviews.  It works great.  I have no complaints whatsoever.
"Love it.  Keeps counter space clean, but yet the dryer is handy to use."
Great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one. Heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast
Great hair dryer.  Fast and hot.  Good quality product.
So far so good!
Arrived when it was supposed to. Dries my hair super fast. Nice feel to the dryer. Great price. What more can you ask for?
very nice and functional hair dryer.  Easy to mount and easy to use; powerful without harming hair.
Dryer works great and it easy to use and the built in night light in really a nice addition.  I really like this item
I use it everyday. It works great. No problems. Good Price. I got one for every bathroom.  Good power. easy buy.
Use it at home as your &#34;go to&#34; hairdryer or bring it with you on trips.  So light & easy with lots of power.  Love the color too!
Love this !!! Exactly what I was needing and wanting ! It's fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel
"This is a great little hair dryer.  I like that it has three heat settings which are useful when wanting my hair to be straighter or have more curl.  I was hesitant about the retractable cord, but it works great and I have not had any issues with this dryer at all, Good purchase."
Love it. Heats up good. Fast delivery. Easy set up!
the review was great. High Power!!!! Great Heat. Would reccomend this product to all..Perfect Wall mount Hair Dryer.. Quiet and easy to install.
I love this hair dryer! It comes with two attachments which help keep the heat damage to hair at a minimum. The design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. It heats evenly and does a fantastic job. It is high quality for a great price. I recommend this product.
Very pleased with this purchase. The different heat settings is great.
Perfect size for the small suitcase I had to use for a trip to Italy.  It has good power and works well.
"First used one of these in a hotel, and loved it.. the retractable cord gets stuck , but still love it"
First discovered this at a hotel we were staying at and was impressed by the output so much that we ordered one before we checked out.
I tried this blow dryer at a hotel and loved it. I ordered it when I got home and was not disappointed. This blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently!
"Bang for the buck. Bought this for my wife, since she was struggling with a spaced out hair dryer that she's been using for many years. This worked perfectly, would recommend for anyone who doesn't like a change, although it long overdue. Lives up to the expectations"
This dryer works great and has a lot of power. For $10.00?!? You can't beat that!  It's also a  bit smaller than most dryers so it's easy to hold and maneuver.
This is the best gift my sis says she loves it thanks for this product it is a winner. Thanks again!
Great hair dryer that has lasted me 5+ years and it is still going strong. The heat and power settings make this hair dryer very versatile for many hair styles.
Used one of these in a hotel and liked it so much we came home and ordered one.  It was delivered quickly and in great condition.
"I used one of these at the Marriot, and I loved it so much that I had to have one!  Love the power that it has and the folding handle."
This hair dryer was all it was advertised to be.  It is very easy to use and light weight.
"I love Andis products. They all tend do a great job heating up quickly and drying and straightening your hair.<br />Also, their flat irons are great as well."
"Very good product, I've been using it for half a year, works good."
"Had no idea this hair dryer had a retractable cord!! I was very excited to see that. Works great, but it makes our apartment fuse blow every time I use it more than 10-15 minutes (might just be our place but we live in a townhome)."
Great hairdryer! I love the multi settings to dry your hair and it was exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my daughter.  She wanted the Ion tool so it was perfect for her. Thanks.
great  I used this at a Marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home.  I bought one for myself and now my hair looks good all of the time.  thanks.
"great dryer,quite, does the job. the best dryer i have ever used. my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work."
"Great product, highly recommended."
This product runs quieter than I'd imagined and works absolutely great. Highly recommended.
I highly recommend this product because it does<br />work great.
"I love this item!!!! Not only is pink my favorite color but one of my close friends is fighting cancer, so it serves 2 purposes but it also work great!!!! thank u!!!!"
"Awesome product, pretty much as described. does exactly what it's supposed to do. If you want a good ceramic product, then this is it for you."
E eReally worth the money paid I'm happy with the product a must buy my top list loved it wow
Amazing dryer!! It has cut my drying time down significantly. I have really curly hair & this dryer works very well with my diffuser. I think it is a great value for the money and I'm so happy with my purchase!
"Bargain price for a great hairdryer - several heat and speed settings, dries your hair quickly! Haven't used the diffuser yet but it is looks good."
"I was so lucky to find this wonderful dryer with diffuser, You see I had one for 20 years, and it finally blew up, I had loved it so much I had to find another one, I was so happy with my purchase. I use it about 10 to 15 times a day, I am a professional hairdresser and have to have good equipment. Thank you for my dryer."
Great product.  Wasn't sure if I could find one of these type hair dryers again.  It was requested by one of our senior residents that live in the residential facility I work at.
I used it in New Zealand and Australia and it worked great with plenty of heat and power. I was glad to have the voltage change switch.
"Have used this for many years and can't live without it. Happy to have found it, will continue ordering it whenever needed.<br />Thanks."
I love the blow dryer it works great. it was a little heavier than I thought it would be but is great.
"Great dryer, easy to hold, made really well, drys hair in no time at all"
I had a really old hair dryer.  So this one to me is awesome!!  It's not too noisy and it dries my hair quickly.
Super nice hair dryer:)
"Powerful dryer and easy to install, at a good price.  Keeps the cord off the counter and frees up counter space."
This Conair 1875 watt turbo style dryer really does do a great job ob drying my hair. Very quick and efficient.
I love the cooling blow drying feature. I don't have to spend hours to get my hair dry. A great buy!
I have had a couple of these over the years.  They've been great.  Lasted a long time.  Easy to mount.  Great night light too.
Very light and has strong power
This is a very nice hair dryer. I like the size. It has a high and low heat which is very comfortable.  It's not too noisy which is nice.  It can be cleaned too which is very easy. The price is very good I have bought others at twice the price and only half as good! Very happy with it.
Works great!  Love the retractable cord!!  It does go back in fast so I hang on the the plug (lightly) until its retracted so the plug doesn't swing around and hit something.
"I am a retired hairdresser ,for years I have found that Revlon blow dryers just keep going, this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out.I have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around, having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath. Very happy with the quality and durabilty."
"I am very happy with this hair dryer. I must agree with others, though, the night light is very bright. I read other reviewers who said it was bright, but I couldn't imagine such a small light being so bright. My dryer is in a bathroom off the bedroom and it lights up all the bathroom and part of the bedroom. I covered the light with 2 thickness of duck tape and it is still very bright. I like having the night light, but it could be a &#34;bit&#34; dimmer. The dryer works fine and I like having a place to hang the cord on the dryer so it doesn't lay on the sink. That is a great feature."
I never realized how much difference a good hair dryer makes on your hair!! I'm a cancer survivor and have been growing out my hair.  I needed a new hair dryer and I didn't want another one from the drugstore.  I started researching hair dryers on the internet and kept reading about the Onei hair dryer. I love the different settings and it's light weight in your hand. Just wish it had a retractable cord. It's a great medium priced product.  You certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the Onei is perfect!!
Best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time
This item is great!<br />Great price and the best thing I like is that I'll be able to use it any where in the world. Thanks much
Pretty good for a home device
Works so good I bought another one when my wife decided to take the first one with her to her exercise class each morning.
"Use it every time I wash my hair. Pretty good. It's been a while, works without problem."
Love it! Works great and is do quiet!
best hair dryer ever!!!! i didnt care that much abt a hair dryer so most of time my hair was fuzzy. this hair dryer really works with its function choices.
I like it the cool button is a nice feature.
Amazing blow dryer. Almost like a professional kind and for an amazing price.
"Loved this hair dryer--did not make the bathroom hot.  Lasted 2 years, then it wouldn't turn on and had to replace"
Great.  Basic hair dryer but it does a great job and has all the connectors. Worth the buy
Perfect hairdryer! I'm glad I found this on Amazon for an amazing price. I plan on buying a few for Gifts to give out.
Wonderful product. Very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price. WNC
"have been using now for 2 weeks. good quality, blows plenty  of hot air. the cord winds well into the dryer"
It works so nice and does not take up much space. We love it. The tow speed also is really nice
I bought one of these for traveling and my stepmom was visiting and she used it and loved it so much she wanted one for herself so I ordered her one as well! She  loves the power and it's lightweight.
"Since I use this every day, it needs to be a good, reliable product. And that's exactly what it is."
"If you are looking for a good quality hair dryer without too many hairstyle requirements.It is a good choice. You have different choices of heat. Anyway, it meets my requirement."
This one taught me the error of my ways.  Power/ drying much better.  Sturdy construction and really nice texture. too - won't slide off the counter.  Very much worth a bit more money to get a quality piece of equipment.
"This hairdryer is the lightest and quietest I've ever used.  In fact, my husband now wants one of his own!"
"i like it  ,work very good,i will recommend it yo my friends,I'm sure they will love it like me+  good price."
"I ordered this dryer for my sister and she loved it, it was exactly as the page and picture described"
"If you are looking for a great dryer for both home and travel...This is it! I am more than satisfied with this product. In fact, I will be ordering another one because I do not want to be without it. The shipping was faster than expected and it was packaged well."
"I purchased this hair dryer after using on on a trip and it was the hair dryer that was supplied by the hotel.  I love the way it doesn't use a lot of heat.  I also loved the way my hair looked after using this product, the ends of my hair did not look fried.  After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price."
I just returned from a trip to Israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully.  All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  Highly recommend!!!!
"My wife found this model hair dryer at a motel and fell in love with it. I wrote the model number down and bought this one. It has a nice hang-up bracket, a built-in night light, moves a surprising amount of air and works great."
Love this item.  Easy to install.  Very easy to use.  Its always handy and easy to get too. Heat and air is perfect as far I am concerned.  Would highly recommend.
"Used this in a hotel while away and researched it. Found on Amazon at a great price and bought two.  Nice, lightweight hairdryer that gets the job done quickly.  Would highly recommend."
I got exactly what I needed! The product was absolutely perfect and matched the exact description on the product information. Purchased it online and then saw it in the store for almost double the price as it was here - great buying experience.
"I needed a new hairdryer.  The report on this one was very accurate.  It does a great job, is easy to use and dependable.  I can also take it to shows and vacations"
I've had this for a while now and it is still working perfectly. Dries my hair quickly and doesn't leave it as frizzy when I use it with the included extension. The different heat settings are great too; I like having a cool option instead of just a cool button.
Just got this and charged it overnight.  Used it with extreme satisfaction this morning.  My teeth feel great!  Set up was a breeze and using it is easy.  Everything I hoped it would be!
"The hairdryer fits exactly on the wall-mount that we installed for our Sears hair-dryer.  This hair-dryer has more watts, so more power.  My hair gets dryer much quicker.  A very good product and can't beat the price.  I was searching this product and this price was the cheapest."
It is the best. The strength of the wind is amezing. It is light weight. It came at the right time and I would recommend to everyone who wants to buy it.
"Very lightweight, easy to use.  Exactly what I needed.  The attachments and travel case were an added plus.  Perfect for people who need power plus a lightweight design."
"Amazing hair dryer! My mom bought me this dryer when I was 12 im 24 now it still works I bought this one for my mom and its the same quality and works amazing, trust me when I say this is the best investment you could possibly make!!!"
"product of very good quality, 100% satisfied with your purchase recommend this product to all my friends and customers amazon demanded of such items."
"I have had three of these over the years. Ionizing dryer keeps the frizz out of your hair. Cool setting is nice in addition to the two settings for hot, blasting and normal. Great hair dryer!"
Thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price! A welcome addition to my wife's beautiy gadgets.
"We use this to dry off baby butt when doing a diaper change. I mounted it right next to the changing table, and it is flawless. Easy to install, has it's own night light, and will even flip the switch to the off position when you re-holster it when its on! Great product!"
"This is a sturdy, powerful hair dryer.  My stylist recommended it and it DOES NOT disappoint!!"
best ever! has lasted a long time!
PACKS ENOUGH POWER NICE & COMPACT. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS HAIR DRYER TO ANY ONE ESPECIALLLY IF THEY TRAVEL !!
Great product for the price. Cheap and real strong heat. I definitely highly recommend this product. It works tremendously well.
This hair dryer works fine.  I bought it for a trip to Europe but the hotels and apartment we stayed in actually had very good hair dryers so I didn't need it after all.  But I'm glad I have it for when I go to Europe again and there isn't a hair dryer available.  It's very light and compact and fit into the suitcase nicely.
Have not bought a new hair dryer in years and was quite happy with this purchase.
"This is my second purchase of this daily use dryer.  The first one lasted about 10 years.  I was so thrilled to find that it was still on the market. This one is so great because it has lots of power AND the blower settings(low and high) are separate from the heat settings(cool, warm, and hot).I use the hotel provided dryers when I travel and am always so happy to get home to the best blow dryer ever."
"A great product but too much for a 66 yr old guy with thinning hair, therefore wife has happily confiscated for her full head of hair!"
"Best blow dry ever, I have been buying these for years .."
Comes in handy 4 travel or a quick fix it.
My favorite. Easy handling.
"My wife said this dryer is like a windstorm in the bathroom. It dried her hair so she is happy, which means I am happy."
These are super handy. Just like a hotel at home.
Like being able to hang the dryer on wall or cabinet so it is easy to use. Does not take up space on counter or in drawer.
"thanks to this hairdryer. Lots of air, variable temperature, light weight too. Every feature I want and need. Great price too."
Daughter wanted this hairdryer.  She loves it.  Compact and easy to hold.  Color scheme is great.  Decent price compared to what is found in stores.
mom will love this one. Don't need to hold with hand and easy to carry around the country and abroad
She is a lover of all things Hello Kitty and this hair dryer just happens to be a really good one.  Light weight and she still has her style and fun.
i love this blow dryer. it's so quiet and it does an outstanding job. :) my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own.
"It was a great deal, it's worth the price, my wife loves it. It is powerful, and until now is not heating in excess."
"This is a great hairdryer. It's light, and dries my hair fast. I was worried about frizzy hair, but the dryer doesn't make my hair frizzy."
"So far so good.  Dries my hair without any frizz, is lightweight and not noisy.  Comes with a nice 4 year warranty."
I love it very much.I recommend for anyone who is looking for a good hair dryer.  Roseli
"Great price, standard shipping, nice product"
"I liked it, it was a present to my Son-in -Law.  He was happy to receive it, but I don't have any feedback yet.  They are out of state for visit."
This is a very reliable hair dryer and perfect for me by being wall mounted. Much easier to use when you have hand problems and strength limits.
I NEEDED A GOOD BLOW DRYER BECAUSE I'M GOING NATURAL AND THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED TO KEEP MY HAIR HEALTHY.THE QUALITY IS NICE AND THE PRICE IS NICER.
have been looking for a dryer likke this ne for a while now and I finally found it. Great product to own
"I use this everyday and absolutely love it, nice color, light weight and love the retraction cord, awesome blow dryer"
I'm very happy with the hair dryer.  I like a wall mount hair dryer so it is constantly out and available out and yet off the bathroom vanity.  I've had this for a while and have no complaints.  I didn't buy it for the nightlight but it's still working after being plugged in for 24 hours a day for awhile.
"I love this.  It's just what I wanted when I decided to buy a blowdryer.  Fast shipping, too.  Good buy."
I have thin hair and this dryer did an awesome job w giving me lots of volumn. I'm happy to have given it a try. Keeper.
I put this in a rental condo and it is terrific. The LED night light is a wonderful feature to the unit.
"I was extremely happy with the promptness of my order and delivery. (which was free) I am still waiting on my order I placed 3 weeks ago for the same product through BeautyDepot. Haire Supplies is a very professional business who will continue to have my business from now. Amazon is just great with whatever you order, they know who to do business with!"
"Hey Guys, I have to tell ya, i have tried many nose/ear trimmers, but by far the Philps Norelco NT9110 is the best i have ever used or bought. This Philps Norelco 9110 is absolutely the best! If you follow the instructions/ rinse and brush it out after (every use) this product will last? who knows how long. I have had mine for 2 months now, and not a problem with anything. It dose the job of trimming my nose/ear hair better than what i exspected, all i can say is, you will not be disapointed with the performance. Best regards, Greg.  p.s. Thanks a lot Phillps for making an exceptional product."
Excellent! Can't believe how smooth my hair is since using this dryer. Dries my hair in half the time. Love it!
I've had it for nearly 2 months now and it works just fine. Good price for the quality and brand!
love this hair dryer! perfect for travel because of what little space it takes up and the retractable cord is a blessing!
It is tiny and lightweight but very powerful. It is perfect for travel.
Working great so far!
I just love it. I was looking for a professional hair dryer for styling and it's exactly what I was looking for. The heat is just perfect and it keeps the hair shiny.
"Searched high and low for a good quality,  stylish and affordable hair dryer. This is perfect....<br />I've had it a while now (over a year) and I am still happy to have found this.  I really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button - allows me to pack it away nice and easily.  Everything else works as described."
"Just amazing! easy set up,,and it is just absolutely just amazing it gets very hot three seting. And its quite . I was using it one day and my husband came in from work and said &#34; why are you just sitting under that aren't you goning  to turn it on&#34;"
Bought a new hair dryer a few years ago and it stopped working. Wow they just don't make them like they used to.<br />Previous hair dryer lasted 10+ years.  But this one is wonderful. Noise level is pleasant. Lightweight for this 110 pound girl.<br />Love the heat options. Does a wonderful job. I hope it lasts.
This is a very nice hairdryer.  It is lightweight and I love that the cord is stored inside and the handle folds.  It is not overpowering and dries my hair very quickly.  I would highly recommend it.  It is easy to pack if you want to take it with you on a trip.
Great product. It dries my hair super fast. A friend of mine has had hers for years and I am hoping to as well!
This is a great hair dryer.  Drys my hair quickly without getting overly hot.  I like the placement of the switches so you can just use your thumb to adjust the heat and flow while you are drying and styling.
"I bought this dryer because my hairdresser has one like it.  I have naturally curly hair that I straighten. This dryer is awesome.  It dries hair quicker than most, leaving no frizz in the hair.  My hair feels smoother and healthier after using it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Some of the reviews that I read on here before purchasing, said that a lot of people didn't like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off, I don't understand this, if you hold it in your hand the right way, it works fine without hitting the controls."
"Bright nightlight, light weight, excellent heat and air for such a compact hair dryer.  A must have, space saver and reasonable price."
This is a very simple but great blower.  We are using it daily and are happy with it.  Good product.
It is soooo small and perfect for travel. It has pretty good power and the travel case was a nice touch.
I love having my hair dryer ready for action whenever I need it.<br />Conair is an excellent product.  I love it.
"I would highly recommend this dryer. It frees up space on my counter since it is a hang-up, and yet has great blowing power. And the night light is a great plus! No need to have a separate night light to take up valuable outlet space (there is never enough outlets in a bathroom)."
"I truly don't understand anyone who would pay more or could want more than what this hair dryer offers.  It's fantastic.  The settings, noise level, weight, what it does to my hair - all of it.  It's great."
This hair dryer has a good weight and feel. Solid consistant heat at different settings... A great buy at a great price.
"This drier gives me another proof that how Amazon.com helps me find the best product.    Simple design, great quality, compact form factor, for $14 you simply cannot find a better one."
"I purchased this to use on a trip to England and Ireland. I was VERY happy with it! It is very small, lightweight, and high powered. I wouldn't want to use to all the time, but I'm very happy with it for travel."
"This hairdryer is great. It is so much better than the cheap 25 dollars hair dryers I used to get from the store. No frizz (and I live in Florida where we have tons of humidity) and it dries my hair in half the time. The cord is not retractable, but that is my only quirk with the dryer. If you are looking to step up and not pay 100 dollars for a hairdryer this one is awesome. I'm truly impressed."
Perfect size for traveling abroad and the price was right! I wish it was a tad more powerful but I can live with it &#34;as is&#34;.
The hair dryer is stylish and does a fine job with hair drying.  I like the hook on the side that keeps the cord in place.
Works fine--- couldn't be better
"Wife loves it as does my Daughter. Bought another one for her.<br />Fast Drying With out the FRizzzzz..!! Light and easy to hold.<br />Great Price, Fast Ship. Great Product."
Light and powerful.  Great for travel.  Dries your hair quickly.
LOVE this hair dryer. It has great power and dries my hair rather quickly. Would highly recommend!
First tried this at a Hyatt Hotel. Loved it and now I own my own. Great for travel or everyday use.
It works really well!  best thing I have bought so far!
I'm a hairstylist and this is my go to hair dryer in the salon and at home! It's the best!! Well worth the money! My last one lasted over 5 years (and I work 6 days a week)
"Nice size, good weight, excellent airflow. Great styling my hair, and it's really thick and fairly long. Retractable cord is a plus."
"I bought this because I loved the idea of having a retractable cord. The cord works as well as I had hoped, and the unit has an added blessing as well: The housing doesn't seem to get very hot, so I don't have to wait for it to cool before putting it away."
this is a great product I would recommend it to all my friends that own salon it's easy it's lightweight and it last
Love this hairdryer ..... its one of the best around ...... drying time is so much less and it doesn't fry your hair as many others have.<br />I would buy it again.
My wife has tried many hairdryers and I couldn't believe how satisfied she was with this hair dryer...  Totally worth it!
"great pick for servicing scuba gear.  Use it for removing O-rings.  Strong, not really bendable, which is good."
very nice small convenient dryer for travel. I liked this and its a good purchase who need dryer on travel.
"I have medium length, fine curly hair and needed a low setting and warm air and good diffuser that won't sit right on your hair...check, check and check. Perfect for drying while not blowing your hair around so to break the curl or cause frizz. And it's lightweight..a real gem."
"Handy, dual voltage good for foreign travel, compact, nice overall design. This is a great product. I bought one first and it stopped working for some reason. Amazon replaced it right away. Excellent service!"
"This is the most pretty dryer that I have seen in a long time.  We haven't used it yet,b ut it looks very nice and was a t a great price."
"This blow dyer rocks. Effective, for Brand name is affordable. What I like most about it, it is super quite, yet very powerful."
I am very happy with the hair dryer so far. It works perfectly. My hair gets dry quickly and it is so easy to use. I mostly bought this hair dryer for my daughters. They have longer hair and it costs me so much money and time to bring them to the salon. So now I have my own salon at home. I couldn't be happier.
Really pleased with this blow dryer. Quiet and easy to use.  Looks great also love the color.  Love the retractable cord
"I had purchased this item years ago at an Origins store, not even noticing the brand name. I wanted to replace it and when I saw this on Amazon I was thrilled. This is such a great handy thing to use for lotion. My husband hates me asking him to lotion my back, so this is great, and washable which I love. I also use an oil for sore back muscles sometimes and I can use this to apply it myself. Great item."
"This hair dryer is light, quiet, and best of all, the cord swoops right up into the body of the dryer with the push of a button. I love, love, LOVE this feature."
Great heat and strength controls.  Great handling to style hair.  I have had numerous Conair hair dryers over my lifetime and will continue to purchase them due to ther great quality.
Very cool
Present for my mom and it's very good quality for price.
Very good and efficient quiet too.
"It does everything it says it will - nice drying, not too hot, very even, and the attachments work well.  The heat is very even and it does a good job.  This is kind of a cadillac of hair dryers for people who want to pamper their hair.  I love it!"
Works excellently.  Can easily clean out the air intake grill-work.  Only wish the mounting to the wall plate was more secure.
I got this to replace an ancient hairdryer that just wasn't working well anymore.  This is a wonderful hairdryer!  I can dry my hair quickly and it has all the possible settings that I'll ever need.  I am totally happy with this!
"I use this every day and it is a good reliable product but the power switch has started to stick.  I think that a shot of WD-40 would fix it, though.  I have been using it for many years and like the product.  I would buy another and recommend it highly to others."
fast delivery great little travel item for me and use it to seal windows plastic liners in winter. Price is excellent.
"Best dryer I've had, this is my second one...the first one I had just burned out after 17 years that I've had it! Cant ask for more"
"Not too loud, toggle switch is a nice feature, and most importantly... you can hold onto the &#34;head&#34; of the dryer without worrying about it getting too hot. I never like to hold the dryer from the designated handle region, so this was a really nice feature. Good price too. I used to use the babybliss dryers, but found they were too powerful for my hair, so I opted for this product, and I love it!"
"The collapsible handle, the stow away cord, the power of the motor, all these features make this hair dryer really great. Price was right, too!  Highly recommend!"
Amazing! Absolutely love this blow dryer. Very quick dey time and makes my hair soft and shiney!
"Super hot and really nice to use.  Serves its purpose, what more could I ask!?"
"This is one of the best hair dryer you will probably ever find. It is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly. Plus the folding design makes it easy to stash away. In addition, it's relatively small so it's not taking up a ton of room in your suitcase. A win all around."
Best hairdryer I have ever used.  Large impellers really put out some air which speeds drying.  Can be very powerful or not depending on the setting you choose.
"Love this purchase. The heat is just right, not too hot. It sits easily in the holder. It has two speeds which is nice. It great not to have to dig the hair dryer out of drawer,  it's convenient to have it right on the wall."
"This is an excellent blow dryer! I read the reviews before purchasing about how it didn't work right out of the box. Same thing happened to me, except that I realized that if you press the red RESET button on the plug, it works just fine. My hair dries faster, without over-drying. Great price, too!"
My boyfriend uses this more than I do.  He seems to enjoy it.
Good use. It's very compact. Make sure to buy plug head adapters because it is dual voltage use but you still need head adapters to fit the sockets abroad.
Product excelent. Arrive in condiction good. Thanks
So happy I finally bought this dryer for my bathroom.  It has great power but can be gentle with the lower speed.
Makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly. Love it.
Bought one of these for a spare bedroom when we have guests. Took a shower in there one day and LOVED this so much I threw mine away and bought one for myself too.
"Great dryer, I use it to deep conditioner my hair.  I love the portability of this product.  This is a lot better than the bulky hooded dryer."
"Excellent in every way , I really like this.<br />My favorite by far"
Bought for my son and he loves it and uses it every day.  Not too loud which is great.
"Great price, dries hair fast, great for winter days, lots of speed and heat options. Only the bilious orange color might be an issue."
"It's the best hair dryer ever! Love it soooooo much. After using it, my hair becomes more shining and healthy. Definitely recommended for everyone!"
fast shipping.very good dryer.
"I first used this hair dryer in a hotel after that I had to have one. I found it on Amazon, made the purchase and I am very pleased with my purchase."
Does a great job and can't beat the price.  I can't believe the difference it makes between my old hair dryer and this one.
Works great.  Not too heavy. Love the retractable cord.  Feel good knowing it is ionizing and ceramic for the safety of my hair.
Amazing price for a great performing product.  Quiet.<br /><br />Ships on time from a great vendor.  Now is the time to upgrade your outdated hair dryer.
Best $10 bucks spent. Put in on my mirror. Salon looking blowouts in minutes.  Why didn't I get this sooner?
I love this hair dryer.  Long cord and great power drying. Drys fast and styles with attachments that came with it. Hair looks great after.
"I have had many blow dryers......... then of course I needed another one, so<br />instead of going to Target again, I thought let me see whats out there.... I love Amazon so<br />that was the first place I went to. I saw this blow dryer and read the reviews and thought, let me give this<br />a  try (because of the revew) and I just LOVE, LOVE this blow dryer."
Three speeds (noise) and two heat settings. My 4yr old no longer complains about blow dfying his hair cause of the queiter speeds. Great buy for yhe price.
"So far so great.  It dries my hair in a jiffy. I like the looks of it too, and the accessories. It is a 1875 watt hairdryer."
I put the Conair 134R hair dryer on my guests bathroom wall and my visiting company love the idea because they do not have to lug a hair dryer along when they visit me.  I also has a night light on it.
These are on the wall on our bathrooms- they look great  were easy to install and use.  They really help to clean up the clutter.
"I like it so much, I bought two, for two separate bathroom. It is good for the price you pay."
"It's a good hair dryer, works great on all settings also a great price can't go wrong for the money."
"A great dryer for me (I have arthritis), not heavy and does all I need for  drying and styling my hair. Bargain priced too."
"Googled hair dryer, found it at Amazon.com one of my trusted sites. Ordered it and got it 4 days ago. It is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in. Great Product. Working fine.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Amazon"
This hair dryer arrived in good time and worked as advertised. My wife loves that it hangs on the wall in our bathroom. She finds it very convenient. Would not hesitate to deal with this company again.
"I love this blow dryer, helps me when styling my hair. Comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both. Great product for the value and I like the color. The retractable cord is a big plus too."
"This hairdryer is everything I need, great choice for me. Would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer"
The Ritz Carlton hotel provides these hair dryers. After staying at one of their hotels I loved the hair dryer so much I bought one.
"I was very pleased with the shipping and packaging. I like the temperature settings, the way it folds and how the cord retracts inside. Mostly pleased with the handle for holding it while drying my hair. Some dryers don't feel like they are correctly made for holding. This one does. I would recomend this hair dryer to everyone. Thanks."
Fantastic dryer night light is great for kids and two speed is awsome!! Will buy another one of these next time!!
I was really surprised when I received this hair dryer because the quality of the product~ IT IS GREAT<br />The dryer is very affordable and has a great look and feel and puts out nice heat.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and am very happy with it.
Love this blowdryer. It is a bit louder than my Chi Nano and isn't as powerful but it doesn't seem to effect the drying time. Also I would love for it to have a stand but no biggie :)
"This is great.  Used them in hotels in the past.  Convenient, always know where it is and it works great."
"I purchased this for my sister, who has long, naturally curly and somewhat frizzy hair.  She also has cerebral palsy so needed a dryer that was lightweight.  This one fit the bill; she loved it on the first use.  Her hair was smooth & shiny and the dryer works great.  A great value!"
"Very good article! i have 4C natural hair and I use the large comb to make the blow dry, wonderful! i'm in love<br />I leave in france and the article was well packed"
"Quietiest Hair dryer that we've ever owned.  Very powerful, drys quickly and efficiently.  Love this hair dryer!"
"Love this. it's light weight which is nice and easy to use. I have a lot of hair, and it dries so fast with this hair dryer! would def recommend it!"
"Great product at a great price. Provides just the right temperature, and dries very well. Have had no issues with it since purchase. Highly recommended."
"I am so happy with this dryer! It's not too loud, like the design, and easy to pack. The only thing that would make it a perfect dryer would be if it had a medium setting. I would highly recommend the Andis dryer."
This hands free hair dryer is so useful i ordered 2 more for my sisters. Its perfect to blow out my hair to give it a salon look without the hassle of trying to hold the hair dryer at the same time. I am grateful this was invented it makes life so easy:)
"I received this product and am very happy with it.  It is so powerful that even with my very think hair, it is dry within minutes.  By far the best product I own for drying my hair."
"processed hair benefits GREATLY from salon deep conditioning and this is a great home alternative. gets super hot if you need it, also allows home hair coloring that requires heat.  love it."
"This hair dryer is quiet, powerful and hot. Looks good, easy to handle. Very happy."
This lovely boxed gift set arrived on time was a gift and was greatly appreciated by the recipient.  The box is actually pretty enough to keep treassured trinkets in or letters or whatever.  The fragrance is very pleasant.  Very Nice
"I've used this for the last month now, and it is perfect. It does not get overheated, or bring the house down with noise when we use it. It is nice and handy. Blows warm air in the right proportion. I love the multiple speed and heat options Conair provided on this.<br /><br />I think this is the best product out there for around $10. I strongly recommend this purchase. :)"
This is truly the BEST blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals!!! Powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use.  LOVE this product:)
"Great Product, easy to install and easy to clean the filter. Works very well!<br /><br />Thanks Much!<br />Dean Huey<br />Columbus, Nebraska"
"This hair dryer is the best I've owned!  I have dry, curly hair and this hair dryer is powerful enough to straighten my hair without burning it... I'm very happy with my purchase and will tell all of my friends about it..."
"I had use one many times in Hotels, when I found out I could order one,I ordered two.<br />I love mine,lot of power , blows hair dry great, I am glad I buy two."
"This item is very great for its price. I would recommend others to buy it if they're looking for a hair dryer for less money. It also came in time, maybe in 5 days. Normally, 3-5 days delivery is great for me."
This is exactly what I wanted.  It is kind to my thinning hair (I'm 65+) and easy to handle.  I love the retractable cord.
"Love the dryer...salon quality...powerful, but easy to handle.  I'm glad there is also a cool setting to finish off the styling."
"love this blow dryer - cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel! perfect size, weight and great air quality. drys hair quickly."
Inexpensive and does exactly what you need it to...my hair is about shoulder length and it dries it within about five minutes which is great! It can be loud on the higher setting but most hair dryers are. I recommend it!
I love this blow dryer.  I will be getting another one for my guest bathroom. It's very powerful and I have never had any problems with it.
"This is a quick drying dryer, which is what we all want, lol.  The retractable cord is a little snappy, beware of it flipping the cord against you.  I love the color, very bright and cheerful.  So far so good."
Great product and super fast delivery.
Excellent buy! Dries hair quickly and quietly!
"I like it. It's working very well. Like the heat a lot, get things done faster. It's strong too. Definitely a good deal."
This blowdryer is a great product.  It is lightweight and dries your hair fast.  It is a super product for the price.
Does everything the manufacturer states and the price was well worth it.  Shipping was quick and product was in good condition.  Would recommend this hair dryer.
"bought this product for my mom for christmas, she needs a new one every year, i dont know what she does but they all end up going out. this Andis 8200 hair dryer has hung in there and it still works great. i would highly recommend it. its also very pretty in person, the color is great."
"Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  It's a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!  Buy this...it will only make you happy!"
"Bought this combination hair dryer/ hit air curler for use when I am in Japan.  It worked perfectly for my fine hair.  Maybe I did pay a premium for buying it in the US, but I did not have take time out of my business or pleasure schedule to find one when I got to Japan.  I Highly recommend this for any woman who plans to travel in Japan and wants a combinatuion hair dryer and hair curler"
I did a lot of research. This is the narrowest one. The 2 speed 3 heat settings are great. Very nice for a small space.
Nice to have  the dryer right at hand
"This hair dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever purchased. It is light, easy to handle, and leaves my hair soft and silky. Will dry hair very quickly, eliminating flyaways and frizz. Great tool for the price."
Mine came yesterday and it is perfect!  I was looking for a lighted magnifying mirror that would wall mount and I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it.  This was under $60 and it is all I could ask for.  I bought the chrome.  It really does the job.  Thanks for providing such a superior product at such a great price!
WOW! I searched and searched for a good blow dryer and decided upon this one. It was the best decision. I am a professional so I have to have a sturdy blow dryer and this one is that and more! It dries the hair in about 3-4 minutes including long hair! With no frizz! I love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat!
Compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job. I am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable.
Loved!!! My hair is dry in less than 5 minutes. The best.
"Dries my hair incredibly quickly. What used to take 20 minutes now takes 5, it makes getting ready in the morning much more pleasant."
When I first turned this product on my hair was wet. When I turned this device off my hair was dry.<br /><br />I purchased this because I was looking for the cheapest product available. It worked perfectly and does appear to be a quality product. I have been very happy so far.
Love the weight and size - but mainly I have naturally curly hair so was very happy w the diffuser.
I love it. I really do.  What more can I say? I mounted it on the wall and have used it since I got it. Thank you!
"This was the first product I buy on amazon, the thing is heavy but it works amazing , is big but I won't change it for nothing!! The prize it's awesome comparing with what you can do with this thing, best thing it won't damage ur hair !"
Does exactly what i need to do. Perfect! It has a nice texture and nice shape. not too heavy or too light.
2000 watts makes a big difference in how quick n easy straightening your hair is. Perfect for coarser hair types.
"I bought thus dryer after using it at a hotel and decided I must have it.  I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  Did I mention the retractable cord, another feature that I love!  I highly recommend this dryer!"
We've owned one of these before and loved it.  It hangs on the wall in our bathroom so it's always handy.  When the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until I found this on Amazon. Easiest way to make a wife happy!
"Will always buy T3 Hairdryers from now on... best investment. This hairdryer is amazing... and now cheaper since it's not the most current version. I can't imagine a better hairdryer. Dries my hair super fast, and the dryer itself is super light!"
"I can set my hair and fall asleep while drying with this hair dryer, It's everything I was looking for and more. Perfect for get sets and tight curls."
I really needed a new dryer and I'm glad I picked this one! It has great power and I like the folding handle.
"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE WITCH HAS A LOT OF HAIR AND IS VERY PICKY ON WHAT SHE USES FOR IT. SHE LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER MORE THAN THE ONE IVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST,WHICH WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE.THIS IS A GREAT BUY,AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
"So far, a very nice dryer for the price."
I bought this for my daughter 5 months ago. She loves it especially over the one she used to borrow from me. It dries her hair very fast and the folding handle and retractable cord make it great for travel. I am thinking of getting one for myself once mine dies knowing this is a good one.
"pretty good blow dryer. wish it had just a tad bit more power, but honestly, it's not bad. (it's not some cheap hotel-dryer)"
"this one is good and gentle on the hair, however I have not used many so cant really compare.<br />This one is nice and cheaper on Amazon so go for it."
I love this device!  The power is amazing.  My hair is dry in minutes.  It feels really nice in your hands too.
"Seem like package could have been shipped out sooner. But it arrived when promised. Great product & brand new. Used the dryer for 2 yrs up until my lil client touched it & it dropped. Had to duck tape it together for awhile until the new one arrived but it still worked wonders. LOVE, LOVE THIS DRYER!"
Love how light it is and how quickly it dries my hair!
I read the reviews for the many different Andis hair dryers and finally decided on this one. It is great. Dries my hair quickly without causing it to be fly-away and frizzy. Great purchase!
"This eyeliner is the best! It's truly waterproof and yet not flaky, creates a nice solid black line and is very controllable with that nice pointy tipped applicator!<br />LOVE IT!!!"
"This hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth. I always tried to avoid any hair dryer, because they all made my hair frizzier. This hair dryer got my attention in the store, so I went on line at Amazon, found good reviews and good price and I bought it. I couldn believe, when I got such a nice result after the first time I used it. I am using right now for 2 months and I am still happy with it. No regrets."
"I have had this dryer for 3+ years and it's still going strong. I love the &#34;satin&#34; feel of the dryer, the 3 settings (plus the &#34;cool jet&#34; button), and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect. This dryer has been through the ringer- from airports to duffle bags to being dropped, etc- and it still works like the day I bought it. Super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too, the back just screws off. Would buy again."
"Installed this for my wife, to try to keep the counter uncluttered. Good quality product.Very easy to mount, easy to use. Would like the cord about 1ft longer, but love it anyway. Especially like the way it shuts off when you push it back in its holder, and it has a magnetic clasp to hold it..  Very happy"
Replacement dryer for the original one I broke. Love it.
I bought this exact hairdryer more than 5 years ago and I had to buy it again. It's efficient and travels well!
"GIVEN AS A GIFT AT CHRISTMAS... AWESOME PRODUCT, MY SISTER LOVES IT AND SHE HAS EXTREMELY FRIZZY HAIR."
"Excellent product. ... this a replacement for another turbo that I bought 15 years ago , and I used almost every day of the week... I won't buy any other hair dryer. ..."
I love how quiet this blow dryer is. It has a comfortable grip on it and does a beautiful job of drying my hair without any frizz.
Love it! Dries hair fast without tangles!
I love this hair dryer! Dries my hair fast!
"So convenient, seems to work just fine, had it for a month so far. Easy to install and looks great too."
"Great, convenient product. My husband had one and it lasted for years. He looked all over for another one, and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom."
"This dryer is constructed to be a first class item.  Works very well for many uses, we used it to remove vinyl letters from  our trailer.  Did a great job."
"Since this is a Christmas present for my granddaughter, I have no idea how great it is but it has been on her wish list for a long time. The service I received though was wonderful."
"I have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them, they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un-noticable  No fiddling with on off buttons and looking for a place to store it.  If one leaves the on switch ON and hangs it up, it goes off and returns to the blowing setting as soon as one lifts it again. This is great. on a scale of 1-10 This item scores 11."
"I love Remington products!  This hair dryer has performed perfectly for the $20 I got it for on Amazon.<br />I replaced my Conair Ion Shine after 7 years.  Regret not doing it sooner!<br />My hair was frizzing and I thought it was because of my age!  Nope - my Conair was shot!<br />So since the on/off switch broke on the Conair - I finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer.<br /> Plus I never like the switches on that dryer anyway.<br />I love this Tstudio hair dryer.  It is not too loud - which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues.<br />I love the color.  It is extremely attractive.  It is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent.  Goes nicely with my bathroom decor.  OH!  AND THE BEST PART!  It does not hurt my hands!  It is ergonomic!  I feels like a dream!  It is a perfect fit in my palm and I don't feel the switches are in the way at all.  I found that I naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect!  So excited about that part!<br />Was going to buy the BaBlyss (sp?) but when I checked that out on YouTube, I intensely disliked the noise of it.<br />So - Remington it is!  I hope that I get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and I will be an extremely happy customer."
I am so impressed with this hair dryer it's straightened my hair and I don't have to do too much to it it has the speed and the heat that is needed to have a glossy shiny look for my hair I am a cancer patient and this is new hair so it makes it look very sexy and I really like the product.
IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DRYER.IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS MY CHI DRYER.THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST.THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRYER. IM A HAIRDRESSER AND EVERYONE I WORK WITH WAS INTERSTED IN IT WHEN THEY SAW THE COLOR OF IT.IT REALLY WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS MY OLD CHI DRYER.
"This is by far the best hair dryer you'll ever own. I have wavy, thick (not complaining), out of control hair that is usually best left to dry on its own. But this dryer straightens it without use of any additional hair products. I am impressed!"
"This hair dryer is the best.  It is light weight and has two powerful heat levels.  I first used this hair dryer in a Marriott Hotel.  I loved it so much that I wrote down the name, so I could order one for myself.  So happy I did.[[ASIN:B001UE7D32 Andis 30095 Micro Turbo 1200 Watt Hair Dryer]]"
"strong powerful air flow, dries hair quickly, nice compact size, lightweight.  Wish it had a better button for controlling the 'shot of cool' setting."
"It is a little noisy, but works well with strong wind. The price is attractive and it has good quality"
My favorite hair dryer ever!! Why anyone wants one where the cord is all over I don't know.  Works great and is reasonably priced.  Highly recommend!
I ordered this for my craft room to help glue dry.  I wanted something small so it was easy to store.  It is the perfect size and has two speeds which makes it great when working on crafts.  I do wish it had hook or something from which I could hang it.  it arrived on time in good packaging.  I would even consider buying another for when we travel because of it size and weight.
"great dryer, easy to put together, gets hot very fast"
"Perfect for My 6 yr old daughter. Fits her hands perfect, Mini and Mighty, she uses the low setting, the high setting is very powerful."
My hair is so soft and it was so worth the money. I recommend it for anyone--also great gift idea    UPDATE I have had this item since 2011-And its still going strong!
"Used this product for the first time at the Hilton in New York City. Works great. Very powerful & I like the retractable cord,very nice . Would recommend highly.Great price also."
"This dryer is great.  It compares with a $100+ dryer for a fraction of the cost.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon, as it's so much cheaper than at Ulta.  Really, really great device, and the attachments only add to that."
"This is my favorite hairdryer ever.  It's amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this at a hotel I was staying at and couldnt believe how much I liked it.  As soon as I got home, I got online and ordered it.  I have had MANY dryers before this, but this is the best and the best price.  Highly recommend!"
"I'm traveling to Europe and I need a hair dryer with diffuser. I really like it! is not heavy, easy to handle. Is hot but you can change it to a low temperature. Best part, voltage for US and Europe. Just love it! very cute!"
"Excellent hairdryer, folds up nicely, haven't had the opportunity to test it on 240V yet, but I'm sure it'll do just fine. Turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you're using it with 240V, which is a really user-friendly addition. (You're not suppose to use it on high with 240V according to the manual.)"
"Seems to be working well, was easy to mount on the wall."
Best hair dryer ever!  Quite heavy if that is an issue.  I love it.
I love this dryer. It works great and it is quiet
Compact and easy to use
been using this brand in my bathrooms for years.  easy to install.
Great hair dryer. Dries my hair great for thick hair.
Drys my hair fast and effectively:)
"I have not had chance to use it allot, but so far so good :)"
Very well made. Ergonomics is perfect. It has a dust filter that you can remove and clean out. The plug has a breaker switch. The main power switch is in the handle. This dryer can be used in a salon setting.
Best hairdryer on the market. Not too loud and dries hair fast. I should have bought 2
It is easy to use
Love the convenience of having it on the wall and it works great.  It's the second one I've owned and I would buy an Oster again.
My mother loves this lightweight hair dryer.  Says its easy to use.
it is the good hair dryer will continue use it to see if my hair can be better. So far is good?11/27/2014
My favorite hair dryer over the yrs. Great for traveling as still find the occasional lodging without dryers.
Works perfectly. Strong and compact
strong wind
The Wall Mount is invaluable and the drying power is very adequate.
This hair dryer is easy to use and has lots of power. The rubberized texture is easy to grip and hold.
Easy to use.  It does everything that a hair dryer should. I would recommend it to anyone that needs one.
Works like a charm! I love it! It does a great job for the money that I spent on it!
"I use this hairdryer 3-4 times a week. Great power and is quite nice...plus it's in my favorite color, red."
This is an amazing product. It leaves both hands free to do your hear. I have my on my mirror and it has not fallen off in the 2 months I have had this product. I am very pleased. This is also great for someone missing an arm or someone who does not have full use of both arms.
"Conair makes great hair dryers, and this in no exception. Relatively quiet, and generates sufficient heat to satisfy most customers."
it is quite good in shape and it is convenient to use as it is not so big. the power of it is really nice
"Used it for about a year now, have had no problems! It was easy to install and works great! Keeps counter clear and is ready to use."
"My husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall. I bought us one and am sure glad I did. It's nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use, instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it. Loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes. They like theirs also.<br />Would highly recommend."
"I have owned an Andis mini-dryer before and was very pleased.  So far this little dryer works great, too.  I'm happy to recommend it to others."
"Even when a small problem arose, customer service was so accommodating. Very nice dryer. Excellent customer service and very prompt responses."
I am LOVING this blow dryer! My hair feels so soft and looks much more shiny!!!! I'm hoping it isnt like the other reviews and doesnt break in a few weeks bc I love this brand and will never buy another cheap Walmart brand!!!!!
This dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner.  I find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around.  Three speeds and heat levels give you every option plus it has an ionic mode as well.  For the money a very good purchase.
"The dryer is quiet and calm running, the bonnet is is just the right fit with or without rollers . it has a nice handsome look.  It is sturdy and strong.<br /><br />Great temper control the timer has a slight ticking sound, and the bell rings when time is up awesome, coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it.  Perfect for a home beauty aid. Would recommend to all looking for a home style salon look."
A great hairdryer at a great price. It's very quiet and powerful. Arrived very fast and I would recommend this product
"I am very happy so far with this dryer.  The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  And the company, XTAVA, has reached out to me, expressing their desire that I am happy with their product and to please let them know if I have questions.  I find this very refreshing and impressive."
"Love this blowdryer!  Compact, yet powerful!<br />Typically I can't find anything that blows the air strong enough, this is by far the best dryer I have had."
"When I bought my first T-3 I paid $220.00 at a hair salon, i was told it was hands down, the best blow dryer. It was awesome, but after 3 years I started having problems. I certainly didn't want to pay 200.00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair......so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon. I never thought i would find the T-3 on amazon but to my surprise I did find it! I was able to get a brand new, perfect T-3 for 64.95 from discount jungle! I was a little nervous till I got it but it was perfect, it works better than the one I got from the salon!!! I feel like I got the deal of my life!"
"Was on a business trip and this was the hair dryer in my room at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis.  Loved it so I got on Amazon and ordered one. It was waiting on my porch after I got home!  Small, yet powerful and I like that I can control both the heat level and the air flow level.  A great dryer for travelling."
this product has been awesome so far. it dries my hair quicker than regular dryers. love it!
"I love this small and easy to carry hair dryer, ideal for traveling. I will use Amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service."
"Love it. Not to hot, drys my hair quickly and my hair looks fab. What more could I ask for. I'm glad I did not get one of the more pricey dryers."
I have had the blow drier for almost a year.  I love it.  I shut the bathroom door because the light is a little bright however it is great for those middle of the night potty breaks.  It works great for me and I use it every day. One thing that I dont like however it could be because I dont know what I am doing.  Every time I go to use it I have to click the switch on the mount.  it does not automaticallyclick on when I pull it off then push the on on. I have to always click the switch.
This is an amazing hair dryer!  Very quiet but powerful.  It leaves my hair soft and silky.  The best hair dryer I have ever owned!
I read several good reviews on this product and purchased it immediately.<br />It works great. My wife is very satisfied with this hair dryer.<br />I am considering buying a second one for my daughter.
Shipment takes a bit long but very good product
"I love this little,lightweight hair dryer. I used it at a motel in Point Pleasant, N.J. I could not wait to purchase my own. More powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage."
"I got this as a Christmas gift in 2013 and LOVE IT!!!!  easy to assemble, not really loud, and super convenient because you can set it up any where in the house.  not restricted to sitting at a table to get your hair done."
This was my 3rd dryer in about 6 months; couldn't seem to find one with the right amount of heat and airflow.  This one is perfect.
very high quality product.  it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received.  god-daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly.
This dryer if fantastic!  It works very well with my hair style and even if I used rollers it would comply.  Set-up is very easy.  There is great heat control from the top of the hood as well as the knob.  Easy to open and close
"Okay, I have fine hair so my hair doesn't take that long to dry.....I can have my hair dry/styled in about 3 minutes with this powerful blow dryer and that is on the medium heat.  Great dryer with a nice leopard pattern."
Best Pro Dryer ever! Super long cord makes it #1
This is the best hair dryer by far.  It dries my hair perfect without it burning my hair or getting too hot.  The vendor delivered the product in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  I am definitely going to buy a second one for my mother as a Christmas present.
love it! very good quality for the price / easy to assemble/ the temperature levels are great dries quickly/ silent makes no loud sounds except for the timer button when ready is very loud . over all a great dryer to have at home with salon quality .
"Brought this to Thailand. Although there were blow dryers in the rooms, i always prefer to have one that is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly. This is awesome! Compact and worked great. Just make sure you read directions before using in a 220 v outlet!"
"I love this blow dryer and it arrived quickly, the item was exactly what I order. I am pleased with this!"
I love it!! I have never had a blow dryer that was as quiet as this one! Love the pieces that come with it.
Does everything I need it to do. Light and easy to use. I love  the attachments too. Dries nicely and fast.
"This blow dryer is light weight, easy to use and quiet.  I love it and it's a great buy for the money."
"Best hair dryer I have found in a while. It is light weight, dries my thick, curly hair quickly, and it does a good job of not causing frizz."
Very light & dries hair quickly without frizz.
Love love love this blow dryer twin turbo is the way to go... It's fast and it's easy and it gets the job done ..... I would recommend this to anyone
"Works good and outside stays cool.  Durable and heats and cools quickly.  Turbo mode great.  Be aware this dryer is very large.  The plastic hair thingy is a gimmick, but the dryer is good."
"I love that this dryer is compact and really BLOWs the air at your hair.  I found this in a hotel and liked it so I looked it up and bought it from amazon.  Love the price, too!  I have a $150 dryer, which I really like, but it just doesn't blow the hair as strongly as I would like sometimes."
"I got this hairdryer because it was cheaper but still had great reviews. I would agree with some of the reviews in that there is not a very good medium heat, its either too hot or cool, but I still think it works great. I love it!"
"Really love this.  I used in a hotel and seen that it was really handy.  Got one for my spare bath.  So when I have company they no longer have to pack as much stuff.  Trying to give company that hotel guess feel.  Very nice that it includes a night lite.  No longer having to turn on the big light, blinding yourself at night.  I would for sure recommend."
"I bought this for my girl to keep her from buying another Walmart bargain. I can tell it's quieter than most and she says it dries her hair faster. Nice lightweight unit, ergonomically designed. The cleanable filter on the back is a nice feature."
Very pleased with this travel hair dryer. Compact and lightweight and works really well.
This is the absolute best blow dryer I have ever owned and I have owned many over the last 45 years.
Works Great!! I purchased this for my teenage daughter. She absolutely loves it:)
does its job. love the cool sitting and the feel of it.
"Impressed!  At first I thought 1000 watt wouldn't do much, but this Bonnet Hood Dryer packs a punch.  I've used it twice so far and love my results!  This dryer will pay for itself after another 3 uses - so honestly, I feel like I got it for free as I don't have to go the salon to get my hair done!  I'm not saying I won't get my hair done professionally but this will definately keep my hair groomed until I do.<br /><br />LOVE IT!"
"I used this dryer for the first time yesterday for my deep conditioning treatment and let me say, AWESOME! It distributes heat so evenly that when I took the cap off the conditioner penetrated really well! I love it!"
"Excellent product, light, powerful, durable. We have bought several for our kids."
Works wonderfully. Nice and hot and does the job.
It worked fine on my trip to Israel.  It is easy to pack for travel and has a lot of power.
"I also use this hair dryer.  I like it better than the 1 we originally had, but my daughter doesn't think it puts out as much air.  So since I'm the 1 writing the review, I give it 5 stars.  LOVE the retractable cord!"
"Just arrived, although its cheap, it is good value for money, lots of settings to choose from, dried my hair evenly, great buy."
My husband and I used this dryer at the Ritz-Carlton Naples!  We liked it so much that we ordered Four:  two for home and two for the gym!
I LOVEDD MY BLOWDRYER .I ALWAYS BEEN USEING TWINTURBO  BLOWDRYER BUT I LOVE HOW LIGHT THIS IS AND EVEN MORE POWERFUL.
Bought this hairdryer based on great reviews and so far it's been great. Lightweight and comes with a couple attachments for extra shine or curly hair. Get's the job done.
"Love this hairdryer!  Lightweight, good strong air flow, and a long cord!"
"This is a great curling wand. Gives great curls that last for days and doesnt frizz out. I was worried that I would burn my self since there's no heat control but I got used to it pretty quickly without the need of the glove, (wish personally I dont think would have helped much anyway) Overall, a great buy!! Love the color. Also, a very nice surprise was the fact that it indeed does have a swivel cord. Even though the description says it doesnt."
"I think I should give this hairdryer a five star cuz for the price and the size, it's definitely a satisfactory for me. Would be perfect if it could bent but what the heck.<br />It does the job really good with 1200W. The nozzle of course helps a lot.<br />I got the older blue Conair travel hairdryer, can't remember the name and I liked it, but this one is way better."
"I used this hair dryer while traveling this summer. It was used in the US, Canada and Italy. I was very happy with it. It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer. I also appreciate the two attachments that come with it. And, the fact that you can switch it between 120V and 220V makes it incredibly convenient."
"I purchased this hair dryer over two years ago (after using one at a hotel) and it's still going strong.  It's a great dryer - light weight, perfect size, enough power to dry my hair, and very reasonably priced.  I'm ordering another one as a back up, in case they quit making this model.  Love it!!!"
This dryer is amazing! It works better than the shop dryers. It's super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer..me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t.v. This dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble. The shipping was also awesome it arrived within 3 days from ordering it. I recommend this dryer to anyone.
"I can't believe someone didn't think of this sooner! Best product I have bought in a very long time. Love having two hand to manipulate my hair how I want it. I am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror, the whole thing feels very sturdy!"
As strong as a big dryer. This is my 2nd one. The old one still works great. And I've had it 8 years! Perfect for traveling.
My mother is allergic to both amonia and peroxide. She has been using this product for more than 6 months without any allergic reactions the color stays in longer than some of the similar products she previously used. We have had problems finding this product in stores so purchasing online is an excellent option and saves a whole bunch of time in trying to find it.  The package was received before the estimated time stated on Amazon which I also think is excellent.
"Works just great!  Price is right, dries fast, I really like it."
I love the heat - It's more warm than hot like most blow dryers. I feel like it's better for my hair. Very light compared to my former blow dryer.
My favorite  blow dryer . Very strong and fast. I can browdry my sister's 4a/b curly hair in 20 -30 min and my type 3 hair in 7-10  min.
"Works great! So much more power and heat than my old blow dryer.  Not heavy at all, average weight probably.  I love it!!!"
The hair dryer itself is light weight and easy to handle.  It also dries faster than the average hair dryer.  Great buy!
"This hairdryer is perfect for thick hair. The handle feels comfortable while in use and the nozzle has vent holes, so you can get real close to your scalp and the air deflects through the holes. Great design."
I love the power this dryer has.  Cuts drying time by a third.  Nice folding handle if traveling is required as well as the short barrell.  Does not perform like a travel dryer - excellent.
"my wife remembers her teenage days when this was all the rave ...now she uses it after shampooing and is extremely happy ...she swears this was the best product for the job and at a great price ...if you want to get something for the missus...this is it, you can't go wrong"
"Dries hair in no time at all!  Great price great product.  Lightweight and fairly quiet.  I am hoping that this drier lasts many years, as did my last Conair dryer."
"works great  but there is too much noise, i bought it for my girl friend and she loves it very much."
We are enjoying this wall mounted hair dryer very much. It was a gift but we are both enjoying it.
"Super easy to mount. Great the cord does not coil because it would get tangled easily. A tad-bit noisy but that's what a hair dryer is, loud. I recommend to all."
"Wife uses it daily....says it is much quieter and lighter than previous versions, and does a great job and it easy to use...would recommend buying this item!!!"
This hair dryer has got great power!<br />It takes me less time to blow out my hair now. Love it!
This works great and has really helped cut down on my static! Also-my hair feels SO MUCH better now that I am not using my cheapie blow dryer!
Love this dryer! Well worth the money!!  So glad I finally bought it!! :)
This hair dryer has exceeded my standards.  I love it when doing my daughter hair she never complained about it being to hot or the comb pulling her hair. After drying the hair it looked fabulous it just blew with the wind bouncy.  My daughter loved it.. it makes the hair look like you left the salon beautiful. .. I love it...
This is a great hair blower and I can't believe how good it is for the price!  Don't know why one would get a more expensive one.
"I've had this hairdryer for years now and it works just as well as it did the day I bought it. High-powered and hot, which creates the perfect blowout with or without a round brush. I really love this hair-dryer, and I take it with me whenever I travel.<br /><br />Update--- 2 years post review and it's still going strong!"
"******update, 3 years and goin strong, good product   Original review -   Been over a year, love this thing, has different heat settings and attachments, is yeah and it's cute to boot"
I love this hairdryer. It is nice and quiet and easy to handle.  So far so good!
Love this dryer! Had it for a couple of years and it's still going strong. Powerful and HOT!
I'm a hairdresser I have try different brands this the best so far. The price is right n the brand is good.
Works just fine.  No problems.
"Quiet, excellent drying, doesn't get dangerously hot."
Fine product wish I had one years ago.
"My first hairdryer, so I don't have much to compare it to, but it works great for me."
Exactly like photo. Delivered fast. Great price.
"My wife has had this for almost 2 years and she likes it, still works just fine"
Worked fine for me
Its a hair dryer! Works fine.
"work great and I'm very satisfied,Great seller! Fast shipping.<br />Great price and Quality product.Loved the item.Will buy from this seller again"
This is a great hair dryer. Exactly what I was looking for - controls for both the temperature and fan speed. Highly recommend!
"Dries hair. Pretty cheap, but effective."
Dries my hair in half the time.  The attachments are great and the frizz is gone!
I like it because it is not a noisy hair dryer. It works fine and does have a comfort touch.
This works very well.  Fits nicely in my hand.  Good for travel and / or  as your main hair dryer.
Great product exactly how it is described. You can't beat a Revlon blow dryer. It's also very affordable and compact.
Super product!
"Love it, lots of power and drys my hair quickly"
Super!
super product!
Excellent product!  Quick attention very well packed and fast! - It is powerful to my wife loves
Love the retractable cord and the dryer quickly dries my hair.
"This is one of my wife's favorite presents.  It puts out a forceful flow of air, dries her shoulder length hair quickly and fits snugly in her gym bag"
Great little travel dryer. Works almost as good as a full size one.
This is a great dryer. It is the second I've put in our home. This one has just the right power and heat!!
"My wife's blower was sounding like a tractor so we knew it was time.  Found this very inexpensive blower but ordered it because of the great ratings.  It's just the right size, has lot's of power and at $7.77, you can't beat the price.  She had purchased one for $30 at a local store before we found this one, but fortunately hadn't used it and was able to do a return.  One great feature is that the rear inlet screen can be totally removed to clean out the lint.  Great deal."
"I used this product at a Marriott Hotel and loved it. It has multiple settings, a directed air flow and seems to add volume to my hair. The retractable cord and folding handle are great for storage and travel. I would highly recommend this product to everyone."
My daughter bought this hairdryer first and I kept borrowing hers. Finially decided to buy my own and I am very happy with the dryer. It is a light weight and packs a lot of pwer. Goes from hot to cold in seconds. I am very happy with the hairdryer and hope it lasts for years.
the design is simple and nothing special but it is damn powerful and works great. that is all you need from a blow dryer!!
I researched and read reviews.  This was one of the better ones I found.  After I received it I opened and used it.  The hot is really hot - but good when your hair is really wet.  Then you can set it on warm and its good.
"One of those...saw one just like it in a motel while on vaca with my GF a few years back...I thought more of it than she did (primarily because the more things kept off her bathroom counter, the better).<br />That's what she thought, too (that I bought this as a 'message')...which is why she's used it maybe three times in four years since I installed it there for her.<br />It's a great hair dryer (I let mine air-dry--my hair looks more like Michael Bolton's--or Fabio's--that way).<br />This little dryer still works great (I guess, I turn it on every once in awhile to check).<br />Yay, relationship issues!"
"Awesome dryer, made my fine hair dry in half the time, also gave it more volume.  Great purchase."
"It's a great simple hair dryer, works fine. 2 speeds, cooling blow button, that's it. Can't complain for the price. It's strong and light weight, easy to use. I don't need fancy $$ dryer."
"So handy, works great, frees up counter top space in my small bathroom."
My girls say this works great.  Much better than their old one.  Dries hair fast!
Best blow dryer I have ever owned! My 4C hair gets pretty straight using this not even on the high setting!
"Very happy with this hair dryer, and the price!  I have baby fine hair, and I'm able to dry it without leaving it all frizzy.  I clung to my 1500 watt blowdryer for years, until it finally died, since the 1800-watt dryers I'd tried had all given me dismal results.  Maybe it's the ceramic that makes the difference - but in any event I am pleased with this purchase!"
Love it!  Does not frizz out my hair at all in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look.
I really like th hair dryer! It drys fast and makes my hair look great! Highly recommended!
Tons of power! I love this blow dryer! Worth the higher price!
Love it! It has a lot of power and works very well.
A good piece of kit. I chose it for my wife she loves it. So powerful that she rarely uses it on full power (2 wiggles)
"They get very hot, love them."
Love it I use it on all my clients and gets very hot
I like it very much! :)
Awesome hair dryer.  Dries my hair faster than other dryers I have used. I have the matching flat iron too. Great products.
I love this hair dryer. It's fast at drying and quiet. It's a great tool for everyday drying and worth the money. I also bought the hair straightner and it's just as good. I hope Onei keeps making great products like Chi use too!
it does a good job in a short amount of time and that it exactly why i bought this.  good dryer
This hair dryer shaved 1-1/2 hours off my hair straightening time.  I have curly (or better yet coily) hair and this hair dryer (with the comb attachment) goes through it like butter! I highly recommend this hair dryer!
"Loved the color, works amazingly well. Dries your hair very fast. I love that there are multiple setting for temperature and speed"
"I used this brand of hairdryer for the first time during a recent hotel stay, and I just loved it.  It's light, fast, and easy to use.  The buttons are also conveniently placed so that my hand is not on them as I use the dryer.  I liked the dryer in the hotel so much that I immediately ordered one.  It's a super dryer, just about the best I've ever used."
this is a very good hair dryer. It doesn't mess up my hair. Very good product. I would definitely recommend it.
Best blow dry that I have ever owned.  Worth the money.  Cord never gets tied up
"I bought this hair dryer after having it in my hotel room in Disney! I was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried, the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine. Love the retractable cord. My hair is very fine and fly-away, especially in the humid weather. My style held even in the Florida heat. So, I came home and ordered one. Love it!"
I love this hair dryer.  It drys my hair real fast and it is easy to store with the folding handle
the Conair 1875 Watt Turbo Styler with Ionic Conditioning is quite strong... also the price is nice. So I really like it
"This is a great dryer.  The three settings, low, medium and high allow for more flexibility when styling your hair.  My hair  is fine so the low and  medium setting work great for me!"
I love this hair dryer! After using so many wall hanging dryers while traveling when I saw this one on Amazon it was mine!!! It's quieter than my expensive old dryer. I plan to put one in my 2 guest bathrooms. So simply to hang I did it myself!. The night light is a nice feature. I've seen some reviews that says the light is too bright. It's not. I'm going to give family and friends this hair dryer for Christmas presents! Thanks again Amazon I can find anything here and I love my Prime Membership my Husband suggested. He has his own Prime account!
"This dryer cut my drying time down from 15 minutes to under 3 minutes! I have medium length hair - Great price, Love it!"
"Light weight, relatively quiet, good heat control.  This is the best hairdryer I've owned in a long time."
I bought this for my wife as a replacement for an older Conair.  She loves the speed and heat choices.  Very light and easy to use.  Also very easy to clean by removing the intake cover for the motor.  Some attachments included is a plus.
"Great dryer.  Nice heating controls, average weight.  I have had it for a few months and have been very happy with it."
This product is geat pushes air fast and hot. three speeds to suit everyones needs. Light weight. not too bulky. Best blow drier i have ever used. Dries hair fast
"Love it, very powerful for something that small. Wish it could fold up, but still it is an awesome product."
I would highly recommend this. It is really powerful which is handy for someone with frizzy hair like mine. Good value for such a good product.
"I like this drying in many ways. It is lightweight, it is powerful, has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus! I hope it lasts a long time."
My wife has been wanting one of these after our first Motel several years. Now we have one of the best hair dryers we have ever had works great arrived earlier than told.
"This blow dryer is great.  Really leaves my hair soft, shiny & frizz free.  Great value for the price.  Would highly recommend."
This hair dryer has a large hood so I can use fat curlers.  It is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers I have used.  It is light weight and very stable when set up. It is a great product for the price.
Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing was the hair dryer.  I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  I actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from Amazon.  The hair dryer is great.  So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  Great find--I now have the Ritz of hair dryers!
I needed a new blow dryer and because of the good reviews on this one I decided to get it.  it works great would definitely recommend it
"Love it, keeps the frizz down and LOVE the attachments. Since I have some curl to my hair, it's nice to have the diffuser that fits the dryer. Packaged nicely and delivered on time."
"It's a bit heavy but I LOVE IT! I have curly, frizzy hair and it has helped control it. The price it GREAT too. I can't compare it to a &#34;high end&#34; dryer but within this price range it's #1."
"The wife loves it!...the night light is bright, but not harsh!"
"This dryer has alot of power,,different heating settings,,,i was just use to one! Well worth the money,,i have looked around and this is cheaper and a better product! Well worth buying"
I had purchased one for my wife to replace another brand that had quit after two years. She loved it and it does a great job drying hair.<br /><br />I have added another one on my side of the bathroom so we don't have to share. You'll love the fact that it is so small hanging on the wall and out of the way. Ready to use at anytime without have to untangle cords or put it away. It becomes part of your bathroom accessories. Love it.
I got the first one good so I order the second one.I'm happy with it.It's very organized.My kid love it too.
"Good price, blow strong. Not too big.  Love it."
"I like this dryer. Compared to its price, it's worthy and both simple and useful. The shape and its power are impressive."
"Has three setting on both the heat and on the blower and let me tell you, the highest settings are hot and powerful! This is a fantastic styling tool, comparable with my stylists dryer for sure! I highly recommend this dryer. AND IT'S ANIMAL PRINT!!! BONUS!"
"After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one. Its compact, perfect heat settings (2) and so easy to use. The cord is the perfect length. I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam. You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you're done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night. Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things. Its perfect, I gave away my other dryer and never looked back.<br /><br />Get it, you'll love it, really I promise."
"Conair 2000 watt hair dryer is perfect. Transaction was smooth and quick. Excellent deal, durable product powerful and easy to use. Surprised when it arrived early next morning."
"All the product I purchased from Blue Novelties thru Amazon were Christmas gifts for my girls. They were delighted and thrilled at the way the products worked. I'll be saving a lot of beauty salon cost from now on. I love shopping at Amazon.com and I have found a friend in Blue Novelties. Please email me a catalog so I can give it to them. Problem NOW is... they fight over the products.<br />...I can't win, no matter how much I try!  Thanx...Mr. Mac"
"The settings are wonderful and my hair did feel a lot softer after using! The heat setting are great too... I like the option of having cool, warm and hot... the dryer is super powerful and definitely cut down on drying time. And the retractable cord is great! I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to a friend!"
I bought this dryer to make it easier to do both my daughters hair and to teach them how to dry their hair on the type of dryer I learned on.  Wonderful purchase the price was great and this dryer dries hair so much faster than my old model.  Would buy again
"This hairdryer makes my hair look fabulous! I didn't think that it would make much difference, but it did!!"
best little hair dryer I've ever owned
It works perfectly and I can take it everywhere in little space.
"I used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one.  I love it!!  It's lightweight, has a retractable cord and folds.  Great for travel or storage!  I'm on my 2nd one and bought a 3rd to keep just in case."
"This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever owned!  I have curly hair and have found that the diffuser that comes with it is the best for making my hair have the best curls.  I had actually purchased two other hair dryers (one specifically for curly hair) and they didn't work at all!  The diffuser on this dryer is the perfect size to get all of my thick hair.  Not only that, the hair dryer doesn't blow my hair all around when trying to get the right curls.  I also love the cool setting feature on the dryer.  You won't regret purchasing this hair dryer!"
"This ceramic, ionic blow dryer is great.  It has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick. Its the only one its size that has a retractable cord. I love its size/ performance."
"This floss is the kind recommended by my dentist and I can't find it in stores anywhere.  Target used to have it but not recently.  Decently priced online, and good service on delivery."
"Besides the fact that I love the color, this is a dynamo of a blow dryer.  I have been using Conair products since my very 1st blow dryer over 30 years ago.  Their quality is excellent and long lasting.  The retractable cord along with the excellent reviews made it an easy choice.  I highly recommend this product."
"el producto es muy bueno, no tengo ningun problema con el. ya fue utilizado y esta como lo esperaba.<br /><br />the product is very good, I have no problem with it. already been used and is as expected."
"Bought this to take on a trip to Europe.  I love how it folds and how it is easy to convert the voltage.  Most importantly, this small dryer works really well!  Great purchase....BUY IT!"
"I love this product because it does a great job at drying hair with multiple drying settings, but mainly it is great in that it is not bulky like most hair dryers. It folds in half, has a retractable cord, and is fairly light."
I'm super happy with this purchase (already bought 2) and might get another one.  The price is right and it works really well.
fast shipping from Japan & excellent for my fine Asian hair!
Nice little dryerits great on the wall and has a lot of power.
"I dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long. This little beauty does its job, and does it well. There are plenty of settings and options to choose from, depending on what you want and what is best for your hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Update: It's been several months now, and I still use this product almost every day, and it still works great. This is easily the best hairdryer I've ever purchased - strong, fast, and definitely good quality!"
"Great product.  My Daughter uses it everyday, this was a christmas gift and it's getting used, holding up just fine.  Shipment was fast and packaging was great."
"This hair dryer is small and easy to handle, but the best thing is the air flow. Many hair dryers use the word turbo in their description, but this one truly has turbo air flow. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it shining."
"This dryer has great power and really does help keep your hair from frizzing.<br />It's great, and it has lots of power, or little, depending on the setting."
"Finally, a nail file that does the job the first time!  I had tried cheaper glass nail files (Revlon) and the abrasive surface wore off and it no longer worked.  The Opi file works great and has lasted.  I just reordered more as gifts.  Try it."
"It is unique and portable. I love the style, the brand and by using it my hair dries quickly. I would recommend it to everyone who needs a blow dryer. Thank you"
Works as promised! I also looked at it and thought I had received a toy hairdryer- but it works works works! I took it with me on my trip to WA and all three family members used it daily. It is quick! It does not cause fizz or flyaways. The attachments are plastic-but for the price it works wonderfully. Will buy again and recommend it to the ladies :-) PS: The zebra bag was a delight to use for travel and for personal when travel is over :-)
Dries my hair really fast!  Love the product and would highly recommend.  My daughter loved it also.  Product received on time.
"An excellent product. It is very efficient, and, packable! Just what I needed for travel and days I need a fast set. Highly recommended."
"Over 10 years ago I bought a wall mounted blow dryer after using it in a hotel while on a business trip. I loved it!  When that died, I couldn't find a dryer in any retail store that came close to its quality and durability.  Well, I have now! The Oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use. It's powerful, but compact. It dries my hair faster, and styles it better than any product I've used to date. No popped circuit breakers, either, so I know it uses less energy.  I won't be needing another blow dryer for the next decade. And is that ever nice!"
"I have the full size T3, and I am very happy I purchased this travel size. It really does work to keep your hair less frizzy, and dries really quickly. The folding mechanism works well, so it fits nicely in my carry-on bag. I love the idea of not having to use the dryer in the hotel room."
Small and strong.  Great dryer for travel.  Also has dual voltage.  Glad I bought it!
I've used a blow dryer practically every day for the past 30 years so I consider myself a bit of an expert.  This is one of the best blow dryers I've used.  It's light but powerful and does a great job.  Highly recommended.
"Excellent noise levels--very low. Heat control very good as well. Great hairdryer so far, particularly vs. previous Conair models."
"So far so good!  The dryer is very lightweight, which I love.  Love the pink too!  The price was right as well --- all around a good purchase!"
"Very light, fries my hair quickly. Like the cool button."
"This dryer is very light weight, two heat and air settings, dries hair quickly and quietly. Very glad i was able to locate it after using it in a hotel i recently stayed in."
Used one in a hotel and replaced my huge home dryer.
A huge step up from the one it replaced.  Feels solid and works great.
"It's a great hair dryer, light, fairly quiet."
"This works fabulous! Dries my hair in 1/2 the time and works great for getting hair straight before using my HSI professional hair straightener, followed with HSI Argan Oil. Worth every PENNY :)"
Night light is just enough to see but not keep you awake. Hair dryer is great. Installs either with screws or tape.
"It kicks out the heat doesn't take up space, neat, nicely sized, blows like an hurricane you' ll love it.  Needs an man to install there isn't anyway I could 50 year old women."
I love this powerful light weight dryer. It leaves my hair shinny with lots of body. My granddaughter recommended it to me. She loves her dryer also.
I have ordered several of these dryers and have been happy with them all.  I run a salon and enjoy retailing these dryers to my clients
I REALLY LIKE THIS DRYER. THE FACT THAT IT HAS A RETRACTABLE CORD IS A REAL PLUS. THE HEAT AND SPEED SETTINGS ARE ALSO GREAT.
So far so good.
"Found this gem in a hotel in Savannah and liked it so much I took a photo and found it on Amazon.  Bought two, one for each bathroom."
This is my third one in 15 years.  They are convenient and very reliable.  A great buy!
Such a great travel hairdryer. Also works internationally and is a great size.
"Light weight, dries efficiently. I reall like this dryer."
good so far
My wife loves it. A great Mothers Day present
"Works great, fast shipping, thanks"
Had this product for several years and wore it out. Sure glad it was still available. Does the job better than most.
Replaced a earlier version. Works well. Wife happy
Works great - multiple speed and temps.
it's great i enjoy working it. thanks much 
makes my hair smooth
"I really like it for a couple of reasons. The size and also the blower, it is the best I have ever used.<br />One problem, I had one before this order and it only lasted a year."
This hair dryer is light weight and works awesome! I love the multiple settings and the size for travel. So far no issues.
Worked great with adapter.  Just follow instructions on proper settings.
This hairdryer with the brush attachment works very well for drying and straightening out curly hair. A must for everyone with these extra curls! It's also quite nice to have the availability of the two currents that one might use built into this one unit. It will be great for traveling to Europe.
Fantastic Hair Dryer
Great hairdryer and very quiet!
Great product. Have used similar dryer for 20 years in 2 bathrooms. This model seems quieter but still has the power.
"This hair dryer is top quality and I love it. Dries my hair quickly, is light weight and works great. Has many adjustments for speed and heat plus cold blast. Best dryer I have ever owned so far."
This was a replacement for the same unit we'd had for years.  Just a simple snap-in installation.  Great product at a great price.
"Second one of this week, works great."
"I used this dryer while at a Renaissance Suites and loved it. When I returned home, I looked it up online and ordered it. I'm just as pleased with it as I was with the one at Renaissance Suites because it is lightweight, quiet, and efficient."
"Compact, folds,  and has great power. This is my second one, I purchased it to leave at the beach condo."
"There is nothing more to say about dryer, except that you get what you pay for. It is quiet and fast, like a ninja. Maybe they should rename it, lol. I bought this for my daughter, but when she's not around, I find myself &#34;borrowing&#34; it. Hey, I paid for it, don't judge me :)"
"This was bought for my daughter. Mine is about 7 years old, and this one is just as good as mine."
"Does everything a hair dryer should do. Sturdy, nice design, powerful, and totally blows. In a good way."
Great product.  Works better than expected.
"Powerful, efficient and convenient. Can't ask for more. My wife loves it."
Blow drys the hair Smooth and silky
Great hairdryer .the only thing is doesn't have a dual voltage so if you wanna use it out of states you will need to buy a voltage transformator.
"Bought as a travel dryer, but it's so light and powerful that I use it at home every day :)"
Gets the job done and it is cheap.
so far so good
This is lightweight and powerful.  I bought three of them so that I could use two as gifts.  I love it.
Excellent! Finally my hair is like at the hairdresser hahaha
Works great.  I wish the bonnet was larger
it is so far so good.
Love this powerful hairdryer and the compact design is a bonus.  It does not have heat settings but that's not a problem.
Great especially for the price
None available.
"Works great, quiet, lightweight"
Perfect for travel and everyday use.
"Simply put this is THE best hair dryer I have ever owned. Love the speeds and the ease of use, it's not heavy to hold"
"This is a great hairdryer and it is very quiet compared to others I've had. I am very happy with this purchase. I keep it on neutral ions for the most part. I haven't noticed a big difference between the 2 ion settings, but I wasn't expecting to anyway. It seems like a gimmick. I was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has."
"After using this hair dryer at a Marriott on our way home, she just had to have one.  Compact, variable heat and blower settings, just what she wanted.  Fair price including the extra for shipping.  She's quite pleased and that's what it's all about.  Even the retractable cord is neat."
This hairdryer is superb. Like that I can dry my hair quickly as it is quite powerful. Also like the folding handle. It is made for a woman's hand; easy to hold and handle.
This hairdryer has a good weight to it and the motor sounds quiet and smooth. Drys my hair quickly. Love the retractable cord.
Love the hair dryer--easy to carry and take with me on the go. Great so far. Really like it a lot.
This is my second one of these each of my daughters wanted one.  My daughters and their mother say they get great results everytime.
I love love love this hair dryer. Its fast and powerful. Gets the job done within 10 minutes for me.
THIS PRODUCT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN MULTIPLES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  I KEEP ONE IN EACH BATHROOM AND A SPARE IN THE LINEN CLOSET FOR REPLACEMENT USE!  VERY CONVENIENT.
Best blow dryer I've had yet! The diffusser stays attached securely and it's not that loud. I love that it has different controls for the temperature and speed.
my wife said that it works great out daughter loves it too. I also ordered some extra combs just in case.
"I ordered this from Amazon and got it really fast,<br />I used it today, and it made my hair nice and smooth.<br />It's seems nicer than I thought it would be for $20.00"
"I actually use this in the garage for drying glues, paints and finishes, replaced a unit I had for years, works great"
"Lightweight and compact but powerful.  Used one in a hotel and immediately ordered one when I returned home. After years of using a hair dryer, this is myall time favorite.  I use it most every morning and love it.  Plus, it was reasonably priced."
"I love it, my hair is so shiny! it dries faster and I love the attachments, I use the diffuser for my curly hair and the other for my daughters' straight hair, all around great product."
That's what I needed! It's fixed on the wall and always ready to be used! Very convenient and efficient! Great!
"Compact and light, but powerful for a travel hair dryer. We unplugged the hotel dryer and used this one because it worked better"
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She's a stylist, so I took a chance that she wouldn't like it, but she loved it and replaced her old hairdryer with this one."
"This hair dryer make and model is a replacement  of a product that I have been using for several years.  This dryer is great to hang on the wall, saving space on the countertops."
I love this hair dryer. It is so light weigh and powerful that I am stiling my hair a lot faster than before.
"The Hair Dryer it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good i recommend the Andis 82005."
None available.
My husband continues to tease me because I continue to gush about how much I love this blow dryer. He says ooooh - it plugs in and blows air - how special (says the man with little hair to blow :) This is a great dryer - I have longish straight hair - and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair - the variety of settings really work well - and the cool shot button is instantaneous. My hair hasn't looked this good in years!
"Terrific, inexpensive hair dryer.  As good as dryers costing 2, 3, 4 even 5 times this one.  Gets hot quickly, stays hot, works well, light weight, easy to maneuver.  better for travel than most dryers designed specifically for travel.  We love it!"
"Excellent! I am so glad I bought this. Great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after I allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning. A really good and worthwhile purchase! Just want to say I am still thrilled with this purchase of about 6 months ago! It dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days. I could not be happier with this product. I've been around for a &#34;while&#34; and no other hair dry has ever come close. Jump out of the shower, blow dry my hair for a very short time, and I'm on my way! Love it!!!"
Best purchase EVER!!! Well worth the price!!! I have very thick hair and this cut my drying time by 30 minutes...
"Silent, hot, and lightweight! So far so good. Very pleased at the price top!"
Super great hair dryer for very little cost.  I own a $200 hair dryer and like this one a lot better.
"Thanks successfully received good product, I hope very soon make a new purchase with you. ...... .... .... .. ."
"I love this hairdryer. Purchased it for a trip abroad but my gym dryer &#34;died&#34; last week so started using this one and even though it is more compact, it dries my hair quickly. The dual voltage is a plus. Very pleased with the purchase."
"I love this as it never gets too hot and of course it's fairly portable.  I can do things in the kitchen as I dry my hair.  It's nice that it has a brush attachment as well, like that a lot."
LOVE LOVE LOVE this item. The heat control is amazing! Dries my VERY curly hair extremely fast & leaves it soft and shiny. A must have!
"My old blow dryer just quit on me one day so I ordered this one and it works great.  It came with a curling head and a flat head and I have had no issues yet.  Has good air strength and lets you choose cool, warm or hot."
"I recently stayed in a high-end hotel, and this is the hairdryer that was in my room.  After using it just once, I had to buy one for myself whatever the cost.  When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value.  There are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer, just a good, strong flow of air that isn't too loud.  It also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord, so it is easy to store in a drawer."
Lots of power and easy to use.  Fit well near my vanity mirror.  Very pleased.
"I take this hair dryer to the gym with me in my gym bag.  It fits perfectly, and has my short hair dry in no time.  It also gives my hair some volume (I use the diffuser).  It's sturdy, and I'm very pleased with it."
The best hair dryer I've ever used. cut my drying time in half and I have a lot of hair!
This blow dryer straightened my course afro hair from root to tip! It is not difficult to hold or maneuver.  The comb rubber comb is practically unbreakable.. And great for tender scalps as well as the cool shot button! I chose this one because my hairdresser recommended it. She has a wide range of hair dryers but This blow dryer straightened my course afro hair from root to tip! It is not difficult to hold or maneuver.  The comb rubber comb is practically unbreakable..

This hair dryer is perfect for long hair.  It is easy to use.  I am very thankful I got it.
This hair dryer is fantastic and quite strong for being so small.  The best part is the dual voltage feature--it works wherever you travel.
First used this product at a hotel in Vegas.  Bought one for home and love it.  Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage.
"This dryer is worth the money!  I've been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one.  I don't notice that this dries my hair any faster, but it is shinier, smoother, and seems to have more body.  For someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss, this is a huge improvement.  I like this hair dryer and I got a great price for it on Amazon!"
"Took years for me to buy a new hairdryer and I will never wait again to do so.  This hairdryer has power, works great, on the quieter side of blow dryers and really does the job!"
Love it! What a great price and it works great! Used it in a hotel a few years ago and when my current drier died I got this one! Even if this one doesn't last long I will probably buy it again! The power is great!
"As other reviewers said, it is light and quiet. These are two things that really impressed me. Plus it does a good job drying my hair."
I am a flight attendant and this travel dryer is powerful!  Better than any hotel hair dryer.  I love it and it's cheap.
"I've had Andis hair dryers before and they've always served their purpose well. I particularly like this one because it has an off switch. It is a tad heavier than another Andis I had. The night light does not bother me in fact it really is a great night light, although the green needs a bit of getting used to. Great hair dryer"
"Looks sheik, works great, and I can see this piece staying with me for a long time.  I've had it for a year and it's still going strong."
I love this blow dryer... it doesn't get to hot and it's easy to hold and use... I would buy from this seller again
"Great product, easy and fast results. love it!! Fast shipping.. I have curly hair and this product straightens my hair in about twenty-twenty five minutes.. and I am no professional."
I bought this hair dryer for my mother. She is a hair stylist and swears by it. She says it takes up no space and very convenient when mounted on the wall. Works just as good as any other blow dryer she's used. Great space saver.
This is such an amazing hair dryer! It does my hair so fast and doesn't leave it with any static. I will buy this dryer again when I need to!
Really love this hair dryer.  It is super lightweight and sleek.  Dries hair quickly and easily.  The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well. Highly recommend product and seller! Kudos to both :)
"This hair dryer is light, but powerful.  It dries my hair quickly but doesn't dry it out.  I'm very happy with it."
Excellent product!!!  It heats up super fast and is lightweight for easy use.  This dryer would've cost me a fortune at a local beauty supply place.
"For how inexpensive this hair dryer was, I was a little worried about the  quality, but  this is a great hair dryer!  It is quality made, and actually the best hair dryer I have ever had! It dries the hair quickly without getting too hot, or too cold...It is Just right!"
I love this hairdryer and the ease of having it on the wall right there to use
This is so much more convenient than dragging a dryer from a drawer or cabinet.  Hotels have had the right idea all along.
"Excellent performance and quality--heavier than many other dryers, but with a solid feel and excellent fan performance.  I like it more than other dryers I have used."
We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it's a full size but you are able to fold the handle.  It's really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  The retractable cord is also great esp. for travel.
Originally purchased elsewhere for $10 more! Returned that one and got it here cheaper! Been using for a few weeks and loving it. Definitely needed an upgrade and this is a great buy.
"I've had mine for a year and a half, it still works great. Turned out to be a great purchase.<br />3/17/2013 It's been over 3 years and it still works like new."
It really does what it says -- it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz.
"I used an Andis  hair dryer in a nice hotel in Wichita, Kansas.  When I found one on Amazon, I knew I had to have one.  As usual, my order came quickly and I am loving this hair dryer.  The smaller size plus the plug does better in my receptacle in the bathroom.  It fits nicely in my drawer.  It exceeds my expectations.  I am loving it!"
"I love it, it works great.  I wish it had the ability to regrow hair, since my hair line is receding at an alarming rate though!"
"I have bought two of these (one to keep at my boyfriend's place too). They pack well and are wonderful. Very convenient for travel, and dry my hair very quickly."
I had on of these for 12 years.  It finally gave up the ghost.  Works perfectly and is so convenient to have right on the bathroom wall.  Added bonus - more wattage with the new one!
"It is very handy, does a good job drying my hair. I liked it so well I bought a second one for the other bathroom."
"This is a great blowdryer.  I had one before and this one is a little different, but it works great.  I love it!  Compact and the handle folds up which my old one didn't do, which is a great feature for traveling.  High speed - dries hair quickly! Very fast shipper too!  Thanks! Love it!"
"As an international traveler, I love the Dual Voltage!!"
Fast drying time and shine shine shine!!!
Great dryer and a great price.  Quiet and gets the job done. I had a Conair that was 6 years old that I used every day and it finally bit the dust. With that kind of reputation it was easy to know what brand to pick.
Love this blow dryer! It's a beast and my hair loves it. My hair is softer. I didn't realize how much I needed a new blow dryer until this. It's amazing.
"I have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall, so when it started acting up and I needed to replace it... I was not sure if I would be able to find a replacement that I liked as much.  But this one was perfect!!!  I didn't even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware, it connected right to my old hardware!!  Very happy."
very powerful blowdryer but doesn't fry my hair
Very powerful.
It's very powerful and does not burn my hair
"wooooooooooow !!!!!  This baby dries hair in a blink of an eye.  I am a cosmetologist and Blowouts / Blowdries are my salons main ingredient this thing save me 10-15 minutes, (in a salon, this means more clients and more money).  I told a colleague of mine and now we are ordering more.  Hopefully this product can be as good as the first day for a while.    Ps, I just placed a second order for 2 more."
I love this hair dryer! Used it today and it was amazing. I have thick hair and it dried it so quickly! And I used no products today and my hair is so so silky!!! Normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair and I use 2 products plus a smoothing serum at the end. This was amazing!! Great Dryer and a long cord too!! Love it!!!!
"Another great product. You have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus. I hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy,  and it's much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way. I have very fine, short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it's very fast."
"This a great dryer, dries hair fast, no frizz main reason I bought., yes I would recommend this to anyone.<br />Haven't found anything I dislike."
"I had a previous similar model for many years and needed repl, this one is great! best price on net."
"I replaced this unit after 15 years with the same model.  Works great, just need to clean fan area occassionally."
"Speedy shipment, easy ordering, sent just as described, awesome product. My teen aged daughter is loving this hair styler! Thanks!"
"I have very fine hair that doesn't like to be styled. Using this dryer, I have;<br /><br />Volume<br />Body<br />Curl<br /><br />AND, I don't have to use any product to get it that way. I believe the key is not only the dryer, but, the shampoo you use. I use a Keratin infused shampoo with Ion ultra light weight conditioner. Bottom line- this blow dryer is incredible!"
"This is a much better hair dryer that I have ever used.  It is light, and has several options to use.  Love the retractable cord.  Stores easily!"
"shipped super quick!! the speeds in the dryer are extremely convenient esp love the cooling button has no heat at all unlike many dryers tht even with the cooling button, the air is still sort of warm"
"I own three Andis Turbo 1600w hair dryers. Why?  It has tremendous power and dries hair quickly. The low setting is very adequate.  The Andis is slightly more quiet than most hair dryers.  It's excellent for hair health because the heat temp. is modified.  (severe heat damages hair).  My first Andis is 10 years old. My thanks to the engineers!  This is a very good product.  I have owned countless hair dryers.  At last, I've found the best."
"I love this product!  I bought it because the cord is retractable which eliminates winding around the handle or a big tangle when storing.  The biggie though is how much quieter it is than my old dryer & then there is the benefit of how much faster it dries my hair.  Love, Love, Love it!!!"
This dryer is really fast and does a nice job of making my hair already pretty smooth before having to flatiron it!
Own this for a while. No problems so far. Worked as well as it did on the first day I purchased it. Some nice features for the money
"I purchased [[ASIN:B004Q6JL04 Joico K-PAK Quadraion Pro-Dryer]] about 8 months ago, and thought it would be the answer to my needs. Well, to be fair it was for about 7 months then it started dying.<br /><br />So, I purchased this one. I really like it! It is a little louder than the Joico one but that doesn't bother me, this one works great. The buttons take a minute to get used to but they aren't a deal breaker. It dries my hair just as fast as the spendy one, makes it shiny, and has multiple heat settings. The cold shot works great as well.<br /><br />Really is a great deal for a quality dryer, I tried the best and had nothing but issues...so I would rate this one the best.<br />I can recommend [[ASIN:B004Q6LVAW Joico K-PAK Quadraion Blowdry Spray, 5.1 fl. oz.]] it works with any dryer :)"
I love this blow dryer I got it for 10 on Amazon you cannot find this any cheaper matter fact the next cheapest was 20it works great was brand new came with everything and was on time recommendperfectly satisfied
Love this.  Light weight and dries my hair very fast.
Wonderful dryer. Really gets my hair dry quickly. I liked it so much that I bought another one for my daughter.
"This dryer is very lightweight, quiet and it dries hair quickly. The three heat settings are great and the touch is nice"
I bought this hair dryer as a Christmas present for my girlfreind.  She says its the best hair dryer she has ever owned.  I highly recommend.
"This dryer is amazing!!! Used it for the first time today. Leaves hair very soft and no frizz. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer, but I love it!!!"
good hair dryer!  10mins to dry my long hair ! I am so happy
"I love this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly, and my hair dries very smooth and soft. I had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked, but I was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem. Must have been a fluke, but it was very easy to return!"
I have had it for about 2-3 months and its just perfect!!! I love the color love the way it works and I am so happy that it has the different heat and strength levels! It dries my hair so fast and it stays flat most of the times even when it's humid outside!
"This wall mounted unit was easy to install, has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit. The automatic shutoff feature works great. The unit has 2 speeds, however the high speed is normally used."
This inexpensive blow dryer works great! I'm an African American woman and my hair isn't straight. This gets it there. My daughter has curly hair and this does the job on hers as well. I love it! It's a quick and easy blow out!
"Absolutely Love it! It drys very well, its super hoot, so if you are not use to using heat protection products Id recommend you do, just to avoid burning your ends- ITs size is PERFECT for travel! it fit so well in a small spot, and is very durable! Id recommend!!"
Way better quality than I expected for the price! Love it!!
"very good! light and very little noise, dual voltage dries your hair soon."
Excellent! I had a conair turbo bird that I bought back in 2004 that has something rattling inside of it so before it goes out on me I wanted to have a backup. The silverbird has delivered the same great results so far. I look forward to using it for another decade before I replace it!
"Great price for a great product. has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off, i would highly recommend it."
I first used this hair dryer at Courtyard Marriott. It worked so good and did wonders for my hair. I was thrilled to see that amazon was selling these. It dries my hair fast and gives it a silky smooth look. I highly recommend this hair dryer.
I bought this for a friend for Christmas. SHe really likes it because it very light and the temperature controls move easily.
"I bought this dryer for my girlfriend for her birthday last year because she is always complaining about getting her hair done and how much people charge her (which I end up paying for anyway) so I thought what better thing to buy her for her birthday than something she can use and benefit from forever. She loves this hair dryer, she puts her hair in rollers and sits under. It gets very hot too! Thanks for the great buy!"
I have had this hair dryer every day for a long time and it is the best. I use it with the nice difusser that comes with it and my hair has beautiful curls.  I would highly recommend it for people that want to have pretty soft curls when using a difusser. I do not use it for anything else. I have had people borrow it to dry straight hair and they say it is great.
"We bought one of these two years ago, for our remodeled bathroom.  Worked perfectly, so when we moved into our new house in 2011, we bought another one.  Again, works perfectly, very convenient, very well built.   Two criticisms -- the night light is TOO BRIGHT.  A dimmer on the side would be much preferred.  AND, the wall anchors that come with it really suck.  You'll need to buy a set of anchors to mount it correctly.    That said, we're buying another for our second bathroom.  It's a great unit."
"This dryer is excellent for being so small! Terrific air flow & heat settings, not heavy, great quality, and looks high end. It's a bit noisy, but that doesn't matter much. Loving it!!"
Good power with very low noise.  Robust design.  The Night light does the job well. The dryer was easy to install.
"I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in nursing school. she loves anything that is pink and has the Breast Cancer logo. She said this is the best dryer she has ever had,dries her hair in half the time. She said she loves it,and that it is a great dryer."
"I have long, fine, and straight hair and this has turned out to be my go-to dryer. It gets hot enough but not too hot. It is perfect for styling. Very happy with it."
Dries my thick hair quickly and makes it really smooth! Awesome!
This is all I had hoped it would be. It has great power and it is the nice compact small size I desired.
Love my hair with this new dryer!!!
"Works great not very loud, it's hot which is fine with me!"
"This Andis Ionic hair dryer is not only powerful, but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord.  If you are looking for a great, no-nonsense chord at a nice price, then get this one."
Delivery was on time! I They are so easy and light to handle. Just what I was looking for.<br />Thanks so much!!
I love this dryer! I like that it has multiple heat and speed settings. It's very light.
"Love it, love it.  I really like how this dryer works on my hair.  It does not<br />leave it dry or fly away, but nice, shiny and lively."
Works great! I use it every day for a year and have had no problems with it. It looks nice too! There are sparkles in the black section of the blow dryer which is always fun :) There is also a vent in the back that opens to clean out the dust or hair that gets sucked in. For the money it's definitely worth it.
"I have used home blonding hair color for over 30 years, having used every imaginable product on the market.  Dream Blondes is by far the BEST and is the only product I use.  It contains a pre-color conditioner, enough color for long hair (no more having to purchase two boxes of other coloring), and CONSISTENTLY provides beautiful color with excellent conditioning.  The Amazon price is 1/3 of the discount or drug store price! I purchased a case when I saw the price and am going to order another!!!!  What a great bargain for the best product!!  Thank you Amaon!!"
"I wanted a ceramic dryer because my old dryer was dryng out my hair and making it appear dry and course.  I purchased this ceramic, ionic dryer to protect my hair and also achieve<br />a softer look. Itgave the results that I was looking for. It certainly works! Also a good feature it the automatic cord wind. I am very pleased. The dryer was reduced in price and<br />this made the purchase sweeter as it is a great product at a bargain price.<br />I would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating."
"A great little travel hair dryer, very light yet powerful. Works even better than my full sized one. I use it at home too."
My last hair dryer was an Andis and I bought an Andis again because I was so impressed with their quality.  So compact that it fits easily in my suitcase. You feel better when travelling when you know you will be able to look good in all your vacation photos.  Great as an everyday dryer for those with small bathrooms!
Excellent product. Small but very powerful.
This Conair hair dryer works great. It runs smooth and quieter than my last hair dryer (an old Remington). The cord retracts nicely into the handle when finished. I recommend this item.
Love the product. Very fast shipping.
I absolutely love this hair dryer. I did a lot of research as to what people where saying was the best hair dryer nowdays and it consistenly showed this one! I love the high pressure and the different settings. My hair is silky and definitely not frizzy by the end of a hair drying session. :)
"I love this product, it has a good performance, I really fall in love, is simple to use and practice to mobilize"
It dries my hair fast and I have thick hair. It's light weight. A great price! My hair feels amazing after.
I had been looking to purchase a blow dryer for our spare bathroom and trailer when I found this one I was so happy it has exceded all my expectations. It was such a good deal. I am very pleaswed with the product and how fast it arrived.
"Like the Oster hair dryer a lot.  It is larger than my old one, but a lot more powerful.  Great choice!"
This Hair Dryer is very convenient. Small and it has a pretty good power.  The item arrived in perfect conditions.
"awesome hair dryer,this is not a cheap one from your local variety store,well built works great worth every pennie and then some,GREAT BUY."
"I also first tried this product while on vacation.  This little hair dryer is compact, light, and powerful.  The best part, however, is the service I got from this vendor!  My order was filled right away, I got it within days, and the price was the best I found by far.  Thanks, Jen!    Anita  Stratford, CT"
"I've used this style of dryer for decades, and this is my favorite model ever! It gets the job done quickly and efficiently, and it is kinder to my hair. To top it off, it is the most reasonably priced dryer I've bought in many years. I bought an extra one, just in case!"
It works well and mounts easily the night light is mounted in the handle and give just the right amount of light
This is my second one. Had the first one for many years and now replacing it with new one. Was so glad they were still available as my family loves this blow dryer. It is so handy and ready to go when ever we need to use it! LOVE!!
"Really love it. Have been using it for two months and it works great. The price is awesome, $7.79 with free shipping using Prime. Light weight, quiet sound and fast speed to dry my hair. Can't find any problem with it. Highly recommend."
"This is a great hair dryer at a great price.  My wife already had this one and has been using it for several years.. So when my other brand hair dryer died, I bought this one and so far so good.  I have been using it for about 3 months now."
"I love the hot and cool settings. Does a great job overall, and I'm excited to try the diffuser it comes with"
"Purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery.  We used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall.  Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy."
"Couldn't be more impressed with a blow dryer! The color jumps right out at you; the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great. Heats up really fast & on high is probably too hot for some. Have medium short hair, so no need for attachments, but I'm sure they would function well if you need them. Can't say enough about the color lol!"
"Love this hair dryer. So glad i got it. Also, i live what the company stands for."
Love my new dryer. Much better that the ones I've had before. I like that you can adjust the temperature.
I liked it so much ... The size is small and very good materials .. I strongly advice any one who is looking for hair dryer to buy it Five stars ...
"This dryer is perfect for the intended purpose which is an efficient, small package at a very resonable price. The air flow and heat settings are good with well marked and designed switches. The folding handle and variable voltage make it ideal for travel as well.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again."
this blow dryer was in a hotel room i was staying at. i fell in love with it it dried my hair so fast it is very powerful i love it!!!!!!!!!!
"Compact, dry hair fast. Great buy for the price! It fits in any size suitcases or bags, used it in Europe with no problem."
Got this for a trip to Italy.  It packed easily and took up minimal space.  You still need the plug adapters for it but it worked great while on the trip.
I love this hair dryer it work really well. Heat is evenly distributed throughout the blower. easy to use. I never have issues using this dryer.
This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  A great buy!
Good power.  Easy to handle.  Settings don't get in the way of the handle.  This is the third one I've bought.
"I blow dry my hair every morning after my shower, works great,   light weight in my hand..."
It is a really good and strong blow dryer which last a long time.It is a really good brand very good for long hair
This dryer is not harsh on my hair....love all the heat/speed levels! Excellent buy! No more digging in my travel bags with its great new color!!
"This is a great portable hair dryer.  My hair is fine and can dry out from some dryers, but this one is really a good product.  I love the combination of ionic and ceramic technology, which I really need for my hair.  I can keep the frizzies out, and my hair dries quickly without drying out.  Blow drying is so much easier.  I am really picky about blow dryers and my hair, so I am not being frivolous here.  This dryer is a keeper! So convenient for travel!"
"drys your hair very quickly with a smooth shine,  so glad I bought it., will fit into a small corner of my luggage, so very handy."
"Love it, has 3 settings and cool, warm and hot for drying hair. Works very nice. And low, med and high also."
"I don't know what I'll think in six months if the dryer konks out on me.  But for now, I couldn't be happier.  I use the warm, low setting for my hair, and the results are great--smooth, non frizzy hair.  My hair is fairly straight, but some dryers manage to make it look a little frizzy, which is a mystery to me.  Anyway, I'm very pleased, and the price was excellent."
Great hair dryer. It is less noisy that my other hair dryer. Beautiful finish!!!
"Really nice find.  Saw this first at a prominent New York hotel and thought 'if it's good enough for them ...'  We've been very happy with it.  How long it'll last?  Who knows.  But so far, so very good."
I love this hair dryer.  I love the retractable cord.  The high speed is great!  I was surprised by how quiet it is.
super fast hair drying time without the frizz!  So much better than the dept store options for the same price or even more...very happy
Best blow dryer ever. I spend lots of money on my blow dryers.  One because I have a lot of thick curly hair and I like to straighten it. This works super fast and I am very pleased.
Very good hair styler. I like that you can buy tools for it if you need them. It has just the right amount of power to easily dry hair
VERY nice dryer. Larger sized travel. Nice power & doesn't frizz my hair like my old dryer did. Happier with a full-sized travel than the compact ones... dries hair faster & without the frizz!
"I had one for a year or two, but I dropped it.  So, I ordered the same one.  Pretty much perfect.  Note that the retractable cord didn't work on the first one I got, but they replaced it right away.  I LOVE the retractable cord and folding style, and the ionic drying really works fast.  Really good dryer."
I have had a hair dryer for years when it gave out. I have always used Con Air products and have been very happy with them. This hair dryer does NOT disappoint.  Great product has several sets to choose from and a cool button which is really neat feature I never had that before. It has high power but not overwhelming for you or your hair. Love this product and love Conair!
"My old Conair died so I read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer.  Very satisfied.  The weight is good, the attachments are fine, and the price was right!  You don't need anything better.  I really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings. A winner!"
"Fast shipping. Nice weight, high quality product. Great choices of speeds, heat and cooling levels. Dries hair quickly and effortlessly. Highly recommended."
Very Much Worth It!
"great product.  This is the second one I have bought, to give to my niece as a birthday gift since we love ours so much."
A great addition to my hair styling toolbox!  Dries my hair in about 7 minutes.  Love the different settings and the extra part for directing the air to go where you want it.
Powerful!
exactly what I needed. love it.
Excellent. Small. No negatives.
this is a great dryer for my curly frizzy long hair. makes it smoothe
"I'm so excited when I receive this item, and can't wait to try it. The product was shipped from Japan and took about 20 days to be delivered."
"So far, so good.  I have found that these hair dryers do not last, so, &#34;time will tell&#34;.<br />Works good, no complaints."
Sure does blow hot.
I love it. It was exactly what I wanted.
First used this hair dryer when staying at a motel & had to have it.  I love the retractable cord.
Turned out to be an awesome product and delivery. Use it everyday!
Of all of the dryers I've owned in my life- this is my favorite.  I've only been using it for 3 days and I'm in love!
Love this hair dryer and it provides excellent results very quiet while drying and I can finally watch tv thank you
"I have a small bathroom, so putting the hair dryer on the wall is a great solution. It is at my fingertips!"
I used this every day.  Our master bathroom is small which is why I wanted a wall mount.  Works perfectly and installed in minutes.
"My husband and I have used Andis hair dryer for years.  When ours stopped working, I was worried that I couldn't find them again, so I went on line with Amazan and was pleased to find the same brand.  we love these dryer and glad to find them again.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Ruth O'Dell"
"You see these at the better motels but dont find them at the big box stores , my wife wanted this in her bathroom at home. Ordered this one , got it fast , just what we wrer looking for great vender"
This hair dyer works great and I have seen it for more money at local stores. I highly recommend it!
"You can't get excited over a hair dryer. It works , it dries and thats all it has to do."
"Well, I haven't used the product yet, but it's small size is perfect for packing. I'll try to remember to leave additional feedback on its use."
Love this dryer.  First saw at hotel in San Diego.  I had to have it.  Amazon had it the cheapest on the internet. I would recommend this product.
"If you love vanilla, you will love this essential oil! I'm glad I bought this"
I bought this product almost 3 years ago.  It is so nice to be hands free and feel confident it will stick to the counter (or glass).  I recently bought it as a gift for my mom.  She loves it.
The dryer was exactly as advertised and I am extremely satisfied with the hair dryer  It was shipped without delay.
"I love this dryer! It is fast and relatively quiet. I have had great hair days ever since I bought this. Since my hair dryers only seem to last a year or so, I am buying a couple extras as backup. I think this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned."
"I bought this hair dryer several years ago and really loved it, so when it stopped working recently due to a loose connection in the GFCI plug I knew I had to purchase it again.  The retractable cord is just brilliant -- every hair dryer should have this feature.  The cool shot button is handy to help set your style.  And the diffuser attachment is just *fabulous*, with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution.  I am so glad Conair is still making this model and that Amazon carries it."
This blow dryer works great.  It never frizzes my hair and the temperature control settings are really nice! It is not too heavy and I can easily dry my long hair without getting a workout! I also really enjoy the color. Awesome product!
Works great. We actually used this in a hotel and loved it so much we wrote down exactly what it was and ordered one for home. Very happy...and the price is great!
"I wash and dry my hair everyday.  I used this hair dryer in a hotel and loved it!  I've been searching for a good hair dryer that didn't break the bank for years.  My husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker. It leaves my hair so soft.  My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  The retractable cord is great.  And, I love the folding handle for travel."
I love my new blow dryer. It does not dry out my hair. perfect. Thanks
This is a newer model of the one that we already had that finally stopped working. We loved the older model and are glad that we were able to replace it with this one. It is just what we wanted.
"Very pleased with the product and with Amazon's system. Found the dryer we wanted, paid a reasonable price , and received it quickly. Attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted."
"This Hair Dryer has a nice color, and has been working so good.<br />So far so good!!!<br />The turbo velocity is quick drying. Is comfortable to use and easy to handling."
I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go.  Great product.
"Excellent Hair Dryer--my wife, daughter and guests love them.  Very well made.  Seem to last forever.  I am installing two more so we have one in each bathroom.  The first one is about 10 years old and running strong."
"I bought this for my family and we all just love it!  The cord is a little on the shorter side, but the dryer itself works great and dries the hair very fast! Worth the $."
Bought this because I loved the hidden real away cord.  Works great and puts out LOTS of air.  Drys hair fast. Love it.
"A hotel we recently stayed in had this hair dryer and I loved it so much, had to buy one when I got home.<br />Dries hair quickly and is nice and light too."
My wife loves this hair dryer. It produces very warm air with tremendous air flow. I will say it took 2 months for it to finally come from the time I originally ordered it.
Great little travel dryer.  Super strong for the size!
This hair dryer is the best !!  I have very long hair and it dries my hair in minuets.  It used to take me 20 minuets to dry my hair.  Now with this great dryer it only takes me minuets.  This saved a lot of time in the morning.  I can dry my bangs in seconds. They come out perfect every time.
Loves it and it can blow cool air too. Very easy to use. Thanks again
"Love this hairdryer!  I'd buy it again - great value - it's heavy and seems like a more expensive hairdryer, works great!"
great! it is small and light but blow quickly.
Bought for a trip to Europe; worked great with an adapter; no troubles. Small and easy to fit into luggage!
I love this blow dryer. Its ionic which is the best type of blow dryer for your hair and it really does make hair smoother and softer. It very stylish looking and easy to hold. It works great every time I use it and only takes about 40 minutes to dry my hair. The heat flow is very strong and I also like the cool shot as well. It very chilly. lol
"This dryer is perfect for those with medium to short length cuts. If you have a 3 foot long mane of thick, beautiful hair or a maybe pile of the dredds, forget this one, that's not the intention. Wall mount is very convenient and appealing for guests. The price is good, it's easy to install and is quite functional."
"I've always been a fan of Conair dryers, but this is the best one that I have ever owned.  I really like the easy open lint catcher and the super strong air flow.  It takes no time at all to dry my hair and the frizziness is greatly reduced.  Highly recommended!"
"This product got fast in a new not opened package with instructions and everything, it is usefull and very light i love it!"
I received this as a gift and love it!  I have naturally curly hair and live in an area of high humidity.  This dryer dries my hair and leaves it smooth rather than fly away.
Very small and very light.  Perfect for travel and my silicon diffuser fits right over the nozzles.  I recommend this product.
Works well. Folds easily. Very handy for travel. Had another one for many years and it very stopped working. (Was stolen from our van during a cross country trip.)
Works as expected... great.  The individual heat / fan speed controls are a very nice feature.
"Got it. Exactly as advertised, Prompt Services. RECOMMENDED.<br />Perfect for everybody in the family. Just a handy gadget!!!<br /><br /> Thank you very much."
Love this hairdryer. I found it in a hotel in Houston and had to have one for my own. It blows at a great temperature--just hot enough but not so hot as to burn you--but is very fast due to the high velocity of air it outputs from the dryer. This is the fastest (and best) dryer I have owned.
The best wall mounted dryer I've found!  I also love the little night light as it's enough to light my way to the bathroom at night!
"This hairdryer is pretty, smooth, and makes my hair incredibly shiny, soft, smooth and frizz free. It dries my hair quicker than other hairdryers and is quieter too. Love it!"
"I was so tired of having my hair dryer stored in a drawer, with a cord that tangled up in everything.....then I found this little wonder and I'm a happy camper.  It is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms, but it looks nice, has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly, dries your hair perfectly.  It has two speeds which are great for styling, and a cord that is NEVER in your way.  I really love this hair dryer."
"My $160 blow dryer burned out on vacation.  I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  This one was cheaper, but I had never heard of the brand before so I was hesitant, but after researching and reading the reviews, I figured I would go for it.  All I can say is I love it!  It's quiet, it's light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy."
"I first tried this dryer at a time share. I was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that I bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home. Now it's always handy to grab, and it doubles as a night light. It just plugs in; no wiring involved. This is my second purchase; it was a birthday gift for a girlfriend. She is equally delighted by this dryer's speed."
A bit heavier than most and cost a little more but but it is a whole bunch better than the cheaper ones.  Definitely a good product
I love my wall mounted blow dryer! It puts out a great volume of air which I like and was looking for. It doesn't get too hot.... temp is just right. I like the small amber night light in the bathroom at night. I would purchase this item again in a heart beat !
"perfect size, power, and light in weight.. best of all great price.. I couldnt ask for more<br />I use it eveyday @1st I though the power was not enough.. But I was wrong this little<br />dryer packs a punch...! its so I bought another one to share with friend (as a gift) lol<br />and the price.. you cant even find 1 this low"
Im a hairstylist. I have 2 of these. Super light and dries great. Not loud either!
Replaced my old (20 years old) Oster with new one.  It works just as good.  I have no<br />regrets.  Great product
"I love this hair dryer!  It is quiet, there are 3 temperature settings, hot/warm/cold, and 2 speed settings.  I love the retracting cable, which allows for easy uncluttered storage.  I did have to get used to holding it securely while I pressed the button on the side to retract the cable, though, dropping it the first time, because I didn't have a good hold on it.  I had really long hair when I first got it, and then I cut my hair super short recently, so I have yet to figure out how the diffuser works.  I can't wait to try it for some wavier locks once my hair grows out.  This is definitely a good price for a great product!"
"Magic. Pure magic. Attachments are hard to get off, but I don't want them falling on my feet when I'm drying my hair either. Heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome. Cute color and feels great in my hand. Dries my thick mane super quickly!"
"This dryer is perfect for a first timer's dryer, it does not make your hair frizzy and the temperature i just right. It works well and the cord has just about the right length. Its light and easy to use in small hands and the additional fixtures are great for styling. You don't want a dryer that drys your hair completely some moisture must remain or it will be frizzy."
"Cheap and comfortable, defenetly worth it"
"This hairdryer exceeded my expectations.  Although it's a bit on the heavy side, its compact frame and powerful air flow fully compensate that one drawback.  One of the best hairdryers I have owned."
"Does what its suppose to do, like the ability to clean it."
"Easy installation, and the wife loves it, so in my book that's worth 5 stars."
Easy to use. Easy to store. Dries quickly. Nice design and fits in with my bathroom dcor. I would definitely buy product again if needed or for a gift.
The style looks sheik hanging on wall. Looks good and very quiet. I like the nite light that's built into it.
"This is not a compact travel hair dryer, but for home use it's sleek, lightweight, and powerful. It has all the features anyone would need, and it's easy to handle."
Love this hair dryer. The different speeds are great and drys fast Got it fast in the mail love that.
I would order with them again for sure. Package arrived in a timely fashion. Love the product. Professional correspondence with them.
These pony tail holders are a good strong weight to hold my heavy hair without breaking hair. The item arrived in 3 days from across the country. It is just a described; good quality. This store is so great because they don't charge shipping fee. Other web sites charged a fee equal to or even more than the cost of the product! I recommend this store and the product.
Only had my dryer for a month but so far it's the best one I've ever had.  Ionic  feature makes hair smooth.  Seems to be built sturdy.  Folding handle retractable cord work well.  It it holds up it's a super buy at the price .
"I wanted a salon quality dryer and got it!  This dryer is fast, easy to work with, not too heavy and does a fantastic job.  Best I've ever owned."
Good Product. Like hot and normal button features.
"Fast shipping, easy to assemble (even though the &#34;directions&#34; are just pictures) and works great! I have very short 3b hair and I only needed to use the dryer for 10 minutes to completely dry my hair and it looked great!"
I really needed a good blow dryer to dry & straighten my hair and this one made my hair look really healthy. I love it.
Dries my thick hair very quickly. It makes quick work of straightening my hair while blow drying. Leaves my hair shiny. It's an awesome dryer.
"It was more than I expected, package was deluxe and product quality is super.  I am in love with my hair dryer."
Have used this sunscreen for several years and know that it is a superb product.  I especially like the fact that it is fragrance free and can be used under makeup easily.
Bonnet size is perfect. 20 minutes is enough to get my hair dry. It's not noisy. It work very well and never turn off.  Bought it was a good decision. I use it while I watch TV or read.
"I love this dryer! I'll never buy a less expensive one from a discount store again. This one is quieter and even though it doesn't blast you with hot air (like the less-quality ones), it works really well. My best friend bought it first, and her hair is un-managable most days. She loves it, so I bought it too, and I love it. A great deal too!"
I like this hair dryer and can't believe the price for such a great quality dryer.  Highly recommend.  Way better than anything at Walmart or Target.
This is my absolute favorite hair dryer ever. It dries my hair very fast since it's ceramic. I love the styling options and my hair gets a lot of volume.
This is the best hair dryer I have ever bought.  It has cut my drying time in half and it is so much quieter than any other dryer I have ever used.  It was worth every penny!!!!!
"Not disappointed. Works well and super small, perfect for travel."
"Bought this for limited use to seal windows, having never purchased one before. It worked great."
"Bought this item and didnt use it for another two or three weeks after purchase, but when i did!!! OMG I totally love it! Nice price and its a nice soft pink, looks great and feels great, that I want to wash and dry my hair everyday!! Its quiet, easy to handle and work with! Totally love it!!"
bought this to replace the exact same model for my wife that was 10 years old... it's a good product... works really good and easy to store...
Love the small size.  Dries my hair very quickly and comes with a great travel bag.  It does such a good job that I forget that it is travel size.
This little blow dryer is amazing! It's very light weight but powerful. I was needing a blow dryer that wasn't so heavy and this dryer is the one for the job. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a lightweight dryer that does a great job as well!
"Over all great product! It's stylish, light weight, easy to use and hold. Very strong and powerful air power for being such a small blow dryer. You have all the functions like hot and cool, high and low. The black handle has glitter in it and it sparkles in the light lol. All in all this is a great blow dryer and even better price!"
"Great product, fast delivery and reasonable price! Highly recommended!"
Love it. Does a good. Hot enough. Diffuser is a bonus.
"I am very happy with this product. It dries fast! It seems like a very sturdy product, not like some of the low end products out there. This is salon quality!!"
my favorite hairdryer.  I have been using this for years! Professional dryer
This blow dryer is very efficient. The retractable cords are convenient and I have no malfunctioning problems at all. The colour is bright and pretty. I think I got my money's worth.
WORKS WELL AND THE COLOR IS BETTER THEN SHOWN MORE LIKE NEON GREEN!  DEFINITELY A GOOD PURCHASE - GAVE AS A GIFT
This a wonderful little dryer at a remarkably low price. It is quiet and efficient. This is a very  good BUY!!!! Recommended.
I like the hair dryer very much.  My old one was really loud.  This is not at all.  Nice color.  Very pleased I bought it.
"I ordered this because it was cheaper than Sallies sold it for. I actually have this product and it has been the best hair dryer I've ever owned, so I ordered a new one for my mom as a gift. It came in the exact packaging and I couldn't be happier. Now my mom can stop stealing my hair dryer!"
"Love these dryers! Had one for 9 years, finally burned out. Just bought 2 more. So convenient to have it right there on the wall, and the night light is a bonus."
"This item works well, seems sturdy, is attractive, and was priced right.  Hopefully, it will last!"
"This hair dryer is everything that I could have expected. The diffuser is perfect for my curly hair. It dries quickly and efficiently. Plus, I love the controls. I'm 61, and my hair has become quite thin. This dryer really volumizes and gives my hair the perfect curl. A MUST buy."
Very powerful. Dries my hair quickly.
This hair dryer is very powerful and dries quickly.
"good product, relatively light weight and dry faster. I love the metallic look purple. I found it's better to use warm temp i/o hot temp, my hair become less fuzz and more shine and smooth."
"We had one of these for years, replaced it with a different design, but returned to this one because it's just a superior design.<br /><br />Easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount. Excellent performance in drying hair.<br /><br />I should have ordered two just in case they stop making this design type... hard to find."
"I usually cut corners with this stuff. This is still a cheap dryer, but it's very good quality. The matte look is nice, has three settings for heat and three settings for how much air is pushed. Plus the cool button! It's worked great for half a year now. If it broke I'd buy another one!"
The main feature of this dryer that I find most appealing is the power.  The air flow is strong and steady which expediates the hair drying process when minutes matter.  I also enjoy the retractable cord and folding capability -- an asset for storage and travel.
I love this dryer. The cord system is super convenient.Easy to use for a reasonable price. Get it! you wont regret it.
"This is the second Sunbeam/Oster &#34;wall&#34; mount hair dryer we have had over<br />perhaps the past twenty years, and we have never been more satisfied.  It<br />looks good on our bathroom wall, and it is not intrusive in any way.  It is also<br />quiet and easy to keep clean.  I recommend it highly.  Also, thanks to Amazon,<br />it is the worlds best shopping source."
"Yes, I love it.  It is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast."
"This hairdryer has all the features I want: retractable cord, powerful, folds up, cool botton and attractive.  I bought mine over 5 years ago and used it every other day, and the cord and casing all are in excellent condition still, but the motor just died.  I think over 5 years is a reasonable time, so I'm bying the same one again."
"THE BOMB!!!!!!!!! I have thick hair and at 41 yrs old been looking, for years, for a blow dryer that BLOWS ALOT OF AIR. BINGO, Found it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!!!"
"My wife is very happy with this hair dryer and she has very full, THICK hair!"
I had this one for over 3 years and it worked great.  It just recently died and I bought the exact same model.  The retractable cord is so nice!
This hair dryer very handily keeps the dryer out of the way and the is very conveniently located on the wall near my vanity.
"Love this dryer, works so great and fast too. Bought it for my mom as a gift and she absolutely loves it! She has very thick hair and hair dryer worked great for her."
"I don't use my hair dryer for much more than drying purposes... Lol... It's simple, in-expensive, and it blows a lot of hot air... ;)<br /><br />It serves its purpose well..."
"It's been almost a year since I purchased this hair dryer and I love it.  I love the retractable cord and the different heat settings, as opposed to just having low and high options.  Works great!"
This is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it!  We already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one.
"This little hair dryer is great! I had one just like it in the past. It lasted 20 years. It fits perfectly in my suit case, has just the right amount of power and heat. It is much better than others I have used (they did not last long). It is well constructed too. A good purchase. I had looked every where for a replacement and had to settle for inferior products. I am really happy Amazon had it. I highly recommend."
"So my previous 1875 watt ionic dryer started making my hair frizzy and finally died on me. I was looking around for a new one and found that my favorite brand in hair products made a cute stylish hair dryer. It doesn't just look nice, it works amazing too. I love how it has a setting for hot and warm. I haven't had a hair dryer with that option yet. I also really like the switch, rather than a sliding one. I have no complaints and I highly recommend it. It dries quickly and I have no frizzies and my hair looks so much better with this dryer compared to my old Revlon. It's great for drying my curlies and works just as well for blowouts, too."
I recommend this hair dryer because it works well and is easy to install in your bathroom.  The price is right too.
"This hair dryer is the best we have found yet. It puts out a concentrated stream of air that is not too hot but drys your hair quickly. It has an easy to use mount for the dryer. Only negative is the instructions for mounting on the wall, which are backward, but once mounted it is a joy."
Peroxyl isn't available where I live. The shipment was slower than I expected but arrived at the end of the promised time frame. The product is excellent for gum problems and was recommended by my dentist. It shouldn't be used without a dentist's approval.
This is a very nice compact (foldable) hand held dryer.  There are two heat settings and the power is just perfect for my application which is simply to have an on hand portable dryer to dry clothes when I travel.  I occasionally need to hand wash a few clothing items in hotels when out on the road and this is perfect for this mission.
This is one of the best hair dryers I have ever used.  It is very quiet and light.  Since it's an Ionic it leave your hair smooth and shiny.  It's a full size hairdryer but travels very well since it's so lightweight.  I would highly recommened it..
I am very happy with the dryer so far. It fits in the limited space I have in my salon. I love the way the controls work and I was very surprised how much heat it generates. I am very pleased that it works on a 110 plug as opposed to a 220. I do feel that this is one thing you need to add in the description of this item. I almost did not purchase it because I did not know this piece of information.
"I bought two of this because my sisters, enrolled in a beauty salon school, and they tell me it is truly amazing, just keep in mind that this is a professional dryer, and if used without caution, it may burn some ones hair, because it is that powerful!"
Love this dryer. It's light and dries my<br />Hair super fast.
"Good quality, drys quickly without frying your hair.  Not as noisy as some dryers.  Light weight, sturdy.  It seems like it will last.  I would recommend it."
Definitely more convenient thatn going to a salon all the time. I love doing my own hair at home now and this has allowed me to spend less time blow drying and styling it.
This Pro Bonnet Style Dryer shipped fast from the seller and was easy to assemble.  It is whisper quiet and does a great job drying hair evenly.  I recommend this product.
This small and powerful dryer is perfect for my bathroom...up and out of the way! Easy to mount! Highly recommend!
I have always felt that Conair makes the best dryers.  It is quiet and drys your hair quickly.  Nice black color.  Lightweight.
"Excelent product and quick delivery!! If you want a professional hair dryer, this is used by stylists here. Thank  you from Dominican Republic! Excelente producto y entrega r&aacute;pida! Si desea un secador de pelo profesional, este es el que utilizan las estilistas aqu&iacute;. Gracias desde Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana!"
"I don't have much insight for the hair dryer's performance as it was a Xmas gift for my wife but her feedback-in-a-nutshell to me was &#34;I Love It!!&#34;.  After exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point, I settled on the Onei MK-II based purely on the Amazon reviews and it apparently paid off.  (BTW, she has very fine, blonde hair)."
Great dryer with good fan speeds.  Quieter than most without hurting your ears with high pitched noise.  The cool down button lets you customize your heat. Folds up for easy packing. We own 4 of these as they will probably quit making them for something of less quality soon.
"LOVE this hair dryer! It is excellent for drying curly hair, which needs intense heat in one area. Light weight and not overly bulky, this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile. Curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache, due to the long use. I recommend for anyone who wants a great, affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat!"
"I had this dryer for years and they don't sell it in the stores around me any more so I was so happy when I found it on Amazon!  Love this dryer it does such a nice job with my curls! I ordered an extra one for the future, my daughters dryer died so she took my extra to use until she could replace hers. Well she loves it so much she just ordered two more one for me and a backup for herself!"
"I have been looking for a great blow dryer and actually the salon I go to the uses this dryer.  My hairdresser told me that it's a very good blow dryer and it does not damage your hair like the other dryers.  This turbo 3200 dryer dries my hair very quickly and I am happy with the end result.<br /><br />I recommend this dryer to anyone who is looking for a really good dryer.  It's a little expensive, but who cares if it's going to give great results then it's worth the money."
"Perfect !<br />Temperature adjustments, blow dry option are completely satisfactory.<br />Color looked different in picture but,  in real it looks very good."
Fit right where the old dyers was mounted. Great replacement for a reasonable cost.
"I love this hairdryer. At home, I use a CHI that I have had for about ten years. It still works perfectly but it is a beast. I was tired of using crummy hotel dryers and even the hand dryers at the gym so I started looking for a compact model and this really fits the bill at a great price. Keeps my hair as smooth as my pricey CHI and has a retractable cord plus a folding handle."
I bought this hair dryer for a rental condo in a chic downtown community and it fits RIGHT in !
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! this is the best hair dryer I've ever seen. It's really light, very quiet, and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle, which is unexpectedly brilliant. It also folds so it doesn't take too much space in my luggage when I travel. The chord is a bit too short, but with an extension is fine."
"This hair dryer is amazing!  My hair is very wavy & @ time very curly,<br />This dryer let's me style my hair easily.  It makes my dryer time so much faster.<br /><br />Love it!!<br /><br />Maggie, River Vale, NJ"
"This is by far the best blowdryer I have ever used. I've been using Conair's Yellowbird for 33 years, since I was 13. After using the Blackbird, I am equally impressed (if not more). My 25 year old daughter is now a big fan as well. I highly recommend these blowdryers...as I said, by far the best!"
This dryer is powerful but light weight and easy to handle.  The diffuser is large and the settings make styling easy.
This replaced my old wall hairdryer. I Love the design and the night light is very nice to have. Very quiet when running and I have the option of changing from 1200W to 1600W. I would recommend this hairdryer.
Great little dryer. It completes the drying process quickly and doesn't make a lot of noise.  It is light weight and easy to handle.
Has lots of power to dry hair quickly and it is great for travel.
"Love this hair dryer, light weight lots of power!! Great value for the money.  I have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power."
"the best hair dryer I've ever used!!!! I will highly recommend it to any one! I know this is expensive, but this is absolutely worth the money!!! You have to use it to believe what i said! my hair looks soo good now, my friends notice that and ask me what did i do differently. every body need to have one!!"
"I love how light weight this hair dryer is, and how quick it gets my hair dry!  I have curly hair and it does not make it frizz.  Love it!"
"This is a great product.  I didn't really believe all the Ionic hype, but it really does seem to make a difference.  My hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time (I'd say 30-40% faster).  It is a very hot hair dryer, so be sure to keep it away from your scalp and face.  But, I love it!"
"Nice size for storage. Dryer came ready to use, and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry. It would be nice to have a hanger loop."
"This is the best hair dryer. I usually go for cheap or easy to travel with hair dryers, but decided to try a fair priced ionic hair dryer to protect my hair. I'm so glad I did!! This dryer dries my long hair in about 5-7 minutes and leaves it straight and smooth. I hardly have to use my flat irons; which saves my hair even more from heat damage. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Sometimes the smallest things make the biggest difference!"
"I have had 4 of these and love them. This last one started burning up in my hand!!! I got my new one in three days, in time for another shampoo. I love Amazon!!"
"got this for over a month now. It is working great. I usually do not dry my hair, but living in NE there are a lot of snow days in the winter. I need to dry my hair before I head out. I am very satisfied with this hair dryer."
Super powerful and versatile!
Fits on the very skinny nozzle of my Deva Curl Dryer. Does a great job. The part of the diffuser that attaches to the dryer gradually gets wider so it will fit a variety of dryer nozzle widths. I don't think it will fit on very large (wide width) dryer nozzles though. I love it.
This hair dryer has a lower noise level when in use.  Many dryers have a very high pitch whine from the fan motor.  Fan was found as the dryer provided in a Hampton Inn.
"I love my light weight hair blower !  It is quick and easy and my hair comes out so soft and not frizzy.<br />It has two heat settings. I start out with the high one for a couple of minutes and then switch to the low<br />and it still dries nicely but does not stress my hair. I have very fine hair and lots of it so it is not easy to<br />dry. Oh, and my hair is long. This dryer is keeping my hair so nice people ask me how I make my hair<br />look like it belongs on a 30 year old. I'm 65. This wonderful blower has a lot to do with it !"
i got this a while back and its still working just like new. i love it. i wish the cord was longer but its pretty great and still living strong.
Amazing blow dryer! Worth every penny! I have naturally curly hair and this blow dryer gets it almost totally straight! Amazing power and heat! Product just like expected and shipping was fast for the free option. Got it in about a week!
"i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very, very impressed with this dryer.  rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair (especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair).  it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair.  i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i've bought.  the one &#34;con&#34; i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off. i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair."
Would absolutely buy it again! The highest speed is great! Even though I have short hair I'm sure anyone with long hair would find this dryer quick!
"My daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it. So, though my hair is much shorter than hers, I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Onei MK_ll, a different brand than my daughters.  I loved it the first time  I used it.  I color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and shine.<br />My daughter tried it when she came to visit and, of course, loved it!! So--I bought her one, too.  She claims that it is light, easy to handle, dries her hair quicker and over all, does a much better job than her old one.<br />The delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.  No problems."
"I bought 5 of these (with nightlight) to put in each bathroom of my home.  I find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord.  The dryer is powerful, not extremely noisy, and appears to be of good quality contruction."
"I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about this product.  My reasons for a 5-star rating:<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Powerful and efficient - hair dries quickly without being blown wild<br />* Able to easily style while drying<br />* Comes with two attachments AND they stay in place wonderfully<br />* Retractable cord eliminates hassles between uses<br />* For a hair drying styler, this is not excessively loud<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* No complaints!<br /><br />This has been my top choice in hair dryers after using my sister's awhile ago!  I finally confirmed the type to purchase.  Then, I found it on Amazon's &#34;Today's Deals&#34; (daily deals) - even better!  This is a fabulous hair drying styler at an extremely reasonable price (as listed or with a deal)!  Over my lifetime, I have used many hair dryers, with a wide price range, and had not ever been super pleased with any one in particular....before using this one.  I was so looking forward to getting it and was super excited to use it....I was not disappointed at all!"
This has to be the best hair dryer I have ever used. My hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after I blow dry it. But with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking rather then looking like I stuck my finger in a electric socket. It dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked. Love this hair dryer and Would recommend it to anyone.
"Great high quality hair dryer that works extremely well. Comes with a diffuser and all so it is great for even long, thick curly hair. Dries it quickly and overall it even looks like a very nice product as the handle material is very smooth with a good grip. Great value for purchase, would highly recommend."
"It works great, is a little bit heavy but has good power, it heated very well. I am happy with my purchase"
"I do not speak English, but I'll try, very good product, works well, has the necessary heat levels, I have not submitted any flaw, I recommend, is light, not heavy, my experience has been good with this product."
"I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. If you have straight, no-volume hair, this hair dryer is PERFECT. It gives me the only volume my hair will ever see. I have two houses and have one of these in each. My first one lasted me 4 years before I took it to Europe and all of the added voltage was too much. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
Very nice hair dryer. I first got to try this in a hotel in New York. I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair. I knew I had to get one when I got home! It dries your hair nicely without cooking your head! My old dryer got so hot it was uncomfortable. Not this one. I'm very happy with my purchase. Great price too!
My wife love this. Its very compact with a folding handle. It has an option for warm or normal air. Much more is that it's AUTO-VOLT so you can use it anywhere. A true travel dryer/styler. Highly recommended.
"This toap coat saves my life! Every time I feel disappointed by a nail polish, i put one coat of Orly glosser and it's like a new polish. It gives a very clean and bright finish to all kind of shades and textures. It makes the nail very shiny and smooth.<br />I protects from the wear and tear as well, but I think there is better out there if this is the only reason you're wanting a top coat. However if you want a top coat that brings the best of your polish, this is it!"
"I guess I've always been using sub-par hair dryers, this one blows them out of the water (pun very much intended)<br /><br />Thank you to everyone else who posted a great review, this is a great one to buy and I'm glad I came here to read reviews before I purchased.  It's pretty, very powerful, and my only gripe is the buttons are reversed from my last dryer so I'm constantly making it hotter instead of turning it off :)<br /><br />10/10"
I got this hair dryer to replace a dryer I had for several years.  This one is really good.  It provides a good flow of air and has 3 different heat settings and speed settings. I would recommend it.
excelent fast.  love it
Low noise good hair dryer
"Picked this out after using it in a hotel. I've had it in 3 or 4 hotels since then. It has a Medium speed which is rare, and the Cool setting, which I love. And it was reasonably priced!"
This is a good hair dryer.  It's the 4th one that I've bought over several years.
She loves it. It performs better than expected. Congrats on selling a GREAT product and thanks for asking.
"I couldn't find good for my hair any. Only this one I use about 2-3 years already, and still have it as a gift for my mom.<br />Highly recommended item!"
"Good, basic dryer. Liking it a lot."
Love this... It has made blow drying so much easier for me.
"Works great, cord retracts as expected."
"Lasts for years. This is my second one and when this one dies, I'll replace it with the same one. Cord keeper is awesome- I'll never go back. Excellent quality blow dryer- hot and dries fast."
Graduation gift for my niece.  She loved it.  Especially the fact that the cord disappears into it.....
Very convenient. Love it. Hve it in every bathroom
glad I purchased 2 one for each bathroom they're great no more looking through drawers to find the hair dryer
"good in quality, easy to use, quick dry"
Simple and functional. Great price. Works well so far....:)
Bought this a a gift for my wife. She loves it and loved how it shortens the drying time. Wen My mother comes for a visit from out of town she loves it as well and would get it if she hadn't just recently bought a lower model.
Good quality hair dryer with enough power to even satisfy my wife.  You can feel the quality while using.
Great for my small hands. Love it
Got it fast and have enjoyed it
This is my Conair dryer.  All of them lasted very well.  I just love that it hangs up out of the way in the bathroom.  Hope they never quit making them.
"Good hair dryer, especially for the price!"
"If I knew this Hair Dryer was this good. (more than just good), I wouldn't spend to buy many Hair Dryers in the past. This one is very quiet and powerful. The dryer is still cool after use it. Buy one. You won't regret."
"The lady who received it, loved it. She had selected it from all the similar products advertized. It continues to serve her well."
"This is a powerful blower. It shortens the drying time, and it is not that noisy, well if I compare it to the one I had for 4 years. Great quality. I am please my Dominican hair stylist recommended to me. I definitely recommend it to you. It is worth the price."
Really got what I waz expecting ! Great price and straight from Japan.I'm gonna buy more as a present for my sister!
"This is a must! I have thin naturally curly hair and I didn't want to damage my hair with a blow dryer that was gonna be too rough on me, I gave this one a try and OMG the diffuser and heat settings are perfect. I still have to use it for straightening, I'm sure its gonna be perfect though"
"Makes my hair nice and soft, glad I ordered it and would recommend it to anyone who has curly unruly hair. thanks Kathy"
"it's a pleasure hold this dryer in your hands, powerful yet elegant. I have had many of different dryers, this one is worth more than the price."
This was my favorite blow dryer. I had it for a few years and then it died on me. I couldn't find it in the stores anymore so I turned to Amazon. Yay! Got my fav dryer back and it works perfectly :)
I had an Andis Hair Dryer for at least 8 years until it died on me recently.<br />The replacement is wonderful; product still as reliable as it was before!
I love the wall mount hair dryers.  You always know where it is and it is never in the way. Click and it is ready to use and click it is put away.
This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  I would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again.
"I use this blow dryer daily, it works for me, that way I won't have to borrow my daughters on. a good price as well."
This is a truly fast dryer. It met or exceed my expectations. I have had it for about 6 months and love it.
I love this hair dryer.  It fits well in my hand.  Drys my hair beautifully and quickly.  I have fine hair and this dryer is not &#34;too much&#34;.  It has several speeds and heat options.  Would definitely recommend.
Was exactly what I was needing. Girlfriend has now purchased 3 of these. The turbo option is great and we will continue to get the same model
I love it.  It's very compact and lives up to all of the product descriptions.  I would buy it again.
"Such a great tool! It makes hair drying much faster, and my hair never stays curly. It drys almost all straight."
I love this hair dryer.  I bought the travel size and a local Ulta.  I immediately loved it.  Drys my hair fast and doesn't fry it. Would recommend it.
I love the Infinity Conair hairdryer.  I especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn't get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me.  The Cord Reel works great.
"Personally love the product compares to the old dryer that I have. Also,good for the price - great for short hair. curl too"
The last blow dryer we bought cost almost $100.00  when it broke I headed my wife off and purchased this one from amazon and my wife said it was as good as the $100.00 one we had.
I LOVE THIS DRYER!!! Salon worthy rollersets every time!  Gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly. Quite enough that you can hear the tv and have a conversation on the phone. Fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers okay. Its a tight fit BUT it DOES fit.
"I used to have a Babyliss (Conair's high-end line) and it started giving me problems roughly 4 weeks into having it. After a while I got fed up with the Babyliss and decided to purchase this well-rated hair dryer.<br />I like that there are three temperature settings, good air flow, and two attachments for channeled or diffused air. I have curly hair, so I use both attachments and are happy with their performance. Another great thing about this product is that I can feel safe that the intake side won't suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss. The mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration. The intake is also very easy to ope/close, which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime. Whenever I clean the intake, I feel like my hair dryer is new since the air flow is so good after cleaning.<br />I have had this hair dryer for over a year and would repurchase it for the price and functionality."
"Love it, very convenient. I was thrilled when I got a hotel room and they had this hair dryer in the bathroom. I was very excited when I saw it available on Amazon. I really didn't think it would work as well as the ones in the hotel as I figured there's was a commercial grade. I was pleasantly surprised it worked just as well. I get a lot of compliments on it when I have guests, especially those that forgot to pack one or don't want to go digging for their. It is an excellent idea for bathrooms or teenagers room. My Granddaughter has asked for one to put beside her vanity. Perhaps Santa will provide."
"Nice quality, you get what you pay for. It's efficient and the temperature options as nice. I use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely. Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won't fall off all the time like it might with another brand. Make sure you don't click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature -- I almost thought I had a defective product because I didn't know I had clicked it by accident. Otherwise it's working great so far."
"a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable.  I used this model at the Four Seasons Santa Barbara, and was able to locate it on Amazon.  I ordered one for each of my bathrooms!"
"This dryer is very nice, and my wife is completely satisfied.  On the other hand, I liked the older one better because it was more forceful and the cord was longer.  We didn't have to dim the light on the old one, but this one is very bright and I had to tape something over it to tone it down.  I used a piece of thick paper that I cut to exactly cover the light and it is OK now.<br />It's a very nice product and I think that we would order it again."
"I purchased this hair dryer for it's Ionic qualities.  I live in an extremely dry and often windy climate, and my hair tends to get fly-away very quickly.  After using this hair dryer only once, I noticed a great improvement in that my hair was no longer as fly away as before.  The dryer has great features, and does the job extremely well."
"This is a good basic dryer.  I don't use the attachments but find that it works quickly and is easy to hold.  I don't think that it being tourmaline ceramic adds much to the product's quality, but it's still a fine product."
This is a great little dryer.  I have fine hair and it's nice that on low it has a nice gentle blow speed and temperature.
"I am in hotel industry - I could buy thousands of these. Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand. I've never seen a guest use their own brought hair-dryer. they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it's obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it. Never falls off, always there when you need your hair fluffy."
"I absolutely love this dryer! I was a bit apprehensive at first because of the price tag but it's well worth the money. I have curly, color treated hair and I definitely noticed the difference using this hair dryer verses my old one. My hair feels healthy, smoother...as if I just came back from the salon! Great product!"
"Great! Its light, efficient and has a super cute design. Its even easier to use than my mom's expensive hair dryer."
Wife likes very much. Been in use 3 months still going strong.
"I didn't realize how great this hair dryer was until I went on vacation without it. My hair was so dry and icky, I couldn't wait to get home to use it. I will never leave home without it. Worth the money, great product, works like it says!"
"Great product.<br />Powerful and dry hear fast. A bit heavy though but once you get used to it, it is doing its job perfectly"
This hair dryer is amazing! It's light weight makes it easier to use. It dryers your hair super fast! I would definitely recommend it.
"After years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity, I now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall.  Be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short.  Love this for organization, and it works very well."
I love this.  Very quick and easy to mount on the wall.  Very convenient and no mess on the counter!  Always available when you want it.
Absolutely the best hair dryer I've ever owned hands down!!!! I love this dryer so freakin fast it's amazing. Came in less than a weeks time. Very pleased!
Great hair dryer....super quiet..and dries hair quickly.... it is very light compared to my other hairdryers and the cord winder works very well
I really like this blow dryer. It has a very strong motor and gets the job done quickly. The price was just right.
"Its brand new, just as expected. Works perfectly! It fits all of the descriptions of when I purchased this product!"
"I used the blow dryer for the first time tonight and I love love love it! For one it is pretty and it has different temperatures you can choose from, and different air speeds. My hair is really frizzy, and the blow dryer helped to de-frizz my hair. Love it!!"
"Very powerful dryer, worth every penny."
"One of the best reasonably priced dryers out there. My old one made my hair frizzy and dried out, I am so pleased with my results!"
I love this hair dryer.  It is so easy to use.  And I really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room.  Does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging.  Great for all seniors!!
"I was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that I had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews.  The reviews are CORRECT.  The air that comes out of this dryer is incredible -- it dries my hair quickly, but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat-- it is hot, but not scorching.  A great purchase!"
This works great. We've had it a few years now and still going strong.
Works great and half the cost of the store. Plus free Shipping.
"Works great. Compact, portable, powerful. So far so good. Would purchase again. Purchased to replace an older model of same brand."
"This dryer cuts my drying and styling time in half, it works very well and I am very happy to have bought it."
"Bought this hair dryer over a year ago and my husband and I have used it<br />everyday since with no problems.  It is easy to fold when we travel and<br />love the fact that the cord retracts.  I decided to go ahead and order a<br />second one to have on hand when this one goes out because with my luck<br />it wouldn't be available then, and I really like it."
"My daughters aren't strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand. This is cute, lightweight, feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair. Wonderful!"
I came across this hair dryer at a Hyatt hotel and I was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair (I have lots of thick hair) leaving it looking shinny.
"I purchased this hair dryer for my wife who happens to be a professional hair stylist, and I would say that she is very selective (picky) about the products she uses. For her work, similar hair dryers sell for almost $200. Consequently, I thought this was a very good buy. At any rate, so far she loves this product. She uses it at home and has nothing but compliments about the dryer. She even suggested that we should buy one for each of our two daughters for Christmas. So far, a very happy customer!"
"I am very happy with this dryer; it is light, strong, and the retractable cord works much better than the last one I had. It is also not overly bulky. I highly recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price."
"Having recently broken my wrist and also having hand function issues, this is the perfect dryer for me. I also loved the price and it is supposed to be a high quality dryer that should last for years. So what else could you want? I have never used more than high and never use those cool shots or ionic type dryers. This fits my needs perfectly. Love it!"
Fast shipping has lots of power my friend recommended this blower she loves it so I am very excited to use mine
I have owned a makeup mirror for many years and this one is better than the other two I have owned.  This is one is more stable no matter what position you have it sitting in.
powerful and very lovely to use! highly recommend! I just used it for the first time today and it dried my hair very quickly! :)
"i have fine thin hair and dont need much in the way of a dryer,this one is perfect, love the attachments, dont even need a straightner when  I use this."
LIGHT WEIGHT AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HEAT
fit right where we needed it in our motorhome
Great product.  Cuts dry time in half when compared to other dryers.  Purchased my own and when my daughter borrowed it she loved it so I ordered another for her as a gift.  Great product at a reasonable price.
"Absolute bargain of the century! My wife had two Chi's break in the course of around five years. While most would argue that 2-3 years is adequate - when one pays $100+ for a hairdryer, you expect to see many long years of service. Instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced Chinese made hair dryer, we took a gamble on the Herstyler Pro. The result? My wife is 101% pleased - really. FIt and finish is as good as the Chi. Logical button placement and function is perfect. Temps are ideal, force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional. They could double the price and it would still be a steal. VERY well done. I like it so much, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost."
"This is the second unit I've puchased like this, was very pleased with the first one. Very handy, no worries about plugging it in since it's hard wired to begin with. The first unit is about five yrs old now with perfect performance...    Tops St. Louis"
This is our third Oster Wall Hair Dryer.  We've used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home.      We love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient.  We don't have to reach under the bathroom sink to pull it out every morning or find a place to plug it in without bumping into anything else on the counter.  It takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install.
"I had a really old Conair that I liked but it was quite shabby, so replaced it with what I knew should be a good hairdryer. The different heat levels are great with the cool down to set the curl"
"This gets a 5+ star in my book.  I've used for a few weeks now and it dries my hair faster, smoother, and the 2 directional heads are perfect for directing the heat exactly where you want it to go.  It is so much better than my Conair that I had.  This is high end quality."
This is my second purchase of this dryer the first one lasted for about 10 years.  The newer model is great I would highly recommend it as I have to many friends.
I love this hair dryer!  It is very quiet compared to many dryers I have had.  It is awesome having so many heat and speed settings.  It comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn't really need them. The retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer.  I would definitely buy again. The only con I can find is that it is a little heavier them I am use it.
Wonderful product!  Purchased due to shoulder injury and now post surgery.  I can blow dry hair while device securely holds blow dryer and can safely move it in any direction.
Works well and I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when using it.  Shipped quickly.  Stores well and electrical cord recoil is cool.
This blow dryer is pretty impressive! I've had it for a few months now and am still happy with it. It dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth. It is actually better than my old $120 blow dryer! Definitely recommend!
"We bought two wall mount hairdryers to install at a vacation rental.  They work well and are attractive.  They are small, don't take up too much wall space and leaves the counter top clear.  It was a good choice for us."
"High powered and compact, it is the perfect little travel blow dryer.  I also love the little attachable defuser and straightener.  Way too cute and works amazingly well."
"I've owned many hairdryers over the years...they seem to last a year or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death.  None has been anything to get excited about.  I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it's not a decorative accessory. The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  Even more impressive is the way it styles may hair.  I have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time.  I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.  It still provides plenty of heat to set the curve, but the air velocity doesn't blow my hair off the brush.  My hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume.  Fantastic!"
I love the number of options this dryer gives you as far as heat and intensity. The attachment is smooth and the dryer is quiet. Good purchase.
"What can you say about a hairdryer? It dries my hair nicely lol. It doesn't get as hot as I expected, like my last one did. But it's a nice hairdryer for the price!"
"Great, small, light and does exactly what I need. Who could ask for more?"
"I loved this dryer. It is super light, small and super powerful at the same time. It is very strong and drys very fast. excellent product, I completely recommend."
"I have many fancy and expensive hair dryer but I fell in love with this one when I was staying in the ritz carlton hotel. I notice that it is foldable, drys fast, and not too hot--just everything i needed for a hair dryer. So I ordered this one from amazon and I have been using this for years, still works great!"
"This dryer is not as powerful as most but that is a good thing. Leaves my hair soft and shiny, not dried out or frizzy."
I love this blow dryer. It's very light.<br />I didn't really notice quicker drying times than my old CHI dryer which I loved.<br />I gave it to my daughter and I got this one for myself. Good product.
Always wanted one of these and this one is great quality so far. My hair is so straight and tangle free. So much easier than using a comb and dryer with both hands.
"Good hair dryer for the money, seriously. I've had one just like it for almost 8 years, love it. So this one for less than $10 is awesome!"
"I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago and really love it.  I had read the reviews about the cord not being a spiral stretch cord and that is why I bought this one.  I have a linen closet next to my vanity and there is a plug-in inside the closet.  I hang the dryer in there out of sight so when I take it out to use, it has a much longer cord then a spiral cord and I need the extra length to reach my vanity so it works perfect for me.  So if you are looking for the spiral cord do not buy this unit, but if you need a longer cord this is the one for you."
Love how lightweight & compact this blow dryer is!  Air concentration is great due to style/shape of the nozzle!  Easy to travel with & drys great!  It is more powerful & drys better than other higher watt blow dryers i've owned in the past.  Would highly recommend this product (& already have)!
This is the best blow dryer ever. Gets super hot I was using The Chi deep brilliance dryer for my Dominican blowouts which was good but this twin turbo cuts my blowouts to half the time and gets far more straighter with just the blow dryer. You've got my vote.
"This thing has so much power, it will nearly blow the hair right off your head!!!  :)"
This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don't have any frizz problems. Other hair dryers don't seem to put out as much hot air so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air. I've not had any problems with the cord and it's lightweight and easy to maneuver.<br />Recommended!
I really like that the cord retracts.  Good force of air.  Nice that you can change speeds and/or heat settings.  I like that you can set it to cool or if you are using a heat you could do a blast of cool with the button.  Slightly heavier than I would like but not unreasonably so.
"I purchased the Leopard print Babyliss Nano Titanium Portofino 6600 Hair Dryer.  It definitely cuts the drying time for my hair.  I am glad that the 'cool' setting is indeed that, COOL AIR, not just unheated air.  My hair has appeared shinier with less frizz.  I am very happy with this purchase."
"This product is great. Very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows. Works great and I can dry my hair right after the shower, no need to wait anymore. Highly recommended."
I love this hair dryer. My friend had it and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself. It comes with the two attachments and the different heat settings are great if you need to dry your hair quickly or if you are taking your time to style.
"This is exactly what I was looking for!  I stayed in a hotel in NYC and this is the hair dryer they had in the bathroom. It was so good that I wrote down the model so I could order it when I got home.  It dries well, folds up perfectly to fit in my cabinet, and the cord even pulls in so I can easily store it or pack it."
"I love that Andis 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer!  It's powerful enough for my short hair, but not too powerful. It's compact so it'll be great for travel."
The best travel dryer I have found. So much power in this little thing.
"Good drying power in a small, very packable dryer.  Delighted to find it here.  Bought one for my daughter as well."
Liked it.  The cord is definitely shorter than normal. Liked it because I feel it dries well but not at the expense of my hearing.
"Had one that finally wore out and loved it so much bought another one just like it! You don't have to worry where to put it, it's on the wall!"
This Conair product is my favorite. This is the best dryer. I have bought it as a back-up for travel to the same<br />model that I bought awhile back. It is a great dryer and functions a long time. My very first was purchased<br /> some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use. I highly recommend it.
This blow dryer is great . I use it all the time.  Mainly on extensions.  Have not tried it on natural hair (4a-4c) yet.  It should be fine.  Makes drying my hair so much faster and easier
"Never heard of this brand before, but found it in a boutique hotel and was very pleased with so I ordered it from Amazon.  Really reduces drying time which results in smoother hair.  Highly recommend."
Easy to use. It is quiet and soft. Not burn your hair. Cool dryer option is also great to use.
I mention that comes with both attachments in the subject because I was confused when I first bought it I thought it came just with the concentrator not with the diffusor but what was my surprise when I opened the box it came with both which are wonderful! I have curly hair and it worked perfectly on me
we liked this so much we bought them for the rest of the bathrooms! convenient and easy to install. it even has a tiny night light built into it.
"I needed a replacement dryer.  This does the job. It's super light, and cute looking.  At first I didn't think I would like it because it seemed really lacking in power.  However, it dries hair EXTREMELY quickly, so the lack of power isn't an issue."
"This is a great, lightweight hair dryer. I have very thick Hirt hair and this dryer dries it quickly and nicely."
"This is great blow dryer.  Heat and speed setting are wonderful.  I have past shoulder length hair, set it on half heat, dries within 7 minutes and not frizzy!"
"I bought this to take with me when I travel as the one I had used before did not have the Ionic thing.  I had not even tried it out for myself when my grandson took it and uses it every day.  He raves about it, so I guess if a picky 18 year old likes it, then there is nothing more to be said!  The cord really does retract quickly, so watch out!"
"I love this hair dryer.  I have fine, thin, hightlighted hair and it is the best blow dryer I have ever used.  Highly recommend."
better price than walmart. can't live without it!
I use this to style my epic beard. It is great. The only down side I can thik of is the attachment only fits this hair dryer. This is a great hair dryer at a great price.
"Excellent product, compact and powerful with ion generator and cool green nightlight (LED). Nice design , Built in Ground fault protection and thoughtful cord hook. Very easy to mount and fairly quiet in operation, especially on low speed."
I bought this to use when travelling because of it's compact size. But it works so well I've been using it everyday.  The cord stores easily inside the  handle and the temperature is perfect -- not too hot and not too cool. I added the attachment and found it performs better with it on. Has great power and doesn't make my hair frizzy or staticy. The only complaint I have is the strong plastic smell when I first opened the box. I've used it for a week now and I don't smell it anymore. I really do love this hairdryer.
I ordered this on 8/2 recieved it priority mail on 8/5.... That is great customer service. I ordered all three kinds of units because I wanted it to be convient for my son(with new braces) to use.  I installed redibreeze and the quick breeze in two different bathrooms.  Both were easy to install... worked great the first time.  Have not installed the shower unit yet  but expect it to be just as easy.  This is a great product... works really well to clean my between my teeth and the holes left by wisdom teeth removal.. Easy for my son to use with his braces.... I have not used a waterpik but cannot imagine how it would work better.  My only idea for the company might be to make a model that you can insert salt tablets or other kind of dissolving disinfectant into so you can get a salt water spray.   Along the same ideas they use for car washing.       Thanks for a great product... and Thanks for fast delivery
"This delivers more blowing power than I have experienced before, which requires me to use the middle setting for my long, curly hair. My husband likes the high setting for a quick dry. Perfect for both of our diverse needs."
"After going on vacation and this blow dryer being in my hotel room, I found out which model it was and immediately bought it online! It is the best hair blow dryer I have ever owned, I love it still going strong 2 years later. I am Samoan, I have a lot of hair and it gets done in less than 10 minutes. Thank you!!"
Really good hairdryer. Purchased this one after our other Conair (who's still going strong!) was just getting too old. Speeds are nice and it doesn't burn you like our other one did. Also surprisingly very light!
"In the days when I had hair to blow dry,most handhelds just either were too hot,or just plain sucked. I got this for my wife and she has beautiful thick hair,if she's happy with it,it's a winner!"
"Fantastic hair dryer! Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair. I decided on xtava because of the good reviews and so glad I purchased it.  The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  My hair comes out super smooth.  It is very powerful and not super noisy. Another great feature is the removable back to clean out lint! I was also really impressed with the welcome letter from the company I received via email after I received the dryers with tips on blow drying my hair. Would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone I know."
I had to replace my old Conair that finally quit on me.  I like that this one has a folding handle and a retractable cord for easy packing if you are traveling.  I have always trusted Conair's products and this one is great.
"I'm really enjoying the use of this product. It heats well and I'm usually dry in 30 minutes. I love how light weight it is, because I can hold it in my lap while I either work on the computer or watch TV."
"This is by far a Classic Fragrance from Polo.  Polo Sport, still going strong a great classic must have from the 90's."
It has several heat settings and several speeds.  The options are great!
"I have a vacation rental close to a nationally known hike/bike trail and many of my guests are here for recreational activity.  In 3 years, I've only had to replace one of these units and everybody seems to love them."
dries quickly
"Never thought the blow dryer made a big difference....always thought it was the styling products...guess again,this will be the only blow dryer i will ever use or buy again.... awesome for curly hair."
I have used this blow dryer for about three years now and I love it. My daughter is constantly stealing it from me so I just purchased one for her birthday. Would you believe that was her favorite gift?
"Great hairdryer!  Used one for several days in a hotel in Canada and liked it so much I ordered it when I got home.  Sort of rubberized handle makes it non-slip, has 2 speeds for both heat and air flow, very lightweight so my arm does not get as tired, not as loud as so many others are, does a great job."
Gift for my wife.  Received quickly and just as described
"Teenage daughter &#34;had to have&#34; one of these. Reluctantly, I bought. Been a superb product without issues since purchase and she uses literally daily. Would buy again, but hope I don't have too! Smiles..."
"This thing runs day and night at my house and is still going many months later , what more do you need to know"
"Best Hairdryer going. Big powerfull, lasts yaears and years.<br /><br />This is about teh third one I have purchased and I hope they keep making them.."
"The best hair dryer, ever! Always leaves my hair straight with lots of body. I've had my first one for at least 7 years. I was trying to share it with my sister & her daughter. Now, I'm having my own daughter soon, so I gave my sister the first one & I bought another one."
"We first used one in a hotel we stayed and my commented that exactly what we need for home. So I did a search and found them on Amazon and the rest is history.  We love it.<br /><br />Thanks,"
I love it the product works great. it is not loud and it gets really hot. It was definitely worth the buy. Fast shipping too
Christmas present. Wife is pleased. What more can I say? It seems like a well made quality item. Nuff' said.
My old faithful Conair finally died and this dryer was the replacement...and a dandy one it has turned out to be.  It dries very quickly compared to my older model and it is lighter weight and easier to handle.  No problems of any kind.  Good purchase.
"I was recommended this blowdryer by a good friend, who was also recommended it by a friend. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it nice and smooth. I had my old dryer for over 4 years, and the change in my hair's texture and the amount of time it took to dry my hair was huge. I would recommend this to anyone, and I really like the look and style of it."
"Amazon was very responsive, but the manufacturer did not mail out the product to my home in an appropriate amount of time. The distributor had to be prodded by Amazon to fulfill my request. The product is just perfect for my wife, but the delay was not pleasant."
Handy product for B & Bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light.
Can't believe I was able to get it for such a great price.  This is my 2nd T3 dryer.  This one is so much lighter.  Love it..
This is the best standard blow dryer on the market.Plenty of power and heat.Nothing else compares.This will keep that 80's hair blown back for shure.This was made for Bon Jovi & Rod Stewart types.
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT. Very strong wind and make my hair dry much faster. can't live without it,"
"A replacement for another Conair, this one is the best. There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted. I use the low setting (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter. The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn't buy a dryer without one. Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out. We ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search. Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced. This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value."
"I discovered this hair dryer while on a vacation with my husband. It was a high end hotel that we stayed in. I was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional. The retractable cord is a bonus. It's not the quietest hair dryer but, it isn't obnoxious, either. You gotta expect some noise with that much power. I love it."
"This is a great hair dryer! It is a little heavy but it works so well, who cares. It has great temperature settings and dries hair fast!"
LOVE LOVE LOVE! It seriouskl y dried my hair half the time made it feel silky smooth its quiet compared to my drug store ones. Omg it's awesome. Buy it
I love this hair dryer.  Using the attached comb makes it very easy to dry my hair. Two thumbs up.
"I love this hair dryer. It has amazing power, yet is drying my hair very gently. My hair feels smooth after drying it which is a huge improvement compared to my previous hair dryer."
"For a small, compact hair dryer its great for traveling! I have little time and thick, curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful. Reasonable price, traveling case and attachments, very happy!"
Great dryer! Dries fast... The hottest setting is really hot so be careful not to burn yourself!
"I love it and Use is very convenient<br /> This product is valuable, and the price is not expensive, worth buying!"
"This works awesome! Great or long thick hair. I love the speed and the cooling feature actually works, others that Ive had do not really feel cooler..this works great for a finished look."
I first saw this product at my hairdresser's salon while she was blowing drying my daughter's hair.  This product was wonderful. It made her hair soft and light and dried her hair within minutes.  It also straightens the hair which my daughter loves as her hair is natural.  I also tried it on my relaxed hair and it did the same thing.  Awesome product.
"I saw this at my sister in laws, she has one in each bathroom and loved it. Its out of the way and always neat looking. It has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom, convenient but out of the way also. Power cord is long enough but not too long. Love it, love it, love it!!"
"This is perfect! I love that it is really strong, my hair gets dry pretty fast. I also like the 3 different intensities."
"i am completely satisfied, i have a long, strong, thick hair, and it works for me as good as  the proffessional blowers i used to have. I just hope it last. I like it very much. Good price, very light, even the colors of this hair blower are nice and they delivered on time. Thanks."
Delivery is fast! I received the item in excellent brand new condition. This flat iron does what it says and even more. It cuts half the time of straigthening my daughters hair. Leaves it very shiny and natural looking without the hassle. It heats up very fast and the temperature is adjustable to fit anyone's type of hair. I love it!!!
Love it. Highly recommend it.
It dries my hair so fast!  I love it and would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good hair dryer at a low price.
Just got it and works great so far but then the first I got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke.  Not a lot of use.  Thought I would give sunbeam one more try.  Will update later.
I have no regrets about purchasing this hair drier. It does not frizz my hair at all and is easy and quick to use :)
"OK, I never write reviews, but this hair dryer is so great, I just had to. It looks very basic, but it is everything you could want in a hair dryer and more. It is powerful, quiet, dries my hair in a flash, and from the very first time I used it, it made my hair amazingly soft and shiny. I didn't even know a hair dryer could make that much difference! This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used."
This hair dryer is worth the price.  It drys my hair much faster then my Chi ever did and the cuticle on my hair stays down more so I don't have the fly away look.  My hairdresser recommended this hair dryer.
I just love my new hair dryer and gets my hair nice and straight without getting to hot. It comes with two attachments and is priced right for me.
"I LOVE this hair dryer!!!! I can't remember the last time my hair looked so shiny and smooth after blow drying it. I am so glad I spent a little more and got a quality hair dryer finally. I can't believe how great my hair looks after just one use! I will update my review if necessary, but if my results continue it won't be necessary! Highly recommend this awesome dryer!!"
"My wife just loves it heat, power and abilities.  She saw it on board a cruise ship and simply loved it and purchased it right after we got back home."
I love my Wall mount hair dryer. It's right there when I need it. I would highly recommend this to<br />all my friends!
"The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage.  The girls liked it so much I bought another one - definitely a good value.  Keeps the dryer handy but out of the way.  And as a bonus they hadn't changed the mounting system so I just pulled the old one off the wall, adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in."
This product is well made & was an excellent purchase. It is used constantly. Has variable heat setting. The night light is particularly useful in the bathroom when it's dark. I will be buying more for my other bathrooms.  Good value for money.
Love it! Dries my hair quickly. Has lots of settings. The cord doesn't is long and doesn't tangle. Easy to clean the back screen. And I Love the cold shot button. Yeah and I love that it's Red...Pretty:) AWESOME Dryer.
Love Love Love this hair dryer.  This is my 3rd one over the course of many years.  I not only use in my home but in my RV.  Great power and the size is just right .  Hangs on wall and that is a plus because it's at you fingertips when needed.  This one just purchased replace one I have had for 10 years........they last a good long while. Highly recommend!
"This is exactly the hair dryer I wanted - light and comfortable enough to grip and operate with one hand while steadying a wet dog in the other.  It produces the perfect temperature to dry doggy fur. And it's got an easy-to-use heat-release button that's very handy if you worry you might be crisping your dog and want a moment of cooler air. I'm sure it would be great for people, too. but I've never tried it so can't comment on that.<br /><br />One bit of advice - the appliance comes with a safety feature on the cord.  Until certain steps are taken, the hair dryer won't work.  Don't try to figure it out on your own, just read the instructions that come in the box.  Once you've followed them, you'll be able to turn on your appliance.  It isn't necessary to do this EVERY time, just the first time, and I'm glad to have the extra safety feature."
awesome product. Tucked out of the way in the female's bathroom of my home. I also purchased one for the male's bathroom in the house and will put in the master bathroom once I am complete with the remodel so if I ever get married again she will have one to use. great night light also. never have to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night..
"This is a nice hair dryer, like that is has three blower settings. Works well on my think long hair, easy grip handle."
I am very happy with my new hair dryer. It drys my hair faster and does not heat it up so that it looks frizzy. I recommend this dryer. It is heavy but that is not a problem and the buttons are fine right where they are.
"This one replaced the last Remington that I had (and loved) since 2002! I have very long hair that's color treated, and these types of hair dryers are a life saver.  I hope this one lasts 13 years... added bonus... it matches my purple-accented bathroom.  :)"
This is a great unit. Compact put full of power.  I wish this was the standard unit used by hotels.  Highly recommended.
I like this hair dryer very much. It hangs on the wall so one does not have to get it out and plug it in. It also has a nice nightlight built in and that's handy in a dark bathroom.
"Salon quality dryer.  Great size and color. Love that its so quite. I've had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle.(my old one was on the inside) but it's well worth it.  My hair dries so fast I have extra time in the mornings.. Love it, Love it, Love it.<br />I would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer. Four year warranty. Where can you find that on a hair dryer?"
"I absolutely love this hair dryer. It's super cute, sleek and looks professional. It has a lot of functions and it drys my hair fast."
This dryer was more than I expected.  I had an old 1875.  It dries my hair so quickly and the settings are great.
I got this hairdryer for my daughter and after seeing the results had to get one for myself.  I have very curly hair that is always frizzy in summer so matter what products you use.  This is the only hairdryer that seems able to dry my hair (in hundred plus degree summer heat and humidity) and keep away the frizz.  Best investment every.
"Very happy with this blower dryer so far. Everything works just right. Small, light. Long power cord is great benefit too."
OMG I love this blow dryer.  I just recently replaced my old blow dryer with this one and I can see a huge improvement in my hair.  It dries quickly and stores nicely.  Love this!
"Thank you thank you thank you for making a hair dryer with a retractable cord.  I cannot express how wonderful this feature in particular is!  The jury is still out on the dryer itself as I've not had it long enough to know its durability/reliability, but so far so good."
"Packaging was excellent, this is exactly what I was looking for, great for day time (using light colors) and for night time of course using dark shades. This is a great product with great price.<br /><br />I originally wanted to by bare escentuals eye shadows but they are bit expensive, especially if you are not going to use such eye shadows that are needed for (Pakistani/Indian wedding) parties, then do not buy something expensive as mac or bare escentuals, no doubt mac and BE got great makeup but its too expensive.<br /><br />So I definitely recommend this makeup because its good, stays on and great price!"
"I got this hair dryer for Christmas, and I love it! The retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom, The attachments work really well and my hair dries quickly. The only &#34;iffy&#34; thing about it is it doesn't seem to get as hot as my old dryer, but this may actually be better for my hair."
"Great hair dryer.  And the price was great too.  It's sturdy.  It is a little hard to get used to with the controls being on the inside of the handle, but once you do it's super.  I use it on my dog after his shampoo and he likes it too.  :).  Would recommend."
"I researched various black on-wall hairdryers and I liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way. I mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer, but it's actually come in handy for me as well. Anyway, mount and forget this thing. The cord for how I mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit, but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit. After two-years, it's still working great and gets a decent amount of use. No problems whatsoever."
"I love it, it fits my little peanut head just fine and really snug. I used it to deep condition my hair with a plastic cap and silk bonnet on top then the hair dryer bonnet. I used the silk bonnet to protect my ears and neck from getting to hot. This is the first time I have ordered this and I'm very happy."
Purchased this blow dryer based on a recommendation from my hair stylist. One of the best investments I've made in years. Powerful but light enough to maneuver easily. It doesn't weigh your arm down. Worth every penny.
"Love, love, love it.  Its not very heavy or particularly loud and the amazing thing is, it actually reels the cord in!!"
It blows.  Hot.  Really well.  Amazing stamina.  Plug it in and it never stops.  Not expensive.
very fast drying experience!
good quality and lasts a long time...
So far so good.  Light weight for my 87 yr old mom to hold.  Just hope it holds up.
Took to Argentina for a month and it worked great.  I actually like it better than my regular hair dryer.  Just follow the directions for dual voltage and you will have no problem.  This does not come with an adaptor which I had to bring myself.
Used this hair dryer in an expensive hotel and had to buy one for home. Love retractable cord. Good power. Fits nicely in drawer since it folds.
Purchased this for a trip to Italy where suitcase space was such a premium.  It performed just like a full size model and I absolutely LOVE it!
"all hair dryers should have just the &#34;cool&#34; air function.  I like it, others like it the cool air is powerful and I think it does not make my hair fall off. get it."
"Love this dryer. I've been using wall mount hair dryers for years. Actually only one before this one which was also a Sunbeam. Nothing lasts forever. Loved the Sunbeam before this one and this one is really good too. Slender look, night light, two speeds, doesn't seem to get hot. Looks nice on the wall. Have only had this one for a month, but if it's anything like the old one it will last for years."
Small. cheap and works well for what it is. Don't expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling.
My wife loves this hair dryer. Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely. Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers. Other wise your hair really won't dry or curl. The hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair.
"Amazed no one has given thumbs up on this hair color product.  Naturcolor is the best permanent herbal based hair color I've ever used.  After many professional hair color mishaps, I decided to go it on my own, and that was a decade ago, when I found Naturcolor at my local health-market.  I've gotten many compliments on my highlights, and natural color.  It doesn't strip my hair, and doesn't turn it artificially yellow.  Why isn't everyone using Naturcolor?  They should. I use Sesame Blond 9N on the roots, leaving it for about 20 minutes, then I put the left overs just on the top of my hair for another 5 minutes and shampoo, and I am summer blond. You'll save a lot on stylist fees and have a more natural look.   Susan"
I am very pleased with this product.  I like it even more than the others I have used in many hotels rooms--it's quiet but dries my hair really well. I like the nightlight but I unplug it during the day since it isn't sensitive to light/dark.
On a recent trip one of our hotels had this dryer in the room and my wife liked it so much I ordered one.  Now it's her favorite.
"Used this hairdryer in a hotel on vacation and loved it so much I had to order one for home as soon as I got back!  Doesn't have a separate selector for temperature, and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones, but it works just great for me.  Would definitely recommend."
Very powerful and dries hair fast!  I purchased this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.  The wall mount is very handy so it doesn't need rolled up every day like traditional ones.
"WE USED THIS HAIR DRYER IN A HOTEL ONCE AND LOVED IT SO MUCH WE HAVE ONE IN EVER BATHROOM (7) IN THE HOUSE...  WE LIVE AT THE BEACH SO WHEN WE HAVE COMPANY THEY USE THE HAIR DRYERS AND THEY LOVE THEM..  TWO OF OUR FRIENDS LIKED THEM SO MUCH THEY BOUGHT ONE FOR THEIR HOUSES.......  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THE HAIR DRYER WITH THE NIGHT LIGHT, THE LIGHT WON'T LAST LONG, JUST BUY THIS ONE IT'S THE BEST........"
I love this dryer. This is my third one. I have purchased more expensive ones and this one is still better. The air flow is more directed so I get smooth hair without fly-aways like so many new dryers. It has a good temp as well.
"Lightweight, quieter than most, and dries my hair in half the time! All dryers are NOT the same and this one is great for smoothing and straightening!"
"Exceptional dryer...I love this hair dryer!<br />It is quiet, really quiet for a powerful dryer.  It's comfortable to use/hold.<br />I am really glad I chose this one.  There is nothing negative for me to say.<br />I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend the Ovente X3."
"Awesome blow dryer, and flash of cold heat, Love the way my hair feels Thanks Amazon!!!"
"Got this for my mom, who wanted a dryer with a strong &#34;blow.&#34; I have a Remington that is great (but that model is no longer available), so I got her this one based on other positive reviews, and she really likes it."
"I bought this for my wife because I became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer, I found it deafening from down the hallway but she's running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :-)<br /><br />This one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.<br /><br />The jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not, but after a couple weeks' use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too."
Works great cools itself Down would buy again
I have a Conair hair dryer that I use at home.  I bought this one for a trip to the UK because of the dual voltage feature and compact size.  My trip is in three weeks so I am yet to try it out overseas yet but it arrived quickly and does seem very lightweight and easy to pack.
Great hair dryer. Drys my hair quickly with less frizzy/dried out hair. Would definiitely recommend this hair dryer to all
"I was looking for a folding handle hair dryer with a retractable cord and this one is perfect! It has more features than I expected, based on the online description. I was pleased to find out there are multiple temperature and speed settings, and it is so much more quiet than other hair dryers I've purchased. I love it!"
"What a great blow dryer for an even better price! This was recommended to my by my stylist and I'm so glad I didn't spend the big bucks on a salon brand dryer. This dryer makes such a huge difference in my hair compared to the Revlon I used to use. My hair takes half the time to dry and looks shiny and smooth when finished, just like it looks when leaving the salon. A great blow dryer really does make all the difference. Save your money and get this one, you won't regret it!"
Bought this to replace an old Sunbeam that burned out. Looks exactly like the Sunbeam one and even used same mounting plate already on the wall. Nice!!
"I bought this wall-mounted dryer to free-up some space in the kids bathroom, and it works great. The nightlight is nice and bright and the dryer isn't too loud. The bracket mounted easily once I pounded the raised Ground screw terminal flat. The bracket won't lay flat against the wall with the raised Ground screw terminal on the bracket. The cord hook on the dryer mounted easily and works wonderfully. I've only had it a couple of weeks, but everyone in the family really likes it."
"My old, reliable hair blower was dying, and I looked around for something similar.  I found the Andis, and it's great!  Light weight (very important) and terrific drying capability.  Mater of fact, I bought it before my other one died, so it was in the ready.  Great choice for a hair blower."
"Found this hair dryer while on business while staying at one of the Marriots.  I could not believe how fast it dried my hair, with very low heat and lots of air, not to mention how shiny it was.  So I decided to order my very own. My hair has never been easier to dry and style.....and best of all my precious dog gets his fur blown out by this hair dryer as well and his fur is dry at super speed.  What a great product and great price.  Last year i purchased one of these fancy dryers and all of a sudden it stopped blowing out hot air, what a waste....but perfect timing for this little baby.  I am hooked on this one."
"Purchased this over two months ago and it is the best hairdryer I've ever used!! I get disappointed whenever I use any other hair dryer because it's simply not the same! Very strong power, dries hair fast and easily. Perfect temperature for me as well. Very happy with my purchase! Thank you!"
"dries fast, quiet, sleek. bought for my dad for christmas to replace an old remington he had that also had the dual motor. works very quickly and it very nice looking. lasts a long time too. my dad had his old remington for 6 years! lol it was time for an upgrade. im sure hell have this another 6... ha"
"I love this hairdryer! It dries my hair in well over HALF the time my old one did. The removable back allows you to clean all the lent and stuff that gets in there over time. It's perfect, and it comes with a ton of attachments."
"Great Product!  Easy to use, quite stylish (and how important is that when one is blow drying their hair!).  Dries hair quickly without any frizz.  The cord even retracts!  It has multiple heat and power settings.  Appears to have a long shelf life, unless you drop it.  Word to the wise,  take care not to drop it on a hard floor.  This is my second one."
"I like this because of the three speed settings and three heat settings.  I just like having the options.  I also like that the cord is fairly long.  Some are just too short and you have to stay so close to the outlet.  I will say, though, if you like your dryer to get super HOT this may not be the one for you.  It does get really warm but not &#34;burn your skin&#34; hot like some of them!  I'm happy with it."
"I had another  blow dryer just like this one and it finally died on me.  I went in search of it at all the local stores.  I couldn't find it, so I bought a couple other ones that I ended up returning, because I didn't like them.  Therefore, I was pretty happy when I found this close match on Amazon.  I'm very happy with it."
"Easy to install,  Makes for a great night light in the bathroom with the blue little LED colored light strip, Works fabulously"
"Used it at a hotel and had to have one. This is the best hair dryer I have ever used. Dries fast cuts drying time in half, and doesn't make my hair frizzy. Highly recommend it!!"
This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned!! It is worth every penny.. I went to my local Sally's and bought two they were 35.00 each.. I had to buy a new one due to my daughter dropped it and Sally's does not have these so I found it on Amazon thank goodness.. If you drop this dryer it will break easily and there is no repairing it. Your hair looks great when you use this one... I will never plan to buy another dryer except this one.. I can't say enough love this one so I highly recommend this dryer..
"I recently became aware of Xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer. I wanted the ceramic ionic technology as I have baby fine hair which tends to break and attract static way too easily. This hair dryer has been amazing. It's super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great. I can usually dry my hair in about 4 to 5 minutes. I use the dryer with a flat brush, and have noticed my hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.<br /><br />I also have to say that Xtava has excellent customer service. When I originally purchased the dryer, Amazon fulfilled the order and shipped the wrong one. Xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with Amazon. I now own two Xtava dryers and love them both. I'm really happy with my purchases, and the quality of the Xtava products. I highly recommend this dryer."
Powerful blow dryer. I love it. I use it for my hair and I use it after giving my poodle and Maltese a bath. I highly recommend this blow dryer. Will purchase again from this seller.
"A great dryer.  Always handy, but not in the way.  This is our second one and the first one lasted a long time."
"Fast blow drying,travel size, lightweight and great price. What more could I need? I am a  professional hair stylist, but I use this for personal drying. Works or me!"
"The hair drier is as it was described, the price was really good and my daughter and her long hair are very pleased with the drier.<br /><br />The United States Parcel Post took 22 days to deliver it.  It would be worth spending an extra bit of change to get a faster delivery."
Excellent quality and ergonomics. Love the green light. Good temperature and air flow. Installed 2 of them. Easy to install with wall mollys from local Walmart as the ones that came with the unit were not suitable.
"I bought this product because I have the hair serum, which I liked also, and smells nice.  I tried the shampoo today and being that today is an extremely humid day, the product held up nicely.  My hair had no tangles and smells so pretty.  I will purchase this again.  When I began shampooing I felt my hair was not feeling dry and all tangled like some others I've tried, and I've tried all the well known ones.  It felt soft and shiny.  Kind of silky."
Love this dryer. Have one in every bathroom and gifted one to my daughter. So easy and so reliable. Has never let me down.
"This dryer is the perfect combination of small size, power and quick drying.  I purchased one several years ago and when it finally died I tried to replace it with a more expensive and larger one, but wasn't as happy with that one so I bought another one of these.  Is it perfect? No, but pretty close.  I haven't had the problems that others have had.  If it were redesigned I would suggest making the switch a bit easier to move and make the focus attachment stay in position more securely (it spins around too easily)."
"This hair dryer is attractive and a good hair dryer.  My hair can sometimes be frizzy, but with this dryer, I can get it nice and smooth.  I dry it all the way and then use the cold blast for smooth hair."
"I tested this hair dryer at a Ritz Carlton and loved it - didn't even unpack my own.  I ordered one upon my return and have been using it daily for over a month.  My short, permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out.  This dryer is fantastic!  The retracting cord works smoothly, too."
"This hairdryer has great power and different heat settings. The price and quality are great, it is very heavy duty. The automatically recoiling cord is a bonus!"
"I'm a professional stylist. This dryer is powerful, it works great for any type of hair. The 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair, I really like it! Great for professionals and personal use too. You can't go wrong with Twin Turbo, they are great dryers. Thank you."
"This dryer is wonderful, the power you have is second to none .., a little heavy but worth it for the results it leaves. I am very happy."
"Good, handy little hair dryer that I can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink.  I'm a head shaver so I only needed this for my son (occasionally) and for guests.  Works great."
"Love this hair dryer, I'm a hairstylist I need a hair dryer that drys hair quickly and light in weight because I have to hold it so much throughout the day.<br />I highly recommend."
"I am picky about hairdryers because they always make a very loud sound but I feel like the power and force just isn't there. This Conair I have been very happy with.It is strong and take an adequate time to dry my hair. If this ever dies, I will buy this same dryer again."
"I like it... it is very easy to use and to handle it is also very practical if you want to take it for travel ... My hair gets dry very quick I was surprise with the power of this dryer I thought it might be too low, but not.  yes buy it  is a good product and cheap ...one year warranty .."
"This is everything I need in a hair dryer. I have medium-textured wavy hair, and the diffuser really helps make the most of my curls and waves. They turn out with great volume and shine (my husband says my hair is &#34;fluffy--but in a good way&#34;), and less frizz than I get with letting my hair air dry. Overall, the product does its job and I am very pleased."
Great dryer if you don't like the newer types which have gadgets added to them and are very powerful.  This has a powerful setting but not extremely strong so that your hair is getting a beating.
New to hair dryers but does everything it should and a bit more.
LOVE IT. Works well. I don't think I'd have paid the original price. Glad I got a deep discount. I does dry my hair faster and it honestly does seem smoother.
"i love being able to just sit under the dryer and read while i deep condition my hair. not too hot, and it covers my entire head. fast shipping and good pricing for hot tools!!"
"But my first one was $300! I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features! I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers, is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn't blow my hair all over at the high setting - it is very pleasant to use. Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn't notice that this one was not until it was already shipping. I decided to see if it was heavier, and it is not. So I am completely satisfied! I bring this with me to nice hotels because it's always better than whatever they provide."
"I bought this to replace the exact same one I had purchased 15 years ago. The old one just stopped working on the high setting, but still works on low. Very handy, nice design with the night light feature, keeps the hair dryer out of the way. I was happy to find the exact same item - I got a good 15 years worth of use out of the old one, so I can't complain."
"Compact, easy to travel with.  Puts out plenty of air.  Works very well."
"The ideal hair dryer, small yet powerful."
This dryer is what I wanted at a reasonable price. It was easy to put on the wall.
Great dryer works fast and has a long cord so you can move around.
"Very lightweight, so great for long uses."
great product exactly what I expected
"Great value for the money. Faster drying without overheating one's hair, when compared to our previous hair dryer."
I like this dryer.  Much easier on my hair and much better than higher heat dryers.
Great dryer at a very reasonable price!  Has more than enough power to get the job done quickly and is very convenient by being always accessible.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.
easy to mount and dries hair very efficiently without counter clutter.
"This small compact dryer is so perfect for my wash and go hair do and does just what I want it to do to my hair.  I really love it and get my hair done in less than five minutes. I'm sure the cut has a lot to do with it as well, so they go hand in hand."
"Such a good sized hair dryer for the price. This is not a mini, it is a full size hair dryer. has warm and hot setting, basic and durable."
"Dries my hair very quickly, and dries it straight. I have wavy hair and this hairdryer gets the wave out if I want to."
I had always wanted a Ceramic Blow Dryer.  Leaves my hair smoother and less flyaways.  Great product for the money.
"I am able to dry my hair faster, this dryer is simple, powerful and it's easy to handle! Love it!"
"So far it is all that it promised works well, and is very compacted would I recommend it Yes.. very pleased..."
Bought this to use on a recent trip to Africa. Worked perfectly and was the solution to managing my hair in the third world. I left it there with a young lady who couldn't afford to buy one for herself.  Two happy girls.
"I LOVE this hair dryer.  I have medium-long but thick hair, and my hair dries in literally 1/3 to 1/2 the time of my old hair dryer.  Comes with the two separate attachments (directional and diffuser) and then both work great and attach firmly but easily.  Great product!"
My husband I travel a lot.  There are times we need a blow dryer.  The dryer is small and doesn't weigh much.  We keep it in our suitcase all the time.  Its perfect!
a great budget hairdryer and its also pink. that in itself is enough to love. glad I got this product and it shipped fast.
"A stylist recommended this to me as it is the model they use.  It is lightweight, compared to what I had been using, is super powerful and does my hair faster."
"nice size, color and not heavy weight. It works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy. It doesnt take too much time to dry my hair. Folding handle and retractable wire are really useful . Very happy with that."
"pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again"
"This ranked second in dryers in my price range; the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting. I love this dryer- works fast, strong flow, retractable cord is a plus, hand weight is comfortable."
I have been using the Andis Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer for years.  My first one (1600W) gave up the ghost several years ago so I replaced it with their newest model (1875W) at that time. Seeing I have had good performance with this dryer I decided to buy a back-up.
"I do not buy anithing without try it first. But this blower its really great. its fast and powerfull, and reduce the time of drying in half. I love this product."
This is a great product and the price half of what you would pay at a salon.
"This is a really nice mild smelling body wash that certainly does wonders for dry skin. Love it. Ordered it twice,esp. at ths sale price."
"Powerful and has a REALLY hot setting, a warm setting and button for &#34;cool&#34; which has no heat at all.  It's very good and I'm very pleased.  My last Conair of a similar model is still going strong after many years and we've used to to defrost the freezer when it was broken for a few months (had to defrost it every week), and I used it as my own hairdryer and as a dog grooming dryer--which is now it's exclusive use (I have a dog grooming business).  So these are workhorse machines!"
Great power and portability! Size is not too small or too large.  I would recommend if you want a powerful travel dryer.
"Love this hairdryer!  I had no idea that there was such a big difference in hairdryers, but let me tell you, there is.  I had a Ceramic heated Conair hairdryer.  While visiting family, I had to borrow a hairdryer because I forgot to pack mine.  The way my hair looked when it was dry was amazing.  It looked so smooth and shiny.  Not the norm when using my Conair.  I looked at the name brand and took note right away.  So glad I was able to purchase on Amazon."
I needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my BaByliss Pro TT.  The Remington works great.  Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.
"Very pleased with the dryer.  It's a little heavier than my last one, but does a great job. I would recommend."
This hair dryer is AMAZING! I have alot of thick frizzy hair and this blow dryer not only smoothed my ends it did it super fast! Im so happy with my purchase its worth every penny!
"This blow dryer is great. I had a Remington I bought about 6 years ago and it finally died a couple weeks ago. I wanted a replacement that was low energy but just as good at drying. This thing is even better than the last Remington I had. Blows faster, dries quicker, uses less electricity, and is WAY lighter and smaller. Very impressed."
We used a hairdryer like this in a hotel.  It was so powerful that we came home and ordered one.  We love it.  It cuts the drying time in half.  It folds for traveling and has a retractable cord.  We love it!
"I chose this dryer based on the great ratings it got. I am highly pleased with it. Works well, has all the temp. settings needed. I was looking at much more expensive dryers, and I really don't think one of them would have been better. Highly  recommend!"
"I saw this dryer in Good Housekeeping magazine and decided to give it a try, even though I was pretty happy with my current 1875 watt dryer.  This one really is better!  Dries faster, and seems very gentle.  The cooling feature is great for setting curls and body.<br /><br />I ordered a second dryer for my daughter, but when it came there was an unpleasant buzzing sound when running on high speed.  I knew this wasn't right.  I contacted Amazon about the defective product, return shipping was free and easy, and a replacement arrived in two days.  Thanks, Amazon!"
"I really love this hair dryer. My old dryer died and I needed to get a new one quickly. I wanted one that was quiet and dry well. I have an Onei flat iron that I'm very happy with so I was happy to buy the hair dryer. I love the low volume of the hair dryer, love the ionic switch, and it really does dry well. I am happy with my purchase."
"This has to be one of the best hairdryers Ive bought. The plum sparkle coloring is spectacular. It is a little heavy but not real noticeable. The only thing that &#34;erks&#34; me is where the buttons are. If you are use to holding it a certain way, you may have to change that. I miss having a rewindable cord too, but thats okay with me. It is great! My hairstylist even thinks so!"
"Very powerful Hair Dryer.<br /><br />The Warm setting is almost hot, while the Hot setting is nice and toasty :)<br />The cool shot immediately takes effect. That's nice.<br /><br />It came with a couple of accessories to attach to the front, but haven't been able to try them out.<br /><br />Construction seems solid. The wire was thick and insulated.<br /><br />Can't beat it for a $10 dryer."
"my wife is very happy with this purchase. I chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet, light powerful, professional quality. I have found everyting to be as advertised or better. hairblower is VERY QUIET and light to hold. these were impotant factors in choosing this prduct. price was very reasonable. delivery was quick. product was received in pristine condition. I highly recommend this product and seller"
Fabulous little dryer will never go back to another type. Great settings lots of power! Hangs out of the way yet right there when you need it!
"I bought one of these in 2001 for a 3 week trip to Europe.  It's still going strong.  So, I purchased this for a young friend, just graduating from high school and headed to Spain for some future studies. Hopefully, she will have as good luck with her's as I have had!"
"I've been very happy with this so far.  It's very light, and I love that it has three heat (one being no heat) settings and two speed settings, which is more than most dryers have.  The airflow is pretty strong on the high setting.  The setting labels are already wearing off though, after only a few months of regular use."
Love it. Now my hair looks like I just left the salon. Quick dry time and great sheen
"I'm a hairstylist and this was recommended by a couple of coworkers. It recently arrived, but I've used it on a number of clients already and it's great. Strong airflow, high heat, lightweight, cool shot button, and works very well with my diffuser attachment also.  Makes my job much easier!"
Love it. Recieved it quickly. Dries really fast. Only down side is that it vibrates leaving my hand tingly. But its awesome.
This drys my hair in five minutes and I have a ton of fine hair. Much quieter than my last dryer to the point I wondered if it was working right. Works great for over a month now and easy to clean the intake on the end of dust.  Not too big to store in our vanity drawers.
Love this dryer! I noticed a big difference after using just once. Hair felt healthier!
works great - the 2 nozzles come on and off fine - much lighter than my previous dryer.
It is the 2nd one I have purchased. Love it!
Love this dryer. Professional results without the price!
I have been using this brand and dryer for 10 years now.  They last a long time and makes my job as a stylist satisfying.  Its gets the job done great for keratin treatments too
Highly recommend!!!I can even repair your hair!!!
"So convenient on the wall!!! This is my second one, I love it!"
The dryer is light weight and full of options.  I am quite pleased with it and will buy the same brand again..
Excellent hair dryer!  Bought this T3 Featherweight Journey Travel Dryer at Amazon.com with  Zadro Next Generation Lighted Travel Mirror & 12 inch Brown Faux Crocodile Pattern 4 Extendable Trays Doctor Style Makeup Bag.  So looking forward to my next trip...  thanks Amazon!
I love this hair dryer so much that I purchased two more to give to my daughters for Xmas. It is the most powerful hair dryer available with 2000 watts.  It's a professional dryer with a low price.
I bought this as a gift and it worked out amazingly! She loves the product. You would never guess that you could buy such a quality hair dryer at such a cheap price!
"I first purchased the Wall Mount hair dryer for our 5th wheel, and since I have installed them in two bathrooms in our home,    The wife loves them!"
This is a replacement for the same model hair dryer.  The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  I like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter.  I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com
"I have tried a lot of hair dryers in the last 40 years. This one is, by far, the best I have used. It is pricier than the ones you see in the discount stores, but it is worth every penny you pay for it. I recommend it highly."
it is better than what i expect and gives me more than i want. this hair dryer has three shifts which are perfect for me. it also can swithch to the cold model. loves it. highly recommend
"I have very curly hair, and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types."
"This blowdryer has great wind power and delivers a lot of heat - both make it great at styling my very curly hair.  It is a reasonable weight and fits comfortably in my small hands, which makes maneuvering it easy.  I only wish it came with a diffuser attachment."
I amd black and I have natural hair and I can tell you that this blowdryer will be perfect for anyone!
Best blowdryer.Hair will be dry in record time. Only wish the concentration nozzle was permanently attached.
"Rated this five stars because of<br />1) There are 3 temperature features and a bonus cool shot<br />2) There are 2 speeds<br />3) Not heavy & it has a long cord<br />4) The 2 combing and area specific drying pieces<br />5) The great product & low price.<br />This is product is great, and is worth more than the price I payed."
This is the best hairdryer I have ever purchased and used. I feel like I am in a salon every time I blow dry my hair. It is definitely salon quality.
I love this hair dryer.  There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  It seems to dry my hair quicker
I tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home.  The dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz.
My wife says it works great. I had to order it online. The one she had for several years was not performing like it did when she first purchased it (over five years ago.). She would not buy a different type at a store. She would olny accept this one. I am glad I found it for her.
"Great hairdryer! Options for speeds & options for heat settings - exactly what I wanted. And quieter than my last one, which was a bonus! And a fun red, sparkly color too!"
This is an awesome product. I have a mid length hair and it dries them in 5 mins on high-warm setting. There are 2 settings: one for the temperature and the other for speed. So you can choose between cool-warm-hot on one side and low-high on the other end.  The product was delivered on the said delivery date and it is a great value for money.
I wanted this style hair dryer which is very hard to find in stores. This one fit the bill perfectly. Have only used it twice but appears to work fine and was exactly what was advertised. So far I am very please and happy with this product.
Great product.  Dries hair much faster than previous less expensive dryers which stop working after a year.  Attachments weren't in box and merchant had excellent customer service.  Would buy again product from merchant again.  Very happy.  Healthier hair.
Works great for me.  I have limited space and really like how the cord retracts.
Use this for my dog.  It has a mild setting that is just right for him after his bath.  He hates baths. He would not give any thing associated with it 5.
I have been searching for a decent hair dryer that would not cost an arm and a leg.  This hair dryer has far exceeded my expectations on both!  It is an incredible hair dryer - quiet and really powerful and it cost less than $100!!!  And it leaves my hair feeling incredible - no frizz or flyways!
This is the best darn hair dryer. My daugthter asked for her own dryer so I didn't want spend a lot of money on her first dryer. This works way better than mine and I spent 3 times more on mine. It dry's faster and isn't as loud as mine. It's smaller and lighter. I think I might just have to get me one of these also.
"Works great , does what it is supposed to do which is dry hair ..  yes the outer finish starts to peal a little bit around the handle but no big deal .. its a blow dryer not a pair of shoes.  The cost was great too!"
"This Hair Dryer is PERFECT!! Love it!!! Small but, Powerful! I have very thick hair & it dryes it fast. Exactly what I was looking for."
"Very happy so far, I haven't owned this very long but it seems to work very well, it has a lot of settings so I can always find what I need for my hair."
"I forgot to take my hairdryer with me when visiting a friend.  She had this dryer in her guest bathroom and after using it for a few times, I said:  this is the most wonderful little dryer -  I have to get one.  It is so powerful and makes drying not only quick but blows in lots of volume.  I bought one for my home in FL and a second one to take home to my MI home this summer.  I was so happy to locate it so easily by just going to Amazon!"
"Very nice, lightweight, seems to dry hair quickly without frying it. so far very nice, but time will tell how long it will last. great value so far."
"Love it!  Quiet and powerful, cord retracts well."
Powerful and easy to pack on domestic trip.  :)
Best hair dryer I've ever owned. I have really thick hair so I needed a professional grade dryer. It drugs my hair very quickly.
I bought it 3 months back. No problem at all. Serves well. Quickly dries my hair. I mostly use it in medium speed. It's a light weight dryer.
I love this blow dryer. The price was great I have short hair it blows it dry in no time.
"It takes some precision switching fr hot to cool & vise-versa, otherwise it's great & I can mount on the wall folded in half w/no cord."
"This is great for a smaller bathroom - like I have - and it mounted easily on the wall and I use it daily,"
"Totally worth the money, it dries my hair well and quickly.<br />I would definitely recommend it to a friend. I love it!"
ive always really liked the travel sized blow dryers. and this one is wonderful not to heavy and drys my hair in half the time.
"It works as I desired, without blowing my hair with a blast.  It is a gentle air for fine hair."
"I purchased this a while back and still works great. I definitely would recommend to buy this product, worth the money and the item shipped fast! :)"
"I like it so much. Even the button is kind of easy to accidently push, but I don't think it's a big deal."
The cord is a little short - but this machine is strong sturdy and well built.  So far so good.  I'm happy w/the purchase.
I'm a professional hairdresser and unusual buy chi  which are 3 times the cost of this at first I bought 1 to see how I liked it. .I LOVED THIS DRYER needless to say I bought another. been extremely  happy with it..
I would highly recommend this blow dryer. Even my mother-in-law said it is awesome. It is powerful and dries my hair fast. I plan to look at other products made by them as well.
I bought this item for my wife and I ask her if she liked it and she simply said she loved it. I think the retracktable cord is a main reason and the ther is it doesn't make her hais as static as other blow dryers..
Very nice and lighter weight than previous models.  Dries well.
The Nano technology is great. Blow dry is much faster than regular product. Keep my hair style nice (no dryness).
I have two teenage girl's and we have really put this blow dryer through the test. It works great and dries our hair quickly without the frizz. Would highly recommend!
"Works great, low price, arrived promptly.  The speed settings were just right, in terms of low speed getting air through my hair without blowing it around too much and high speed giving a good blast.  The high-low temp worked well also."
"Hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted. Powerful enough... i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter.  And the bonus of the Night Lite ,I overlooked in the description online,  is great for nite trips to the potty. Nite lite can be shutoff if needed.  It sits nice and tidy in the room, up and out of the way of countertop."
Great little dryer
"Mini and cute even not exactly the same color, still beautiful"
This is a great little hair dryer.
"This is the best, fastest hair dryer I've ever used. Unbelievable. Used it in a Marriott a month ago, ordered on-line and I'm thrilled. No comparison to any other hand hair dryer."
Great little dryer. I bought 2 to keep at relatives'  houses for when guests  (like me) visit them.  I have  visited and used both dryers.
"LOVE THE COOL BUTTON, WHICH HOLDS THE STYLE IN PLACE AFTER THE BRUSH IS REMOVED. MY HAIR IS STYLED MUCH BETTER DUE TO SETTINGS....."
"I love my Andis blow dryer!! This thing is great! It gets super hot, has good settings you can adjust if you don't want the hot feature, and it really is professional quality (even though I feel like ALL blow dryers say 'professional').  This has really been a staple, espically since trying to transition from relaxed to natural hair.  The cord could be a tad longer, but I would have a 30 foot cord on all my gadgets if possible so it may just be me.  I would recommend this dryer. I only use one nozzle for it though, I feel like the other nozzles it came with don't fit, however I could just be mixing them up because I've had so many blow dryers throughout the years."
"I had a hair dryer with a retractable cord back in the mid 80s and I've been looking for a replacement to love as much as I loved that one ever since it died after 7 years of service. This is an excellent hair dryer that gives a good flow of air. I don't like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn't get so hot that I feel like it's trying to bake my hair rather than dry it. The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying. It has a good weight that is substantial without being cumbersome and a good-sized grip. My hair is prone to static and this unit doesn't induce that unpleasant state. I had high expectations for the Andis RC-2 Ionic1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord and it didn't disappoint me."
"good hairdryer - cheap, not too big, not too loud and lightweight. dries my hair quickly and it is powerful"
"Bought this to replace my old, compact Conair 1600.  Hard to find a small dryer like this that doesn't have a folding handle, has just the right amount of air velocity at each setting, and doesn't come with a lot of &#34;frou-frou&#34; attachments and improvements.  This dryer is perfect.  Simple, efficient, works great.  I'm happy."
I absolutely love this dryer! It was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot. I would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try.
"This hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer, which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer.  It has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold.  It is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings. I don't think it gets super hot, which is good for me since I have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out.  My hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer."
"I have very thick, curly hair and the power in this dryer does the job in great time!  Thank you!"
"I have very thick wavy hair, and this has been the best hair drier ever. I bought two in fact so that I do not have to carry with me when I visit with my friends."
"After years of having a long magnificent mane...I decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn't enough. I LOVE this hair dryer...I have nearly more long, curly hair than Shakira herself...and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly! I recommend the TRESemme Flawless Curls Defining Gel if you have thick curly hair and need a great dryer with a fantastic diffuser! The Salon quality at an affordable price with a SOLID DIFFUSER that wouldn't lose grip on the dryer is what I sought, and it's exactly what I got!"
Been using this dryer for the past 6 months and it's works great. The hot setting is not &#34;burn your scalp hot&#34; but warm enough to dry your hair rapidly. Great for styling hair also.
Awesome use everyday!!!
"I found this product by accident while trying to find a certain brand of make up on Amazon & because of the price & reviews I decided to purchase it for my 17 year old daughter, who is really into pretty eye shadows.. I have spent a fortune on colorful name brand eyeshadows at the store!    I have to say, my daughter LOVES this eye shadow! I just purchased 2 more of these eye shadow palettes (one for me & another for her) & will continue to buy them! The palette came wrapped tight in bubble wrap & all 88 shades were in perfect condition! I also love the way they are packaged, slim enough to throw in your purse but large enough when you open it that you can easily use the inside mirror to put on the eye shadow, and talk about color options, WOW! They are very vibrant, beautiful colors. It would also make a great affordable gift for anyone you know who loves to have fun with eye shadow!"
XTAVA Rimini iconic hair dryer.is 1800 w .which is perfect for extremely good results for styling and drying your hair with in short period of time.it helps ur hair hair from getting frizzier and more dry looking by different speed for air blow and two power buttons .also contains two attachments.which can be used for focussed precise area u need to style or dry .without affecting the remaining part of the hair.after using the second attachment I am surprised to see the difference in my hair as it looks more shinier and don't forget to use the cool feature after you done drying your hair it gives such a finished look to the hair keeping it more natural and free flowing.i have tried other XTAVA PRODUCTS too like allure and i must say XTAVA.

"This dryer gets very hot, very fast and makes drying my hair take less time. My hair felt softer as well. Great dryer."
"I have a very old Conair Prostyle 1600 - my favorite hand held dryer, and after over 10 years, it's been on its way out.  I've tryed various dryers, but none of them have the great feel of my old Conair.  I just recently ordered the Conair Yellowbird 1875...thought it would be great - looked just like my old one, only yellow.  I tried it once and sent it back.  It was too heavy..unlike the Conair 1600, which was oh so light...and surprisingly didn't have the blow power I expected.  So I read one review on the Andis Pro Style 1600 and it sounded good.  I tried it this morning and it's perfect - very light...and so small, I couldn't believe it.  I travel on business and have not found a travel dryer I'm happy with, so I'm going to order another of these for a travel dryer."
Bought two for guest bathroom and so far it's been perfect. Lots of power in a little size
"I am on my second one of these, I love them so much..I had the original for five years and it started to make a little noise..didn't want to be without one, so I ordered a second,..my best friend is still using it and I have my new one."
"high watts, nice attachments and when i purchased it was a little higher, but still worth the price.  i still use it to this day, the cheery brightens the day too."
it is very powerful?i like it very much!!!!!  it save me a lot of time to dry hair! ho ho
I find it very handy for my daily hair drying. My grand daughter comes here when she is in a hurry to dry her hair.
It came very soon after ordering it.  It performs exactly as it was advertised.  It is very easy to use and the recoiling power  cord is very convenient.
"I bought this dryer because I was taking a trip to Ireland, and needed a hair dryer that could switch voltage. Before we left the US, I changed the switch to be compatible with UK power, followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting (which is just as powerful as the high setting on US voltage), plugged it into the plug adapter (you need this to be able to plug any US appliances into wall outlets in most other countries), plugged that into the wall outlet, and it worked perfectly!  I was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling, but it works so well that I use it every day now!  LOVE it!"
"This dryer is every thing that it says it is! Quiet, professional looking comfortable to use and attractive on the wall. It is certainly a quality item and I would recommend it to anyone"
"This hair dryer is so good that I ordered another one just In case the one I bought 4 years ago dies!, I have not had to use the new one yet, just have it for back up. I can not be without this hair dryer for making my curly hair straight.Use it with ceramic hairbrush (can order together) for sleek straight, non frizzy hair."
It is a great product and has cut down the drying time from 30 mins to 12!
"I love this little hair dryer from Andis.  I have had one for years and it works great, does not take up much room in my suit case when I travel and does not cost much.  I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone."
So far so good!! I've had it a few weeks now and it's still working good. Blowing really hot. Quick dry time.
"I love this hair dryer!  I asked my hairdresser how he achieved such silkiness and shine in my hair, when I, using  the same products at home, couldn't.  He told me the blow dryer is the key.  He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I'm done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.  It is definitely worth the extra care it requires; it dries my hair FAST and leaves it shiny, sealed and beautiful!"
"Small, light in weight & easy to use. It does the job & I love it!"
"I love this hair dryer!  On vacation I used my sisters & was so impressed that once I got home, I went online & ordered it.  This hair dryer is the best I've ever bought, and I've had plenty over the years.  Most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high. This one is very quiet, almost whooshing it dry.  Also, my hair is smoother than it's ever been after being dried. Could it really be the fact it is tourmaline or ceramic?? No matter, I would highly recommend this brand and this model!     Buying it through Amazon made it much easier since I didn't want to go through the hassle of looking for it, not knowing which stores carried this exact model.  Price was very competitive."
"I just love my Conair 1875 Blow Dryer.  It's more powerful than any blow dryer that I've ever purchased.  I have long hair that generally takes 15 minutes to dry with my Revlon 1875.  The Conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  And it's great for travel because it folds in half and is very, very light in weight.  I happily give this dryer 5 stars and would give it 10 if the option was available."
These paints are colorful and really easy to use. They come with the option to paint like normal finger nail polishes OR you can flip them over and use the paint pen. The pen option works well for doing designs and nail art. I would buy some clear polish to help protect the designs though! The product is cute and worth the money.
Dries my hair fast and isn't very loud. Absolutely love it! Thank you so much!
"I have very thick, very curly hair that typically takes a LONG time to dry. The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won't do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good. It's great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time. Highly recommended!"
"Great packaging and quick shipping. I love that the settings are not too hot and the low speed is perfectly low, even for a toddler. The high speed will do when she gets older, I'm sure."
"Looks great, works great, cord isn't too short (a pet peeve), and I love that it has more than 2 settings like many dryers these days. I can even give my dogs a little help drying off in the winter since I can change up the settings the moment it's a bit too hot or cool without going too far the opposite direction. Really liking the product so far. For me, Conair has always delivered."
"Everyone that comes over comments: HERE did you get a hotel hair dryer! I WANT ONE!!!?it works great, I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects. it easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in it holster (like slamming an old telephone haha) very satisfying because it turns OFF when you put it in its home. Love that about it. I also like the position of the grip.<br />I mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips so we didn have to drill holes. It holding up well and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off it mount and work with it directly. Great buy"
I bought it because it's not very expensive and free shipping. It's very good quality and not so so big . Only thing is you can't fold it.
"I needed new hair dryers for upstairs and downstairs bathrooms and didn't want to pay too much. I don't do a lot of styling, mostly just wash and dry, so I didn't need a lot of attachments. This one suited me perfectly. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth.<br />My old dryer was a Conair and worked well for years. I hope this one lasts as long.<br />To anyone looking for a nice simple hair dryer, reasonably priced, I would recommend this one."
"Love love this hair dryer. My first time to own a Turbo Power but should have been buying for years. Live and learn!<br />I have very fine, thin, hair and all my other dryers have been to harsh on my fragile locks with 1875 watts. After researching the best for my hair issues - the lower wattage, 1500,  is perfect and dries my hair beautifully, smooth and shinny. This dryer is also very substantial in motor which is important to me so it will last."
"I have just used it once, but it worked great. Dried my hair in about 15 minutes."
"Nice quality, fairly quiet, nice looking and not too big.  I bought two."
"Bought this as a damaged box item. It was in perfect condition. It is a professional hairdryer so keep in mind it is solid & somewhat heavier than your basic, cheap home brand."
Compact and powerful.
Works really well. My hair is short but it did what I wanted it to do.  Good investment.
Love this dryer.  I specifically chose it because it is not as loud as others.
I bought this hair dryer probably 3 years ago and never got around to posting a review. This hair dryer is fantastic- I have had it for 3 years or so and I have never had a problem or malfunction. It drys my hair fast and reduces frizz. I will always buy Elchim.
Love this hair dryer. It dries my hair faster than others and makes my hair soft.
Good product. Received quickly. As expected.
"Wonderful! Just what I was looking for. I have medium length, thick, wavy hair. It smooths as it dries. Is light weight and quiet. And I love how hot it gets- lets me know its really working!"
This is one powerful hair dryer. The heat can be controlled along with the height and hood position.
Bought this for $20 on Amazon (sale?).  Nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use.  I'm surprised more women don't have hearing loss from all the noise of these things.
I would recommend this product - compact and powerful - worth for money
Amazing.  Very short drying time with no frizz.
Just like my old one.  I love it.
Convenient and classy wall mount hair dryer. No fumbling under the sink or closet. Available when I want it!
"i got this for my mother, her old one is going bad, she was so happy when i got it for her birthday. she's very happy with the product. thank you"
Exactly as expected. Good value.
powerful and adjustable
Light weight yet dries hair fast
Love it so far. No complaints that I've come across
Nice & quiet
Works great!  My 12 year old and 9 year old daughters use it and it's easier for them than using a regular hair dryer.
I luv this product.. it's not only attractive but it does what it said. Makes my hair soft & shinny.
Daughter loves it.  Works just as reviews stated.  Well worth the money.
Good product and delivery was performed as expected
"good product I have nin type of complaint, I am satisfied recommend this seller and product"
"I like this hair dryer, it's worth the price. Thank you"
"Powerful, well-designed and worth the money."
so far ok
"I've used this for a few years now, and it has been flawless so far. I'm hoping it will outlast my need for it."
Powerful and compact.  What I was looking for.
worth the expense
Powerful hair dryer for a travel model
"Love the size, love the color, it even has a slow speed that gives off an appropriate amount of heat."
Great value for low price. It's not too loud and has the power you expect from an 1875 watt dryer.
Compact and powerful.  Just what I was looking for.
Compact and powerful
This is the third time I have bought this model. I love that it mounts on the wall so I don't have it in a drawer or on the counter. The night light is a bonus. Each one lasts about 5 years before the plastic breaks or wears out.
I thought that hair dryers are just that - hair dryers. This is not your standard hair dryer - it can basically style your hair without applying any gel or styling products on your hair. It is that amazing. And it keeps the style of your hair for the rest of the day.
"This is the best travel dryer I have used, and I have bought many. Only negative - it isn't dual voltage so it won't work in countries with 240 volt wiring."
"This is light, quiet, effective, several options for heat and speed settings.  Everything you need. Top rated by consumer reports."
Purchased based on reviews and two features:  folding handle and retracting cord.  Useful in the home and for travel. Performs as advertised and rated.
"I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She had one similar to this for many,many years and needed it replaced. To my surprise she told me she liked this one better than her old one."
We were staying in a hotel in DC. The hotel furnished an Andis dryer with retractable cord. I enjoyed using it so much so I ordered one as soon as we returned home. It came just a few days later. Im very happy with it.
I bought this dryer just because it was my favorite color. It turns out that it also is a wonderful dryer. I love it. Lots of power and quiet. /Quiet enough to use on my puppy who no longer is frightened of being dried after his bath.
Love this dryer.have been using the same kind for several years. Lots of power for straight hair and low is also great for curly hair.
"I'm a professional hairdresser so I need a powerful blow dryer that's light. This serves the purpose it's powerful, light and hat. Six of the seven stylists in our salon use it do I guess there's nothing else to say."
"This hair dryer is compact, folds up, has a retractable cord and is powerful.  My husband loves the sleek design and the compactability."
It's absolutely amazing.  My wife claims she never knew a blow dryer could make such a change in the way you style your hair.  Worth the price.
"I have bought it for my wife, she loved it. She does not has to go work with wet hair anymore :D. I recommend it."
Dryer is tiny and comes with a travel bag including 2 attachments; the handle does not fold. It's a real nice product overall.
"I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this, and I'm glad I listened to them. This is a powerful, easy-to-use dryer. It gets the job done, and while I use styling products, it does help make it somewhat silky smooth. Definitely recommend."
"IF YOU WANT QUALITY FOUNDATION YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I BOUUGHT A PHYSICIAN'S FORMULA FOUNDATION AND WOW, WHAT CRAP THAT WAS, THEIR SPONGE THEY SELL WITH THE COMPACT WON'T EVEN FIT IN THEIR COMPACT.          BUT THIS GABRIEL COMPACT IS GREAT, THE FOUNDATION IS SUPERB."
"This hair dryer is the best I have ever owned. I do not think that it is too heavy, or has a short cord, or too loud.  It all worked out for me. The heat is not as hot as plastic dryers, and I did not have frizz. It held my style in place.  I gave it 5 stars because I am am very pleased with this purchase."
I bought this razor for my Dad who decided to switch to electric shaving at age 97!  It works really great for him: shaves beautifully and is well designed.  You will not be disappointed with this shaver.
My boy does not like when I put any cream on his face. He does not mind Mustela Dermo-pediatrics stelaprotect. Skin is so smooth and smells lovely. I can only recommend it!
We were concerned to begin with because of a post about weight but found that this was in fact the perfect size for us. It seems to be well built. Our issue with a different brand had been that the cord would break where the cord met the handle and it seems as though this one the cord is a little more protected. We will see how it holds up over time but as of right now I'm very hopeful.
"I absolutely love this dryer! The buttons are easy to use, the concentrator nozzle keeps my hair smooth and it dries in half the time! I would buy this again!"
Like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room. Has a nice quiet sound and drys my hair very nicely.  Also the retractable cord it great so you don't have alot of cord that you have to wind up. This item also works well in a small drawer if being used at home.
"I travel for work a lot and many of the hotels where I stay provide the Andis Ionic ceramic hair dryer in the rooms.  Really like the results so I decided to order one for home.  Light weight, not too loud and easy on the hair.  For the price, I highly recommend this dryer."
"fast, lightweight and durable.   This is the BEST hair dyer ever.   Not only does my hair dry in half the time it also looks shinny and healthy.   I love this hairdryer!"
I love it.  Works very well and plenty of air velocity to dry anyones hair.  Highly recomended for anyone whio needs a good hair dryer.
"I bought this as a replacement for my daughter's old compact hairdryer.  I haven't used it myself; but based on what she said--it is small, light, cute, not obnoxiously loud, doesn't get too hot, and doesn't suck her hair into the intake (like her old one did.) The first day she used it, she came downstairs and said, Either I'm having a fabulously lucky hair day, or this hairdryer is as awesome as it's supposed to be!  We are pleased with the purchase and would buy this item again."
"I love it! It's not as strong as I expected, but my hair dries super fast."
"This hairdryer is perfect. No more hunting for the hairdryer, it's right there on the wall, just like in a hotel bathroom. I've only had it for a month but so far I am very pleased."
"This wall mounted hair dryer is so nice... I also have the Sunbeam 1500 but I prefer this one.  It easily comes off the cradle, it is fairly quiet (compared to the Sunbeam) and the design is just more user-friendly.  Spend the extra few bucks on this one!  It's a great product."
"Love it.  I ordered two.  Works great, small, lightweight, easy to handle.  Like the long cord and the cool shot button."
"I bought this because I could not use my Conair Infiniti pro hot brush when I travel to other country. Fortunately, this performs much better than the conair hot brush. Aside from providing me a good styled-hair, my hair also shines better after using this. This product is very durable, it shows on the design. I've been using this regularly for three months now."
"This dryer is perfect for travel.  It is not tiny, like some travel dryers, but is smaller than the normal hair dryer.  The pullout cord is extra long, the handle folds for packing, it is powerful, AND uses the ionic technology.  It is perfect for me.  I love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop.  Excellent product!"
"When we got this hair dryer we wanted one that wouldn't cause fly away hair. This certainly lives up to the claims. Also this dryer has individual controls for speed and heat. I really like that, because most of the time I don't need high heat but do want more blowing power. It also isn't very noisy as far as hair dryers go."
I was happy to buy another Elchim dryer.  My first one died after about five years of using it regularly.  I used my T2000 as a spare until I found a good deal on a new Elchim.  Elchim is far better than the T2000.  I have mid to long blond (colored) hair and it dries my colored hair quickly and smoothly.  My hair color covers gray hair which is wirey and dry.  This dryer gives me the look I want for my hair -- long and smooth.  Amazon had the best price on it.  The price was comparable to what my stylist would have paid at a beauty supply store.
"I love this dryer because it is so gentle with only two settings. The band on the bonnet is tight at first, but after weekly or biweekly use it gets a bit more comfortable. I cover my ears with Wrapp-it bands when drying. The carrying case is convenient and everything fits perfectly inside even after several uses."
wow. she is awesome woman say that it doesn't take long to dry there hair. I need to order one more for my daughter.
"I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself and I wanted to encourage her independence. This is so small and light. She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence. It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories."
Can't help but to brag about this to everyone. This hair dryer works so good and dries hair super fast. It is heavy though so don't drop it on your toe like I did! Love all the settings it has.
"This is a great hairdryer. Very pleased, even if it is a slight pink."
Works great ! it's strong and small enough for travelling
Works great! Dries my hair with no problem and my hair isn't as frizzy as it usually is when I blow dry it. Haven't had any problems with it after the month I've had it. :)
"This helps us from having STUFF all on the top of our bathroom countertop, since we have limited counter top in this Bathroom. We had one before that hung on the wall of the bathroom, our motorhome.  Great for organization & small places."
The wall mount dryer was just what I needed for my new small bathroom as I do not have any counter space.  Works great!
"Love it!  Works fabulous, not too hot and does everything it says it will.  I'm no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter but it works great for us ... also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord ROCKS!"
"A long time Elchim user here- didn't think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow. Well- this is better than that! Fastest drying time ever, heat is right on. It is a little heavy, which frankly- none of the GOOD dryers are light, so you can't really ding it on that. I have hair to below my shoulder blades, wavy/frizzy, colored- and this makes it ALMOST to the point of no flat iron. Worth the price, just the best dryer ever!"
"Great & great color,very string. It's my 2nd one. Second because I lost 1st one due to my house burning."
"This is my second Andis hair dryer.  I had the first one over six years but it was starting to wear out.  I wanted to stay with this brand and this one is even better.  Lightweight and easy to hold.  I like the three heat settings which the older one did not have.  More important, styling is better and my hair really does feel silkier and looks shinier.  I recommend this product."
"I've only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer but I love it.  The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair. The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  It's a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  Great product at a good price."
I have very curly and voluminous hair and this dryer was my best investment. I usually dry my hair on high/cold and it takes less than 10 minutes which saves me time and energy. I also use the dryer when i want to straighten my hair and it's amazing and dries my hair in rollers really fast.
A couple months in and so far so go.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Light and comfortable<br />- Nice attachments<br />- No burning smells<br />- Powerful enough<br />- Long Cable<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Not very portable<br /><br />The lightness can make it feel kind of cheap but I would rather it be light than unwieldy<br />-
dry hair very fast! I love it!
Pretty good hair dryer my dad inlaw sometimes  uses it to dry his clothes if that means anything and it hasn't burnt out yet.
I was so tired of cheap hair dryers breaking and decided to purchase this dryer. I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly. I would recommend!
"After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  I had been interested in the 'ions' I'd seen on many packages.  This is a very nice hair dryer, it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well, as designed.  It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  Supposedly, you can remove that part for cleaning, but I haven't figured out how.<br /><br />Overall, a really awesome product, especially for the price."
"After years with my old hairdryer, I found that the new, cheaper ones were just that, cheap.  This is great hairdryer.  It actually makes my hair look better -- gives my short hair more body.  It is very quiet -- my dogs don't run out of the bathroom!  Works great and feels like it should last..."
"LOVE this hairdyer!!  Dries my hair in half the time, is so quiet and light in weight.  My girlfriend has owned this dryer for years and always has it with her when we travel together.  After our last vacation together I decided it was time I owned my own!"
"It arrived within 2-3 days and works perfectly. I have thick, frizzy, curly hair and never have been able to blow dry it because it gets so much poofier. However, with the diffuser this blow dryer made my curls shiny and soft, no frizz or poof, I'm in love!"
"Solidly built hair dryer - diffuser stays on and doesn't pop off on a moment's notice as did a Revlon drier I used to have but which fell apart in less than a year... (am returing to Bed Bath Beyond) nice built in hook for hanging, plenty powerful, not too noisy, price was OK. All in all, works better than a towell and/or shaking the head a lot to remove water!  haha"
This flat iron is hands down the BEST I have ever owned.  Works fantastic and gets my hair pin straight !
"I love the blowdryer, the only thing is the color was not what you see in the picture, it was a shade of a greenish gold color. other than that it's great."
"I needed a dryer with a very long cord and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Light weight, powerful and easy to use."
"I really like this product.  It's compact, but powerful, and pretty lightweight.  Does a good job drying my fine hair (I've fine hair, but a lot of it) in scant minutes.  The only thing it isn't, is quiet, but they don't advertise it as such- just pointing it out though.  I'm very pleased with it."
Super light and easy to handle.  Dries fast and isn't too loud.  A+++++
"Excellent purchase. If your hairs are wet and messy, the dryer makes them quick and easy to manage."
I love the distribution of heat it gives. So much better than the bonnet I bought from sally's that you attach to your hand held blow dryer than seemed to push heat to only one main spot. This was worth the investment.
"Very nice  color and design.especially with very very low noises,so that you can use it in the early morning.will recommend friends to have it."
I not always that I would find a blow dryer for this price and it gets as hot as this one. It does wonders with my daughters very natural hair. I love it and would recommend it to everyone.
"I really like this Conair hairdryer.  I've had it for several months and use it most every day.  It's easy to use, dries my hair quickly and I like that I can set the temperature and speed separately and that the cord retracts."
"I blow-dry my hair almost everyday-and it used to be a chore. This hair dryer has made the process time go by SO quickly, leaves my hair smooth, AND is affordable.  If you're thinking of investing in an amazing hair dryer, invest in this one. It's half the price and totally worth it."
"I tried this hair dryer at a hotel and loved the fact that it was lightweight yet powerful.  I have problems with my arms and this allowed me to dry my hair without the added weight of those other hair dryers.  I loved it so much, I bought 2!"
I spent a very long time waiting for the right deal on an ionic hair dryer and this was the first time in at least 6 months that I saw what I was looking for with an appealing price tag. I took the plunge and bought it and have been VERY happy with the results. My hair turns out very smooth and is even shiny after I use it. The clip on accessory is amazing for focusing the air stream and definitely helps with minimizing frizz. It is also very pretty. :)
"Great for travel, although a tad heavy, but works like a full size dryer.  I like the retractable cord, but it does take a bit of getting used to.  If you pull away when you are drying your hair, it will partly retract, but it just takes getting used to your surroundings and pulling it out far enough to start with.  No big deal.  I am very impressed with this dryer."
"My husband has been using a hair dryer with broken teeth off the comb for what seems like forever.  When he mentioned it, I immediately went to Amazon, found just the right hair dryer and it works perfectly.  It has just the right heat and accessories for both of us.  I would suggest to others to buy this  one."
"Excellent purchase. Materials are a little bit cheap, but it seems pretty solid in case it drops."
Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a solid and well priced hair dryer.
"Drying my hair has never required much time since I live in an arid climate, yet this dryer seems to dry my hair more quickly & to increase the volume.  Very pleased with this product."
Worked great in Germany and the UK.  Just turn the butyon and you are ready for overseas.  Lightweight.  Low setying is powerful.  Highly recommend.
"Love, love, love this hair dryer!  I've been looking (and trying) for months now! I finally found the perfect one for me!  YEAH! It's lightweight, small enough to travel and powerful. So easy to use. Economical, too!  I'm going to buy another one for the guest bath!  It's hard to locate great hair dryers when you find one that you like in a hotel. For some reason Conair puts &#34;1875&#34; on most ALL their dryers, so it's hard to tell the actual model number when you find one that you like...  Glad we were finally able to track this one down!"
This is a great dryer!  I have been using it almost daily for a little over a year now and it is still like new.  It is easy to clean the intake screen and the cord and housing still look like new!  I have dropped this dryer several times with no problems what so every.  A great dryer for the whole family.
I used one of these in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so much I came home and ordered one.  It works so much faster than my older one.
"cord disappears, this one is just fine.  My sister was visiting and said &#34;That's the shortest hair dryer cord I've ever seen.&#34; until I showed her how it retracks and pulls out at will.  Decent hairdryer/decent price."
"Was looking for a small, lightweight hair dryer and this fits the bill perfectly.  Easy to handle and store and enough power to get the job done.  Very pleased and satisfied with this purchase!"
"I have been using this model for the last 10 years, it only been replaced for once.  It is beautiful, space save, powerful and very durable plus it has a night light."
"like it, very durable. it won't dry your hair really quickly but that is good for your hair."
Dries hair quickly without getting too hot.
It dray my hair so quickly. Blow hot air.
Exactly as described and quick delivery.
"I purchased this hair dryer as a Christmas present and she loves it. The dryer warms instantly, looks great (the matte black....although the pink accent isn't my color), does a great job, and even has little rubber spots on the side, so that it doesn't slip (nice touch). It also has a removable filter that can be cleaned. For the price, I can't complain. I would definitely recommend this to others, as it does a great job at a reasonable price."
"Well, I had a Turbo 1500 for a long time until it died. Then I made my research and found this new and powerful version of Twin Turbo 3500. So, I wanted ti invest in something good. I do my own hair at home, and my hair is curly. I finished to dry my hair so fast. I just  love this Twin Turbo 3500 and it worth the $$$."
"This hairdryer works great and is at a great price point. I don't have any complaints on it, but will warn people that the cord is a little shorter than usual."
Although Ferrari is a car's brand it's been known for some decades specially because of the design it's cars offer and now they applied it to the hairdrier.<br /><br />It's said to have a professional quality and it DOES. The item works amazingly well and looks very beautiful so as you'll when using it.<br /><br />The hook on its base makes it easy to keep the cable together after the use. The unit is very compact and travel is quite easy as well.
Love the light weight and ease to hold.  Big dryers are too heavy for me.  Good strong blow power and fast drying
"I bought this for my mom, who has had issues with blow dryers melting her fine-textured hair. She loves this one! It dries her hair very fast and doesn't melt your hair like other blow dryers can. The retractable cord is very nice as well and the dryer doesn't feel cheap. If you're in the market for a new dryer, give this one a try."
"This is the second one I've purchased.  The first just wore out.  Need to be careful to make sure the tubing is not crunched up, but otherwise have had no problem with it.  Works great."
This is my second Twin Turbo and I truly love it.  It is pricey compared to retail dryers but its performance is outstanding. It gives my hair volume and never over dries.  I highly recommend this product.
"I wanted a hair dryer that would work both in the US and when traveling abroad. This dryer functioned well in Europe and everyone borrowed it. It is small, comes with it's own zipper storage bag and is very light weight."
"I've been using this hair dryer for over a year and I still love it.  The cord reel is my favorite feature.  It also has high, medium, and low heat seatings and 2 speeds."
"I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I'd had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear. I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer. I'd taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well. This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I'd liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!"
"I purchased this Conair Hair Dryer several months ago. I have been very pleased with my purchase. My previous hair dryer was also a Conair and I had used it for several years. There are a few improvements on the new dryer that the old one didn't have, and I am very happy to have them because they were things I didn't like about the old dryer. This dryer has a &#34;Cool&#34; button, a feature I haven't had before and I wasn't sure if I even needed it. It does come in handy when finishing styling, holding your style in place.There are two attachments; a flow director and a defuser. These attachments easily snap into place and are easy to remove, unlike the old attachments which were a struggle to get on and off. This dryer fulfills all my needs. Thanks for the improvements Conair. The dryer shipped quickly and was in good shape when delivered. Fulfilled as promised by Amazon."
"This is a GREAT product. I have long, thick, curly, red hair, and it works wonders. Sometimes I want straight hair, so I'll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair, and it works great! This hair dryer dries my hair in 10 min flat, sometimes in 5 minutes depending on the day. I also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself. So awesome and convenient!! You must buy this hair dryer, it will change your life! :)"
"Great hair dryer, nicely balanced, good air flow, and not too loud. This is one appliance I hate having to replace, as you get so accustomed to one, but this one is if anything an improvement over my old favorite. Dual heat & speed controls are a must for me. Nice inclusion of the extra drying attachments."
Dries quickly without &#34;drying out&#34; my hair. Easy to handle and not heavy.
It's dries your hair quickly and it's not too loud.  This is the second one that I've bought.  The first one lasted about 6 years and then the cord wore out and was exposing bare wires but the motor never wore out.  Great product!
"I have had the same Vidal Sassoon dryer for years.  Someone big stepped on the plug which made it unsafe to use.  I love this dryer, it's exactly what I've been using! I'm totally satisfied with the purchase....thanks for the quick delivery!"
"For some time now I've been searching for a more quiet hair dryer and I have finally found it!! I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep! At 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet.<br /><br />I also love the Ionic technology. My husband & I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I've tried it I'm a believer! With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily. With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft! It's also helping with my split ends.<br /><br />The 3 heat seatings are great too! I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62F and the hottest is approximately 223F. It gets really hot, but it's great that you can use the cool shot feature to &#34;set&#34; you style when done.<br /><br />Bottomline: quietest dryer I've ever used and totally worth the money too!"
I got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently and it is still working great. I love the way the cord retracts and how the unit folds. It is great for travel but I use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend's house since it works so well. My hair is long and thick and this thing still gets the job done just as well as my full-sized hair dryer that I keep at home.
"This is the best Flat Iron Period!!!    I have used T3 over $200, GHD nearly $300, They work, but for $39.99 the best I have ever used.  Buy this one don't waste your money on the other brands."
as expected! good
This dryer is amazing I have 3c/4a hair and it dried and straightened my hair in mins wow! Love it!
Great! Everything I expected from Conair. MORE than enough heat for my thick curly hair. Love it!
"small, light, powerful, good amount of heat."
Very convenient and portable. This dryer has the perfect temperature settings and is long lasting.
great small hair dryer that I'm able to keep in the camper for when we travel about. takes up nearly zero space & works quite well
My elchim hair dryer is a very powerful product that helps me style my hair with ease. It has many settings and temperatures. I highly recommend this item to laymen and professional stylists.
"excellent for thick long hair , it just take me 15 min to dryhair , my hair now shiny and looks more stylist"
"This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons. It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   you would experience in a salon. Heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there. Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn't seem to be any type of safety issue. This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair. I use them for my dreadlocks and it works great!!"
"I stayed at a Lowe's hotel in LA last year and they had this hairdryer in the hotel room and feel in love with it.  I liked it's compact, lightweight feel and it comes with a diffuser that I keep on all the time.  I find it dries my hair quickly and it was relatively inexpensive for the $19 I paid for it."
"I've had it for over 2 months and love it so far!  I have no problems with the nozzle falling off, it blows my hair dry in 1/2 the time it took before, and my hair feels so much softer!  I love it!"
It makes my hair straight. I love it. The smaller nozzel focuses the heat where i want it. Strong and powerful.
This dryer is not quiet but the noise is so much more tolerable compared to some dryers that has whistling noise or just super loud.  I love that it is foldable and retractable - makes it easier for storage and for traveling.
"Very nice hair dryer. My favorite thing is that you push down the on/off button and heat controls, you don't SLIDE it as with my last dryer. Important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands etc....works well, looks good, nice controls. I am happy with it. I don't think it works any differently than my last Ionic hair dryer, in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair, but it works equally well at a minimum."
Handy/powerful little blower that I keep around strictly for any guests that might be staying the night.  Perfect that it folds as it maybe gets used once a month.  No problem with the retractable cord yet but I could see that easily getting jammed at some point
"I have thick hair that is cut into a bob. This is exactly what I was looking for in a dryer. It has high and low settings and it also has 1400 and 1600 adjustable settings. I chose to keep mine on 1400 and it dries my hair in minutes. It is also perfect for styling my hair as i do the final drying. I love the convenience of having it mounted on the wall out of the way. It does have a nice night light that is bright, but I count that as a plus for early morning trips to the bathroom when you aren't ready for a regular light."
"Just received it; yesterday; delivered on time, no problem.  It's so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser & concentrator. But it works as well as a larger hairdryer, certainly far, far better than a hotel wall dryer, and better than some full-sized ones, too. And it is extremely light, not tiring on the arms. The diffuser successfully brought out waves in my hair; the concentrator straightened my bangs.  I bought it to fit in my carry-on luggage, which it does nicely. What's not to like?"
"This hair dryer is great because of a few key features: 1- the retractable cord. ok ok not so special. 2- it has 3 heat settings, 3 levels of blowing and a cooling button for this price thats unheard of. Its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too. Not loving the neon barbie pink but hey its a great dryer for cheap. And its got some nice attachments too like a huge SERIOUS diffuser !"
"We purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in Hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness. Our experience is the same. On the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we've tried before. It has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters. I have been able to eliminate hairspray as I style the hair with the dryer and a comb. There must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. It costs more than most dryers but the product quality, the quietness on the low setting, the long cord, the most important item, the way my hair looks makes the price worth it."
"very good dryer, nice power, not as heavy as the reviews I read previously."
"Awesome dryer! Handles well, dries the hair fast, very easy to control. The only negative...its a little heavy. Love it and would recommend it to all!"
"I was looking to replace my hair dryer but didn't want to spend over a hundred dollars for it.  I checked with Amazon and the Onei MK-II hair dryer was featured for less than half that price.  I figured if it wasn't that good I would keep it as a back up.  I am happy to report that this is a wonderful hair dryer. It works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers. My hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry but this hair dryer does it faster.  I use this hair dryer every day and will order another for my beach house.  Another good quality is that for a full-size hair dryer, it is lighter than most."
Just the right size and power for travel.
Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.
does the job right
This hair dryer is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />Great product in a compact size and a low price that doesn't reflect the product - it works as good as any large expensive hair dryer.<br /><br />Great for home use and packs in a suitcase for travel nicely.
"Love this.  I dropped my previous one, different brand, and had to replace it.  The cord-keeper part is the main feature for me.  The hair dryer itself works fine, a little louder than most but is also more lightweight than most.  Love it!"
"Fast, smooth and easy!  The wall mount saves time in the daily routine of drying hair.  I should buy one for each bathroom!"
I received this blow dryer fast. My other Conair broke after many years. This new one works great & my hair dries fast.
"This is an awesome hair dryer - I never really thought there was much difference between the various kinds until now! My hair, which is thick, drys super quick and this dryer eliminates all the frizz - amazing :)"
I had one like this for about 8 years. Even though it still works I figured I should retire it as an extra or back up. I searched everywhere and bought several new hair dryers but none compare to my old one. I googled the serial number of my old one and with awesome luck I found the exact same hair dryer that I loved for all those years. Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery and the great product.
Great dryer. It is very powerful and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.
"I was actually wearing this color when I had my daughter (who is now 2), so I have an emotional connection.  Honestly though, it is a great color.  If you are familiar with OPI you know it is a quality product.  The color is very girly without reminding you of little girls.  It has the maturity behind it I guess you would say!  I love love love it and I was so glad to find it as it is discontinued!"
This was a great dryer while it lasted.  I loved all the different settings because I could use it on my small dod with no problems.  It did dry hair faster.  After 2 years the electric safety plug blew and the hairdryer is bricked.<br /><br />I just bought another cheaper Andis and see it has a 5 year warranty.  If this one had a 5 year warranty too I wish someone had said or posted something or wish I saw it if it was listed on the box if it was offered.  If you notice this ad makes no mention of warranty.<br /><br />This was a good but heavy dryer while it lasted.  2 lbs I think.  I liked the range in heat and speed of airflow much better than what I replaced this with.  The variety in heat and speed worked out perfect for the dog and me.  My dog preferred the low warm or hot while I preferred fast and hot.  The weight of the dryer didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />Did I gyp myself out of warranty on this dryer?  I sure hope not because I already threw it away  :(
"Great dryer. Dries quickly, love the different temperature settings. It is a little heavier than I expected, but so far, so good!"
"Its a great hairdryer. Its much less noisy than some of the  others. It motivated me to go out and purchase another blow dryer to replace the cheap Walmart brand that I had bought before. It seems to do a good job drying my hair even though, its hard to tell because I do not have very much hair"
Powerful and small. Like the compact convenience of it and am happy this dryer doesn't take over my drawer space.
"My old Conair burnt out after about 10 years of use. I debated spending more money on a pricier model, but saw the reviews for more costly hair dryers were hit or total miss. I decided on this dryer, it came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser. I've used both and I love this dryer. It gets the job done. I just wish that the cord was retractable (like my old Conair dryer)."
"Light, compact and dries my hair really fast. That's exactly what I needed for day to day use and for travel."
"This hair dryer functions really well. It is strong and hot enough, and it can also be cool. It is pretty light and doesn't vibrate in hand. I recommend it!"
It is powerful and easy to use.  Dry the hair in 2-3 minutes (my hair is about 2 inches long).  Great product.
"Don't be fooled by its tiny size...it is so powerful! It dries my hair as fast and my big one! It's cute, convenient and efficient. I love it!"
"At present, I am using this hair dryer at home.  I like it so much that I am going to buy another one for my travel bag. When I visit family and friends I like to bring my own hair dryer so I keep one packed in my suitcase.<br />This hair dryer is light and powerful.  My hair looks better than it did when I used my previous dryer-shinier and easy to manage."
My daughter uses it regularly. It does a good job drying and is easy to use. She actually sets up her art table and works while drying her hair!
Excellent hair dryer. I love it because I can get very high heat on a low or high blow setting. Also it cools down quickly on the cool air setting to lock in styles. Just enough blow power and plenty of choices for temp and speed. Easy to handle.
Great ; little dryer for Africa!
"Works great! It's so cute! Wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color. It does the job! I have fine hair and this dryer doesn't overpower me or my hair. Nice and lightweight. You might think, oh, this little thing isn't going to do anything, but it DOES! Highly recommended for fine hair."
"wow!!! incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale. I ordered it on Thursday..it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia). put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up! So easy to assemble!! Can't wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!! will update again after more use.<br /><br />Update: This dryer is fantastic!! Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes! on medium heat!! I did not need neck covers or ear protectors at all. I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood. It's also very quiet--I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television. I haven't had to duct tape anything, it's pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I'm not moving around a lot if I'm sitting under the dryer anyway..<br /><br />Basically, I love it and I'm SO GLAD i didn't waste my money on a Pibb or PEBCO brand. I don't own a salon, but it's great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer."
I've only had the product a short time and purchased it to install in my guest bathroom.  I had a guest visiting from England for three weeks and she loved it! She said it was better than most she has encountered in 1st class hotels.  I'm surprised how quiet it is.
"I had first seen/used this hairdryer at a Hampton Inn and was impressed with how well it performed: quiet, powerful, and solid.  Not too heavy, with a grippy handle.  So...I bought one for myself and love it!"
"I haven't had a dryer with attachments since high school, but this thing is a life saver! I don't have to straighten my hair when I use the small tooth comb and it dries my hair very fast. So much of my time has been saved since I got this wonderful gadget."
"Nice hair dryer, mounted on the wall, clearing counter space and easily acceptable.  Varied during speed....great little hairdryer."
"This hair dryer is awesome, The price is great and it has serious power on the top settings, you have to be careful not to burn your face, i have short hair and my whole head is dry in under a min on the max settings. Looks good and feels nice in your hands, not to heavy. My girlfriend loves it"
Awesome dryer! It's fast and efficient with less noise than my old Conair dryer! Fast shipping was a plus!
"Haven't had a new hair dryer in many years and I just love this one.  It's light enough for me to handle and yet strong enough to do the job.  Thank you, Conair."
I thought I may of overpaid for just a hair dryer - but this product works very well.  It is effecient & drys hair quickly and makes my hair shine!  Friends & family that use it also notice a positive difference.
"Petit, cute, powerful! Better than the one I use usually at home"
"This is my second Conair Ionic hairdryer. This was exactly what I wanted and was not disappointed. Love the retractable cord, the folding handle and the 120/220 option for traveling."
"The dual wattage feature saves you from having to use a converter. The unit is very small yet plenty powerful, and way better than the dryers provided in hotels. For my hairstyle, the air concentrator attachment is a must. I'm very pleased with this dryer."
"Make your hair soft, frizz free. My daughter has very thick fine hair. It does a wonderful job. Highly recommend."
"This midsize but powerful dryer is a game changer. I LOVE it! I have layered, waist length hair that becomes a frizz mess if not blow dried properly. The Volare V2 dries my hair smooth and silky. I've been using Sedu 6000 which blows too strong and gets really hot surges that smokes my hair. V2 has the perfect combination of heat and airflow, and the cool temp actually blows cool air. My hair dries and styles faster with the V2 than the Sedu. Made in Italy. Four year warranty. My search for the perfect dryer is over."
"This is the best blow dryer I have brought it works amazingly on my hair and my daughters hair. I have tried other blowers but they would always leave my hair fizzy and dull. But this blower leaves my hair soft, manageable and frizz free."
I purchased this hair dryer after it was recommended by a friend.  I absolutely love it!  I have long hair and have never been able to dry my hair as quickly as I can with this hair dryer.  I can't say enough good things about it and highly recommend it to anyone!
Great little Hair Dryer!! It quickly dries even a lot of Hair.
"I am so happy this hair dryer is light, well-functioned and totally enough for daily use and travel. Highly recommend this product!"
"Used this hair dryer at a hotel and had to have one!  It's light weight, retract cord and high powered."
"I've only used this a few times so far, but I really love it.  I've had difficulty finding a dryer that 1) doesn't fry curly hair, 2) isn't too heavy when drying the back of my head, 3) doesn't sound like a jet taking off, 4)has a diffuser, and 4) has separate heat and power settings - with the warm actually warm, not hot.<br /><br />This dryer does all that - I'm a very happy camper!"
"I purchased this to replace my old Conair folding handle dryer. That one was a bit more compact, which I liked, but this one isn't bulky and works really well. I appreciate the ability to control both the temperature and speed of the air. I would definitely recommend it."
I really love this hair dryer. My hair always looks nice and smooth and silky after using it and it dries my thick hair really fast.
This was exactly as advertised; I especially liked the dimensions given. Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to switch the lever behind the lint filter to get full power.
This blow dryer is lightweight and powerful.  I have thick Keratin relaxed hair and it tames my hair beautifully.  It gets very hot - which I need - and the airflow is strong.  There is a cool shot that helps with sealing in a curl or wave.  I would definitely recommend this product.
"Great way to save counter space, well constucted hair dryer, high speed is fast and hot, makes for a quick dry."
Love this hairdryer! I've had maybe 5 or 6 of them. Mostly they only die when I drop them on the floor. I love the fact that the new one fits the wall mount from the last one and I didn't have to make new holes in my wallpaper! It's a great little hairdryer and not expensive.
Wind is strong and does not feel too hot. Get hairs dry quickly. Love this product.
I have 4a/b natural hair and I don't like to use direct heat (blow dryer/flat iron) on it very often. I ordered the dryer because I often don't have the time to wait around for my hair to air dry after washing/conditioning and styling. This dryer is great. It was easy to assemble and seems to be durable. The tempature and timer settings work well. It get's the job done!
"I like this item very much, easy to take and easy to control, that's exactly what I want to use in my daily life"
"I ordered this hair dryer on Friday, and received it on Monday! Extremely fast shipper. And the hairdryer works amazing. The air heats up extremely quickly, and it dried my hair so fast without damaging it. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with how awesome this hair dryer is for the price!!!"
"I have used this product before and it is so great that I bought it for gifts. Don't let the price scare you off it is worth every dollar. Your hair will dry in half the time of other dryers but most important it will not damage your hair like most other  dryers. Your hair will stay healthy and will shine.Found the best price on Amazon, it was half the price I found elsewhere."
"I bought this hair dryer because I liked that it came with the attachments and that it was reasonably priced. What I found was in addition to the attachments, this hair dryer is very powerful! I recently had to use my old dryer and kept looking at it to make sure I had it on high, then was looking to see if there was dust blocking the way! What a huge difference.<br />I highly recommend this dryer. My only complaint would be the buttons on the handle are not in a great place. I had to get used to holding the dryer and not turning it off by accident. I still give it five stars though!"
"Love it Love it Love.  I almost dropped $200 bucks on a blow dryer from the Dry Bar, but opted to save some $ instead when my hair dresser told me about this one.  I love the temp functions and it really does the job without totally damaging my hair!  Also, I seem to be able to blow dry my hair faster since the end of the blow dryer is smaller and air is really more concentrated."
"Used this dryer in hotel and liked it so much that I searched online and found it at great price on Amazon.  Dryer is compact, dries hair fast and heat setting is not too hot.  You have option of mounting on wall bracket or not.  I use as home dryer and also take with me for travel.  Great little dryer and prefer over many other name brand hair dryers I have purchased in the past."
I bought the Conair Blackbird to replace a similar older model that I had for many years.  I know that there a lot of new-tech hair dryers out there. For my needs; I didn't need the new technology.  I wanted to replace my old Conair with a powerful and modern version of the original.  I'm very pleased with the Blackbird.  I'm a male and only blow dry my hair a couple of times a week.  I don't have to use the hottest setting and get great results at a lesser heat level.  The higher heat settings would be perfect for a woman with long hair.  This hair dryer is very powerful and I do a lot of styling on the cool setings as well.          This is the first time I've reviewed a product...I'm so pleased with the Blackbird that I wanted to share.  Starlight
I love this blow dryer...it gets my hair dried fast and has different temperature settings and even a cool blast button.  For those going natural this is a great choice!!
"Love the aroma of this little stick of perfume.  So clean, a touch of lemon and easy to carry anywhere."
"Powerful hairdryer.  It doesn't have a cool setting, so if that is a concern check out the other Andis dryers.  LOVE the bright night light, it is a soft white!"
"Multiple settings, light, and easy to use"
Works great to dry my daughters natural hair.
"This hair dryer is amazing, it cuts my hair drying time to half, with smooth shining hair as result. Shipping was from Japan, took about 10 days to arrive in US with registered mail."
Good power. Light weight. Nice long cord. Only drawback is cool shot button is sensitive and in awkward place. Otherwise great dryer!!
LOVE IT LEFT MY HAIR SOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL LIKE IN THE SALON<br />DOES NOT OVER HEAT<br />AND ITS SMALL LIGHTWEIGH POWERFUL BUT DONT LET THE SIZE AND WEIGHT MISGUIDE YOU ITS A POWERFUL THING LIKE A PLANE OR CAR OR BOAT....LOVE IT. I USE IT ON MY HAIR ON M MOMS HAIR ON MY COUSINS HAIR AND ON MY SISTERS HAIR AND ON MY 2 DOGS HAIR I WOULD USE IT ON MY DADS HAIR BUT HES BALD LOL LOVE IT.... GET IT ASAP YOU CANT GO WRONG
I have owned this dryer previously and was looking to acquire a replacement but had wanted to shop this out sinceit is pricey for a hair dryer.  Phenomenal price and even better delivery time.
I have previously owed one of these and I really like the convenience of the wall mount. heat and air are great
Works great.  I have thick hair and it dries really quickly with this hair dryer.
Wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer.  Has been using for over 2 years and still going strong.  Well worth the money.
"This is the only perfume that I love.  Luckily, even though it's off the market for years, Amazon is still selling the inventory."
Amazing amount of air that comes out of it! My wife and I love it... My waiting time to go out is cut in more than half!! Highly recommended. Feels solid like you are getting your money's worth. Has a nice long cord too..
"I never ever write reviews for products, but with this I had to!! It's that amazing. My hair is very thick, and blowdrying my hair with this dryer is faster and easier than I ever could have imagined. You know that amazing feeling you get when you've just gone to a salon? That's what your hair is like every time you use this dryer. 100% worth the money."
Love it.. small hands and it is very good and lasts a long time.
Blow drying my hair is by far my least favorite activity everyday so I like to get a powerful blow dryer that can help speed up the process... this one is great! I strongly suggest to anyone looking for one with power!
"My first Yellow Bird lasted over 7 years and plenty of use by myself and friends. The best dryer ever. This new one works just as well, though I don't think I'll loan this one out so it might last longer."
"Have had it for 8 months, works great. Don't know how it does it, but it dries my hair 3 times faster and with less heat than my old hairdryer. Not disappointed."
"this hair dryer was worth the money. The quality is good without breaking the wallet. Also, the size is optimal, very small, easy to handle and operate."
"This is just what a hair dryer should be. Out of the way when not in use, easy and powerful. I just bought three more, one for work (I am a barber) one for my other bathroom and a spare."
"I have achieved healthy-looking non-frizzy hair by rubbing this oil over my hands and cuticles, and then running my hands through my hair. A little of this stuff goes a long way. I also love that this product has no fragrance- it is practically odorless, which makes it ok to use around my chemically sensitive mother. Its a great product. Would buy it again."
"This is the second one I bought... because my daughter stole my first one!!! The ease to travel with it is amazing, but I use it every single day!! I love that it dries so fast and is so light weight!!! None of the clunky other driers would ever do now!! I am spoiled!"
I'm  in love with this hair dryer It's small but really dry's my hair fast and does a wonderful job.
"long cord that easily retracts without whipping into things or your face. Perfect for travel, although slightly bigger than some of the mini blowdryers it stays compact because of the retractably cord and folding handle, and you get all the power of a standard blow dryer and ionic technology"
"Conair is a great brand for hair dryers. My previous one was still going after 8 years but figured it was just time for an upgrade! This hair dryer is GREAT: heats up quickly, dries hair fast and really does have a comfortable grip. The cool air button gets cold fast too, and it's not very loud, even on high. Great quality product for the price!"
Great Product for the price. Very light  and powerful. You don't have to spend a lot of money for a good hair dryer. You won't be disappointed!
I love this hair dryer!  It dries my hair in half the time and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  I can't believe the great price - I had been looking at it in a local store for $250!!  Glad I didn't spring for that!  It is also much quieter than other hair dryers.  Don't hesitate to buy this - you won't regret it.
"I have always loved Conair products and used them for years. I had an old Conair hair dryer since early 2000's and it finally took a dive. What I loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was. I searched on Amazon for the same and/or similar style and came across this. The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you're using it. I have very long and thick hair and this gets the job done! If you're the type of person who doesn't want sore arms when drying your hair, this is perfect for you!"
"I'm a big fan of Panasonic hair Dryers and the reason why is simply because they leave my hair looking healthy and shiny .<br />fair price and does a great job keeping my hair straight with a bounce and weight in it , I blow dry my hair then use the KURUKURU after I spray my hair with a heat protector .. P.S ( My Hair type is wavy ) :-)"
Very nice. I love the different heat settings and the noise level is really low compared to my old Conair hair dryer
"this hair dryer does wonders on naturally wavy, thick hair.  it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth.  the three heat settings are amazing too :)  and i can't even say how much i love the retractable cord feature... no more trying to make my cord wrap around my dryer to keep it out of the way.  great product."
"It is exactly what I needed! It dries and smooths my long, wavy, curly hair. Also very easy to handle."
Powerful yet compact hair dryer. Works really well!
Love this dryer especially the cool setting which I use for the first week after I color my hair.  It's lightweight and doesn't make a lot of noise.
"It's hot but not burn your hair hot, and powerful.  It's definitely worth buying"
"Reasonably priced, light, works well, you can turn off the heat so that it's just blowing room temperature air which is safer for your hair...got it for the GF who loves it.  Amazon's price is much better than anything I could find locally."
"I've had this hair dryer for about twelve years now and my sister always uses it when she's here, so I got her one for Christmas.  It has so much power for such a compact dryer.  When mine dies, I'm going to order another one.  Love it!"
"Purchase this hair dryer to use for travel, it folds and is small but has lots of power. Works great"
It was delivered within a few days and I really like it.  It was really nice to be able to hang the cord and get it off my counter.
"I hesitated to spend this much money on a hair dryer, and I am so happy I did.  I have always purchased the cheaper drug store ones and they not worth it- my hair is so much smoother and healthier with this dryer!"
Love it.  It really works really well and is compact and light..It heats ups fast and gets the job done.Thanks
Great folding hair dryer for a great price.  I needed a hair dryer to take on the Fantasy carnival cruise.  The Glory had a hair dryer in the drawer but unfortunately the Fantasy did not.  It is going on another cruise this Fall on the same Fantasy.
this blush palette lasts forever because even the smallest amount is still enough. many to choose from to go with different makeup looks.  some of them are kind of orangy tho. i stick with the bronzes and pinks
"I have had this product for a month and a half it it has worked wonderfully every morning. Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability. I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold. Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!"
This hair dryer is a very powerful unit that exceeds all my expectations. I am so glad I got this unit from Conair. The dryer arrived before the specified date and I use it all the time to dry my hair.
A nice hairdryer.  Strong yet more quiet than the previous folding model.  You can dry your hair in a couple of minutes. Convenient for travel yet more durable looking than the older model that I had for many years.
High heat setting is practically automatic (don't have to wait for it to heat up).  And the blower on the high setting is very powerful.  This unit is even better than the ones we've used at hotels.  Highly recommend.
This hairdryer is working out well for me. It is hard for me to believe that the ionic conditioning feature really works but it really seems to!  My hair has less static in it after I use this dryer on it. This winter has seemed unusually static filled so this is a welcome relief.
Love this dryer! Pretty color and I am absolutely digging the retractable cord! Works perfectly! I read that some folks were not happy with the length of the cord but I found it to be more than long enough for me. Im not sure why you would need it any longer. Very satisfied customer!
"I've always thought that the wall-mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms were a great idea.  They don't take up space on your bathroom counter, you don't have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer (which can eventually lead to internal wire damage), and you don't have to find a separate place to store it.  I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.  My granddaughter told me the other day that she needs one of these.  Guess I know what she's getting for Christmas this year."
Its just what I needed. Its a simple blow dryer but it works just fine for being so cheap. I like how its effective in the mornings after a long shower.
Folds. Nice. For the small size it dries hair very well. Fits in suitcase very well. The plug is a little bulky but very safe. Good product.
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer! I am not willing to spend $50 or more on a fancy hair dryer, so I hoped this one would be close enough. It works great - better than expected! Dries fast and gets plenty hot. It comes with several attachments which fit securely and don't fall off. Also love the miles-long cord so I can stand anywhere in the bathroom while drying my hair!"
"I broke my very old hair dryer (also 1875 watts) and was looking for a good replacement. This one was surprisingly cheap but doesn't look that way in person. The matte finish look and feels lovely in your hands, and it has some weight to it so you don't feel like it's going to break if you wave it around. I have shoulder-blade-length hair and it can dry my hair in 2-3 minutes flat."
"I already owned this blow dryer, but purchased a second one for travel. I really like this dryer for it's ease of use, temperature and air settings.  I like that the operating buttons are a slide up and down. This is a great feature since you don't accidentally turn the blow dryer off or change the settings while you are drying your hair, like other dryers with elevated buttons. I have a lot of hair and it's thick and this blow dryer, drys it very quickly. The heat is not overly hot, it's just right! The lower settings are perfect for styling. The dryer is also light weight. The price is lower than anywhere else and it arrived quickly and no shipping!"
"Tacks onto the wall very nicely.  It comes with double sided thick tape and places for screws.  I used the tape and haven't had any problems in over month.    I saw these in hotels all the time and loved the convenience.  Now I don't have to deal with dragging it out of the closet every morning.  It's right there hanging next to the mirror.    I found it to be plenty powerful, and not too hot.  The lower setting is good if you don't want to disturb someone who is sleeping.  The high setting is powerful and loud."
Pleased with packaging and shipping. Pleased with product. Its better than our other brands and love how fast it dries my hair and leaves it less frizzy.
My original own died after dropping it several times. Loved this dryer so replaced it. Gets hair dry fast and is not too loud.
"It 's a nice dryer.  It works well.  I don't really use any of the special features, although it has the 3 heat settings and 1 cooling setting.  I just dry my hair."
Works great. I replaced my Sharper Image ion dryer after 10 years with this model. It works great and has the same specs as my other model. Only at a fraction of the price! Highly recommend.
"If you have hair that takes FOREVER to dry, this is the hair dryer for you.  It not only dries your hair, but leaves it soft and shiny. I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I've often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn't anything.  Many times, you'll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don't have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.<br /><br />They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.  It's not as good, but will do in a pinch."
"Love this hair dryer!  Purchased this model after seeing the Good Housekeeping reviews.  Lightweight, the right amount of power to style my hair just right, nice extra features like the cool shot button and the extra long, flexible cord, and all at a reasonable price.  Would definitely recommend this product."
"Whenever I buy a house i always install one of these in the master bathroom.  This is my 3rd one.  Very convenient, very strong, very hot,"
"I have always had excellent luck with Conair hair dryers.  My previous one lasted over five years!  I have been using this one for a week so far and I love it.  It is lightweight and dries your hair quickly (without making you feel like you are going through a wind tunnel).  It is a little smaller than my old dryer, so it would also be useful for travel.  Very nice."
"I mainly purchased this hair dryer to bring some order into our bathroom. A bit more expensive than a standard hair dryer (i.e. just a dryer with a cord), but worth it.  The dryer was easy to mount on the wall.  The cord & dryer now stay out of way, and the night light (sufficient to light that way in the middle of the night) is a nice bonus. Of course, the dryer does a good job as well.  I can recommend this product.  Update: 1 year later, works great.  Bought a 2nd one."
"This is a fantastic littler hair dryer.  Despite the small size, it still gets quite warm and blows a good stream of air on high.  While my hair is fairly short so perhaps this isn't saying much, it does dry it off quite quickly.  The small size is also a plus as it makes it perfect for traveling.  If you're looking for a hair dryer with attachments, you'll need to look elsewhere.  But if you want a good, compact hair dryer, look no further."
Love it very very powerful. And gets hot if you need it to. Cord is average wish it was longer as this feels more like a professional blower. Love the feel of the blower too it doesn't slide out of your hands and it's not very heavy.
Doesn't over dry my hair!  Love it!
"I love this hair dryer. It is a bit heavier than my previous one but my hair dreys faster so I don't mind.  The air blows really hot if you use the highest setting so it took a bit getting used to it, but I love it"
"I have wavy hair that can be coaxed into curls or dried straight. This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair. The diffuser is wonderful. I can put my hair into it and my hair stays without blowing out of it. I get nice, voluminous curly hair. There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both. Otherwise, my hair blows everywhere. Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light. The cord is nice and long. One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems."
"This hair dryer is amazing. It has the perfect temperatures and blow strength. For thick hair that takes long to dry, this is a miracle! And it's very sturdy, firm, robust. It seems that a made a very good choice!"
"It works with it's 3 settings, Hot Warm and Cool. It's also pretty strong and dries my hair quickly (I have long hair). I only wish it came with that angled head attachment so you can blow in a direction."
Love how quiet this dryer is.  It feels good in the hand however it is a bit on the heavy side.  You get used to it after using it for awhile.  Other than the weight issue it is an amazing dryer!
"Nice, easy, portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors.  I use this product with an attachable hood dryer to deep condition my hair.  Very convenient and the retractable cord makes it easy to store without the hassle of dealing with a messy cord."
I liked this hair dryer so much that when my old one finally died I bought another one. Some hair dryers are so loud they sound like a fighter jet taking off. This one is much quieter and is also quite light and easy to maneuver. You can't beat this for the price.
I found it very hard to buy a blow dryer on line but after some research and talking with my hair stylist I decided to purchase the FHI Nano.  I couldn't be happier with this product.  The best feature is the three heat options.  This dryer really does leave your hair looking silky and healthy.  You definately will see a big difference compared to the cheaper dryers.  If you need to replace your dryer this is worth the money.
"This dryer leaves my hair shiny and soft, has good variety of settings, and that necessary cool shot of air to set my hair for the day. Highly recommend! Can't beat the price point."
NO complaint. It is very powerful for the size.
"Love the small but powerful size. Used virtually daily for 5 years and just wore out. I immediately ordered an identical replacement . No clutter on countertop, cord hanger, just a great unit."
This is by far the best hair dryer I have purchased.. I have thick long hair (past my waist) and it dries my hair quickly. Lots of airflow.. for the amount of power I feel it has its a plus that its much smaller then the dryers I've had.. I wouldn't say it was quiet but its not very loud.. it kinda hums instead of the high pitch whistling others have..And im in love with beautiful color and texture.. I bought another as a Xmas gift for my mother-in-law I know she will love it... The 4 yr warranty is a very nice bonus!
No other hair dryer could touch the amazing job that this one does in half the time with no frizz! Love it!
"I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  The super cute tote bag is a plus!  Perfect for travel but I use mine everyday.  I didn't think it would be as good as my big, clunky, heavy dryer, but this little baby gets HOT, has a lower setting also.  I have shoulder/ hand issues and now they don't hurt when I blow dry my hair!  Love it!!"
Best blowdryer ever.  This is my second T3 because the airline broke my first one pitching my luggage. Drys super fast and less damaging.
"I bought this in order to smooth out the wrinkles of the 3M Indoor Window Insulator Kit, and it worked perfectly for that purpose, especially at the highest setting and with the concentrator nozzle attachment. It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that's good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &#34;It's great.&#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used. So I might also recommend reading some of the other reviews... :)"
I bought 2! One for the master bath and one for the kids bath. It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much! And since it's out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair.  I LOVE it! I would recommend it to anybody with kids.
"This is a great unit to organize the bathroom. I'm not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and I'm not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time. This is a great compromise. The unit is always ready to use and it doesn't take up space. Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall. There's no problem with that. I even bought an extra one for my kids' bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough. Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening. Lastly, it's easy to install. Love that part. I highly recommend this product."
"This is my first time purchasing a hair dryer instead of a hand held one. I really like this product, dries hair fast and I can sit comfortably while waiting....the downfall is not being able to hear the television while hair is drying, however it gives me time to check out magazines or read a book while waiting. It is big, so I store it in my closet, luckily I have a walk-in."
This is a great hairdryer. I have a full sized one for home and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes and I have long hair. It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all. I bought this one to put in my gym bag and I was worried that it wouldn't work as well as the full sized version. I highly recommend this hair dryer!
I bought this for a trip to Italy and it worked great for me.  It's very small but also very powerful.  I have a lot of thick curly hair so a need a good hairdryer.  I also bought the diffuser attachment.  I actually think it's better than the hairdryer I use at home!  You will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don't have a voltage converter.  Worth the extra bucks.
"I bought 3 hair dryers at local stores and returned all three -- just not what I wanted.  I kept looking at the Rimini 1800W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic on Amazon -- it was the color that caught my eye first -- that beautiful blue.  After I returned the third dryer, I came back to the Rimini 1800W.  I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up so I wouldn't be changing the settings, and I especially loved the color!  Well, don't let the color sway you.  I ordered the dryer, and it's fabulous!  It's full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don't continually change the settings.  It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that's at medium heat, high power.  I'm so pleased with this hair dryer, and did I mention that I love the beautiful blue color?"
The wife is very happy with this.  It was a replacement of a similar Conair that lasted many years.  This one has held up for a few months now and looks like it will hold up like the old one.  I am pretty sure she will buy a similar Conair if/when this one breaks.
It's really pretty and useful! The delivery is fast! Thanks
"I have several of these hair dryers. I keep one as a back-up in case my other one breaks. It works well, puts out good heat and I love the colors."
"light weight, effective hairdryer. like the folding handle for travel and storage purposes. retractable cord nice feature. wish it had a cool setting or cold shot button. overall, great dryer at a terrific price!"
This dryer is awesome.  Very sturdy and well made.  Gives my thin hairs lots of volume.  It would be perfect if the handle folder after it retracted the cord.  It's a minor complaint for such a good dryer though.
"My wife bought this, but I'll leave my two cents. This is a very quiet hair dryer. I figured that was something interesting that you should know. The air blows smooth and has a cool air button. The weight is about average and comes with two end pieces that I have no idea what they are for. Its a very nice hair dryer. The quiet factor with our sleeping baby is something I didn't expect."
"Came super quick (thanks amazon!) and was a good price!  This just was more convenient to me than going to my local Target and looking through their whole selection, the reviews on Amazon can be so helpful!<br /><br />Its fairly light weight, not too noisy, and seems to work just fine.  My previous model was very simliar, a Revalon.  I see no difference between the two.  I'm sure the 'soft touch' material will eventually peel off like my previous one did but that doesn't really concern me!"
I love it!! I have a bunch of hair and it dries it in no time while other dryers take more than 20 minutes to have way dry it!
This is my second one in 8 years and I think it is great. This new one is for a new home.
"I have long, mid-back length, color treated hair.  I take really good care of it and only use salon products, use heat protectant etc.  I get my hair trimmed regularly, but my ends just felt really dry and my hair was so unmanageable.  My old blowdryer was a Bedhead one and it made my hair so hot I couldn't even touch it.  I decided to invest in the Chi Rocket after reading the great reviews. I honestly can't believe what a huge difference it's made in my hair.  It's amazingly soft and smooth.  I really don't even need to do anything else to it after blowdrying, but I use a big curling iron and it looks fantastic!  I wish I would have bought this years ago!  I will never go back to a cheap blowdryer again!"
My teen age son was leaving his previous dryer laying on the sink.  Sometimes the cord would be IN the sink!  This freaked me out a bit so I ordered this wall unit.  This was easy and quick to install.  I love it!  My son loves it!
So far very happy with the performance of this dryer. My daughter said it really helps minimize the frizzies you get with some hair dryers. I'm hopeful it will last at least a year or two. So many hair dryers quit before you have gotten your money's worth!
"I love tsi-la. Their scents are great and all natural without making you smell like an incense shop. I've tried other natural scents that are overpowering or as my non-crunchy sister would say it smells ethnic in here when I walk into a room. Moving on, all the tsi-la scents I've tried are great. I dont use perfume every day, but I keep this little rollerball in my purse cosmetic bag in case I go to an afterwork event or to freshen up if I'm on the go all day before meeting someone out. I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent! If you are concerned that perfume has toxic, hormone distrupting stuff in it, you owe it to yourself to try Tsi-La!"
I noticed less static in my hair after the first time of using! I also notice more body if I use moose. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer but I have no problem putting up with that if it makes my hair look better! I also thought the price was great compared to other dryers of its likeness.
"I picked this hairdryer because of the high reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed.  My girlfriend loves this hairdryer.  It feels like a quality item when you hold it in your hands."
My wife loves the hair dryer (and she is fussy about such appliances) and my little two year old loves the retracting cord!  Good dryer at a good price.
The product arrived and it is fine  We replaced an old one that broke when it was dropped.  We like the new unit fine.
"There aren't too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available, so this is the one that I've had the most success with. I just wish it were easier to get replacement bonnets. I recently ordered 3 for the dryer that I already had, but the bonnets have been on &#34;back order&#34; for months, so I had to buy a whole new dryer."
The product works as stated and much along the lines of other positive reviews. I have been using the product for about 3 months now and this is the first shower mirror that has been truly fogless. Filling the container with hot water is no hassle and it works great every time.
"This is amazing. It really is quiet. It looks great on the wall too!  Very efficient, I have been using an older model and this<br />very powerful but so quiet. It has the hi and low and it's so comfortable to hold for this grandma!!  I love the added feature, the little side hook that holds the cord up once the dryer is snapped back in the holder.you have thought of everything!"
Product is just as described. Super fast delivery
"First used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it. My own hairdryer finally gave out so I had the opportunity to buy this, very happy with it. Retraction of the cord works very well compared to my previous one, and I feel like I have less frizz after drying my hair with this one, probably because it has the diffuser at the end. Even on the highest setting it's not too hot."
Super fast drying
"My favorite hair dryer, powerful, totally recommended!"
Love this blow dryer.  Hair so much easier to manage with this dryer than my old that just got &#34;hot&#34;.
"Sturdy, not heavy and easy to use."
dryers my hair super fast and no frizz
A great hairdryer. It seems to get my hair dryer faster than ones I've used in the past. The color is pretty too.
This is the third house we have put these into our master baths.  I even have one installed in our RV!  So handy and so much neater in appearance.
I love this hair dryer. It really does leave my hair shiny and softer than my old one.
had the same model before but in blue. this is a newer model as i great. loves the cord retraction
"Great quality, easy to use, heats up fast with lots of power. It's well worth the money invested when you need to replace your outdated blow dryer."
"This Blow dryer is SUPER  I would really recommend it to anybody looking for a blow dryer,  Thank YOU  Diane Heuring"
First tried this item at a hotel. I received compliments on my hair. It also has a nice long cord.  I got one for myself and gave one as a give.
"Andis makes a great product, and I have a white Andis full-sized dryer for the house, but I needed a smaller one for on-the-road travel in my semi truck. This also has dual voltage for overseas travel, so YAY! Get one."
We use this multiple times a day and it is very convenient having it on the wall. Liked the idea after seeing it in hotel rooms.
"This dryer is compact, has a powerful fan and blows a lot of heat. My wife loves it. Not really quiet - like most dryers."
"This is a great color and an unbelievable price for this product.  It's quieter than my last hair dryer, which is a huge bonus.  It does smell funny when drying for about the first two weeks, but then it's fine.  I've recommended this hair dryer to others I know."
"My hair dresser first started me on a T3 about 4 years ago. I loved it. When it began to loose power, I found another T3 on Amazon and am still a T3 fan. I highly recommend this blow dryer - well worth the money."
"I was looking for a hair dryer that was gentler on my hair since I tend to use a flat iron on it daily.  I was using one of the cheapest hair dryers you could buy and once I started using this one, there was a noticeable difference.  It's much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful.  It's also a cute color that is very close to the picture.  It seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer, but you get used to it.  And of course, it's always nice to have a retractable cord.  I'm very happy with this hair dryer so far. :)"
"Great! Quiet, quick, pretty. Lots of setting options. Dries much quicker than my other dryer.  Less frizz too. Definitely my favorite dryer I've had. More professional. Also shipped quickly. I'd recommend."
I felt this dryer was great for the money. It is not one of the best dryers out there but I felt it was sufficient in getting my hair dry in a short time period. I am not one of those folks who wants to wait very long for my hair to dry but I also didn't want to use a towel either. That's why I love this dryer. It is low cost which should be great for those people on a tight budget.
"Best price I have seen, plus great quality! Super quiet, not a giant long annoying cord, not too short of a cord either, love love love the diffuser attachment since I have curly hair, attachments stay on really well, low and warm does a great job on my thin and super curly hair."
"I absolutely love this dryer! It gets really hot on the highest setting which I prefer using because it will dry my hair faster. I like that it is adjustable and you can get a chair and slide it right over. Overall, it did the job of drying my hair and I'm satisfied."
"I had the perfect blowdryer... that was until I moved. Nonetheless, I was pretty worried about getting a new one. I have been through a fair share of terrible no good hair dryers. Looove this one! It's lightweight, only 1.7 lbs compared to some that are 2.5 or even 3! I like that it has a retractable cord, which will make for easier traveling. That goes for the folding handle as well. The HIGH is actually really high powered, I was surprised. And the settings are perfect, in my opinion; the warm isn't too hot (like some I've experienced)."
"I had been using something similar for years.  It had belonged to my 95 year old mother and lasted through her life and most of mine and one morning I turned it on and zilch, it had died.  Since I am pretty much housebound I wondered what to do next.  Good ole amazon came to the rescue.  It arrived much sooner than originally planned and I was delighted.  The equipment works extremely well with various speeds and protective gear for a bathroom switch.  The only fault I found was that there were other pieces for directing air flow that came with no explanation of how to connect them.  I don't use them anyway but it would have been nice to have had some directions especially for the mechanically impaired like myself.  Otherwise a wonderful hair dryer for a cheap price."
"This is a beautiful chrome/gun metal looking dryer with an extra long cord that I love. The first day I got it,  I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water- it was completely submerged. It immediately shut off as soon as it hit the water.  I left it to dry and the next day I plugged it in and it WORKED.  I was pretty impressed."
This is an amazing professional hair dryer!!! I brought this dryer for my sister as a Christmas present 2014 and she was overjoyed!!!
With a four year warranty I had to try it and now I'm in love. It doesn't take an hour for me to dry my hair..WITHOUT blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess. It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I've owned. It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don't accidentally turn on and off while drying. I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day. After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.
Just as fast drying as promised.  Glad for the force choices.  The high speed seems to tangle my straight bob
Great mini dryer with plenty of power. Only problem is that it's loud on high setting.
"I LOVE THIS!  I  have average hair thickness. I love this drier. It's small and light and easy to manipulate.  It has a good blow strength.  Its my second one.  The first one lasted 5 years, but it was only $15.00. I am ok with that. I like it because it is easy to hold and manipulate in different directions to self- style."
"This blow dryer is perfect! Recommended to me by my hair stylist after she used it on my hair, and I immediately purchased right after my hair appointment! Dries my hair fast, allows you to change the speed and temperature, and also features a &#34;cool shot&#34; button! Plus it comes with the awesome add on to attach to the end and direct air flow! Came fast and exactly as described! Plus the pink is super cute, it is a lighter pink than pictured than...but you won't be disappointed! :)"
Love this hairdryer! So fast and light. Cut styling time in half
"Despite the fact that it doesn't have any air temperature settings (air temp and strength are all combined I think, as low, medium and high), I greatly prefer this hair dryer over my old traditional style one. The comb attachments are AWESOME, and I feel like my hair dries much quicker and straighter now that I use them. The way the dryer vertically spreads the air throughout your hair leads to quicker and more even blow drying times and styles as well.<br /><br />I haven't used the brush attachement with the blowdryer but actually sometimes use it to just brush my hair when it's wet haha- works like a charm!"
"Quality hair dryer, works perfectly. You do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall. Runs and runs and runs forever, really."
i'm a big world traveller & this is the best one i've used. small & lightweight. seemed about right the right price.
Great little hair dryer for traveling with. Power is more than adequate for my usage. Wish it came in other colors.
My hairdresser recommended this oil while I was at the shop one day.  She stated it was the only product from which she got results after chemo.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.  I don't have frizzies and it does not weigh my hair down.  Not only is it great for my hair but its good for my skin.  The fragerance is clean and fresh.
I use it every other day to dry my hair because I always wash hair at night. It is very useful to me. It has good quality and strong wind. And it looks pretty.
"Even though I just got this week, I used on both my daughters hair to blow out for the first time!!! I bought this because I remembered my former stylist using this tool on my hair years ago!  I saw the price and jumped on it!  It's not fancy but it has four settings from cool to high heat and if you know how to use a blow dryer properly then you should be fine!  Thanks Amazon for having st half the price as Walmart! :). Worked like s charm on my girls and I only used cool and warm heat! ;) they have lots of curly hair!"
"Exactly what I wanted, very small and very powerful. Perfect for travel. Amazon should make it easier to go back in and order another, no option for that on your confirmation site after you get the product."
"Love this hair dryer. Heats up nicely. Light weight can sit anywhere comfortably. Works like a charm. I definitely recommend this particular hair dryer to any one. The bonnet is very large, durable and adjustable. Will probably never purchase the hard hair dryer again. It has a. Compartment for the bonnet and the power cord. Real easy to use."
Great blow dryer! It takes half the time to blow dry my hair like my old one did and takes a lot of the frizz off too. I LOVE this blow dryer. Highly recommend it. Shipped Fast!!
The only con is the weight. It's pretty heavy but it works perfectly.
"I love how lightweight this thing is, while still being powerful.  I gave it to my mom for Christmas, and when I'm home, I usually go into her bathroom to use it because it's better than mine."
Dries my hair fast and love the cool shot button. What I don't like is that it has a big square plug.
Low air on the first but the 2nd was great. It is in the guest bath so know one evr has to pack the monster blow dryer.
"I stayed at a hotel in Chicago that used these in their room, and was so amazed by how much power comes out of this tiny little unit that I googled how much they cost, to learn that they are only around $25!  Now it's my go to travel dryer, and everybody is always so impressed with it.  I will be buying more, and I hope they never stop making these things!"
This is compact and puts out more air than my full sized blow dryer.  I bought it because of it's dual voltage settings because I work internationally and will be traveling to Ireland soon.  I have been using it every day since I got it because I like it so much.
This is the second one I bought.  My daughter took the first one because she liked it so much.  I hope to get a lot of use from it.
Having fine hair I find the 1875 watt hair dryers a little too forceful to be able to style my hair while drying it so I was looking for a 1600 watt hoping that it would make a difference and it did. They are hard to find so I was really happy to find this one. It's nice lightweight and even comes with some styling tools.I personally couldn't be happier!
Great little hair dryer! I needed something that was easy to pack for traveling AND had a diffuser. I love this little dryer.
This is a great hair dryer. It has a nice weight to it and a nice smooth matte finish. I have very long hair and this hair dryer works faster than anything I've ever owned. It's also surprisingly quiet to use. I'm just sad I can't take it with me when I travel.
"This sponge arrived sooner than expected and as described, in brand new condition. This is an amazing product and I will be purchasing again!"
I love it for its practicality and efficiency.  It is quiet all right.
What a huge difference this dryer has made on my hair with only using it one time!! My hair has no more frizz!! I'm so happy :-)
This thing dries my hair super quick. Cuts my morning routine in half and my hair is way smoother since I bought this. Doesn't get super hot but very powerful!
"I had my reservations before I bought this, but I am so glad I did! It is small enough to travel with and has loads of power to dry even the thickest head of hair. Great purchase!!"
"I'm a hairdresser, so I can sometimes go through blowdryers easily. However, this one has lasted over a year! I've bought TwinTurbo dryers before, but this model is compact enough that I can transport it from work to home easily, but the quality is not sacrificed. I love the black matte plastic, too. It makes any scratches or dings practically invisible."
Hair dyer works great for it's size. It doesnt over heat like some customers say it does. Works great for condisioning and dying hair. Only drawback I see is it's hard getting everything back into the case
My hair has come out fantastic every time with this. The attachments are great. The only thing is that the attachments are hard to get on...but it works. Love it and highly recommend.
"I love my T3 micro featherweight luxe hair dryer.  I had used my friends sultra hair dryer and loved it... so I started to research investing in a quality hair dryer myself and decided on the T3.  I can't believe how much faster my hair dries with it and my hair is so much silkier now.  Truly frizz free!  It is very light weight and easy to use.  I actually took the time to plug in my old conair hair dryer and compare to my new T3, and it felt like someone was just blowing on my head to dry it,lol.  It really made me value my new dryer.  My hair is straighter and easier to maintain with out all the old ways I used to use to style."
"I read about the John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer in a magazine, and it has more than lived up to its review.  Dries quickly, leaves hair soft, WITH NO FRIZZIES, and with lots of body.  It's made my wavy, mind-of-its-own hair behave for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.  Couldn't live without it."
"This is light weight, inexpensive, and was a great improvement from the travel hairdryer that finally broke after 10 years of use.  I could definitely feel the soft and smoothing effects of the tourmaline.  In fact I loved it so much that I bought another one when I was able to find it at Target for $13.  Plus it's soft material does not scrap your walls or furniture when they rub against each other.    Highly recommend it!"
excellant hair dryer that mounts on wall to save counter space. Excellant hot air to dry hair quickly . Nice nightlight that works automaticlly.
This hair dryer was recommended by my hair stylist. It would cost $200 at a retail store. She suggested I check on Amazon for a better price. I got the hair dryer for half the retail price. The ionic ceramic tourmaline dryer is less damaging to hair. The best thing is that it's quiet for a blow dryer ... more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers.
"I like it, but it doesn't really sound like a normal hair dryer, it sounds more like a vacuum."
"Love this little guy.  Good for short to medium hair, but not for long hair.  Nightlite is nice touch."
"I have very curly, color treated hair that gets too curly and frizzy when dried with a diffuser. This dryer is perfect to dry my hair and do deep conditioning treatments. I usually let my hair air dry, which can take 2 hours! With the dryer, I put it on cool for about 25-30 minutes while I return emails, and I'm good to go! I like the ability to roll it around as well as the temp and timer dials. Shipping was very fast! I've used it about 3 times per week for a couple of weeks, and so far so good!"
"My purchase of the Hot Tools Tourmaline Ionic Standing Hair Dryer was a great investment. I love the purple and black color. It has two heat settings, high and low. Two speed settings, high and low, and it has an on/off ionic knob. It has an adjustable pole which is great when you have more than one person using it. It also has wheels so it is easy for me to roll it around the house. This is much better that the hooded dryer that I had to sit on the table and find a chair low enough so I could fit under the hood. I use my dryer on a weekly basis. The hood is very roomy and has a flip up front. I can dry my hair with large rollers with no problem. Now I can get the salon feel of the hair dryer at home."
"Its a great hairdryer, it blows hot air, at 3 speeds with a cold air setting. I can't imagine what else a hair dryer needs to do? and at $10 amazing value ;)"
"I actually like this blow dryer very much. It makes my hair very smooth and silky. And I don't have a problem with the settings or placement of the switches, as others have stated. I would recommend this blow dryer to anyone."
I have been using this for for a few weeks and am impressed.  It replaced a 10 year old dryer and has made a difference in my morning routine.  It seems a bit heavier than my old one but the speed of drying is worth it.
"While this is bigger than the very small dryer it replaced, it is a light weight at the other, drys hair in minutes, and overall is exactly what I wanted.  I read most of the reviews of this dryer and others before ordering.  I know Conair products are good and a good value.  I'm satisfied with this purchase in every way."
I love sitting under the dryer and being able to read or do handwork and getting my hair dried hands free. I do wish it had 3 settings instead of just the two. It is either hot or cold and I would love to have medium as it does get quite hot but I love being able to do something with my hands rather than holding the dryer.
No complaints. It's light and not too noisy. It has 2 blowing speeds and 2 levels of heating which is enough for me to adjust as I need. I am using it for the last 6 month with no problems so far. I got it thru Amazon and happy with it.
"Don't hesitate, it works perfectly. Very fast.  .  .  .  .  .  .. .. . . . . . ."
Got the Elchim a few weeks ago and love it so far! Blows my curly hair out quickly and nice and smoothly. I highly recommend it!
"After several failed attempts trying to buy a Remington Shortcut that would hold a charge, I stumbled onto the Philips Norelco QC5170. It is by far the best hair clipper I have ever owned.   First things first...this baby holds a charge! It has over an hour of run time on a full charge. And if the charge does run out, it works with its AC charger plugged in. So you're never stuck with half a haircut and a dead set of clippers.   The cutter is powerful. The blades move fast so they don't pull your hair, they cut it.  Its adjustable cut settings and its pivoting spacer comb combine to produce a great, easy haircut. I also use it to trim my beard. The primary spacer comb easily pops off for easy cleaning, or to attach one of the specialty combs and cutters that also come with it.  I enthusiastically recommend this product."
Love it so far. Very strong blowing unlike some of the other dryers I've owned.
This is an amazingly sturdy and powerful hair dryer.  Really dries my hair quickly and allows for easy styling.  This one should last me a long time.
"I bought this to blow dry my baby's hair. It is the perfect size for her when she gets older to dry her own hair. It is strong enough to dry hair quickly, but not to the point of burning hair/scalp."
"Ok, yes, it is a little bulky, but it's because it has tons (and I mean tons!) of power, which you can easily control so you don't burn your hair. The cord can be &#34;sucked in&#34; in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away. Beautiful!"
"My wife and I needed a new hair dryer, and we had good luck with Conair in the past, so I thought I would try this new model which was just introduced.  Works really great, and much much quieter than the old one, too.  Absolutely would recommend it!  5 Stars."
I am a professional stylist and this blow dryer gets the job done!!! It is excellent for straightening natural African American hair.
amazing dryer !! it makes my hair soft and easy dry. Even though the price is expensive but I really recommend this product to others ! i like pink color very pretty. very useful !!!!
"I love that this comes with a little diffuser. For a little guy, it does a very good job."
"I'm really pleased with this product and hope the Dial in this scent will remain available for purchase over time. I use antibacterial liquid pump soap in both kitchen and bath, but prefer a non-medicinal and non-floral scent. The scent of this is very light and smells exactly like apples in the autumn, with just a light hint of spice in the background. The product lathers up very well, but rinses clean easily, leaving my hands soft and feeling healthy and refreshed, but not at all greasy like a moisturizer usually feels. The scent lingers only for a little while and does not make me feel like I am leaving it behind in foods I prepare after washing my hands. I've had guests over since I bought this soap and both times they commented on what a lovely scent it had when they washed their hands in the bathroom. This is my favorite so far in any of the types and scents available from standard brands of liquid antibacterial soaps in a pump container. I also love that I could buy in volume at a good price, so as to not run out suddently. I would recommend this product highly for those who prefer antibacterial liquid soaps, but aren't fond of flowery or medicinal scents."
"I am so glad I got this little hair dryer. I have thick, wavy hair and I need a powerful hair dryer to dry it. This is very powerful, more so than my at home hair dryer. I love the retractable cord. Easy for traveling. I weighed it on my kitchen scale and it weighs just slightly over 1 1/4 pounds. I thought it would weigh more. A good purchase."
"Awesome dryer! I was on the fence for a while but now I'm addicted. Leaves my fine, fizzy, dry hair soft and smooth and my hair just keeps getting healthier. If you are waiting, don't...you just have to try this once and you will be sold!"
Great hair dryer. good weight. I have coarse wavy hair that takes a long time to dry. This hair dryer does a better than average job of drying my hair quickly
It dries hairs fast and with a silky look!<br /><br />Takes less time to get wonderful results and it's low noise.<br /><br />I recomend it
"Very affordable, reviews were accurate.  It is quieter than my old one and quick.  No need to spend a lot of money on a dryer when you have the quality with Conair."
"The blow dryer works great, so far i have had no issues with it. The retractable cord is convenient. It al o is not as noisy as some other blow dryers."
"I bought this blow dryer because my friend had one and loved it. Well, I love mine too! This dryer will dry your hair quickly without causing damage. It also reduces frizz really well, especially when used with a round brush. They sell this exact same hair dryer at the salon where I get my hair cut... at three times the price!!! I would highly recommend! This is a great deal."
"This blow dryer packs a lot of power.  Small, convenient and easy to use.  The wall mount keeps it nicely tucked away between uses.  It is exactly like the ones you find in hotels which is what I was looking for."
"I love this dryer.  It has improved the texture and whole condition of my hair.  My (African-American) hair is less frizzy, smoother and calmer.  I'm buying two more for my sisters as Christmas presents."
"this dryer is very compact, and has good power for a little dryer.  I purchased it for my travel bag and used it for the first time this weekend.  I was very impressed with how hot it got, how small it was, how well it worked, and how fast it cooled after using it.  I would highly recommend."
I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling. It is small and packs easily. The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad. It actually had two speeds when I used it in Europe. Often hair dryers have two speeds in the states but when traveling abroad with the change in voltage they do not. I was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad. I would highly recommend it for foreign travel.
"This product has delivered higher results than I expected. This was my third purchase; I take the recommended six tablets per day; I'm in my fourth month of using this supplement and I plan to continue with it, indefinitely. Initially, there was a substantial weight loss - a little too much for me - but I've since regained what I needed. My fine hair seems no thicker - but - where there was a noticeable receding hairline, all the hair has regrown and that sure is wonderful. Complexion and fingernails show nice improvements, but the most remarkable for me is that I no longer need to wear supports for my ankles when I'm active. I suffered a degree of permanent damage to the tendons in both ankles many years ago, to the point that I had to be careful just getting out of bed in the morning. Now, I am pain free and enjoy wearing the shoes of my choice.  Overall, I credit this product with substantial improvement to the quality of my life and I would highly recommend giving it a try."
"This is a marvelous shave!! Nothing else that I have ever used is anywhere near as comfortable! Use it with a Gel Lather and you will never ever again feel the discomfort of Razor Burn no matter how hard you work, or workout, and prespire...EveR!!!"
"Fits the bill perfectly. I sought a small, efficient hair dryer that could hang up in my very small bathroom and be unobtrusive but effective.  The cord - hanger is a plus, allows the coiled cord to be placed out of the way.  I disagree with some reviewers who found it very noisy on high setting. This dryer is just fine."
I love this dryer and wish they made it in a smaller travel size. Only drawback is that the attachment bends easily so if you pack it make sure to take it off first. It heats up better than any other dryer I've used and my salon uses these exclusively.
This is a wonderful product. I like how it has a &#34;coo/warm/hot&#34; switch AND a &#34;low/high&#34; switch and not just one switch making you choose low and cool or hot and high. I also love the little attachment it comes with to give a more concentrated blow to a specific section of hair. I would definitely buy this product again.
I had this blow dryer a few years ago it lasted 6 yrs. I have since gone through the chi which broke in 6 months & solano which has completely destroyed my hair....only because I couldn't remember the name of my old dryer. It was just recently while asking a friend if she knew of a good blower that i was reconnected with the twin turbo. It is by far the best blow dryer I have ever had!!
While staying in a motel I used this and fell in love! My hair comes out smoother.. love the multiple settings.. this works so well I purchased a second for when my new one wears out!!! Good blow dryers are hard to come by.
"I don't write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  I have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer, but like I said,  my hair is only shoulder length. If you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity,  buy this dryer.  You will not regret it."
"I have never really bought anything online and this is the first review I've ever written. That said, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I didn't know a hair dryer could *style* my hair. This product is much more powerful than my previous $15 drugstore purchase. That feature helps tame cowlicks! Overall, I have no complaints. I am very happy!!"
"Have used this dryer in hotels and when my old dryer died, I purchased this one.  Have had it a few months now and absolutely love it.  It is the only dryer I have used that has both a low and a high fan volume on the cool setting in addition to the heat settings. It's mounted in the guest bathroom and everyone who has stayed with us have commented how great it is and how nice it looks."
I love the folding handle & retractable cord. Compact & light. Still strong enough for blow drying a long hair.
"I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it.  I ordered one for myself as soon as I returned home.  Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure I can't style it properly.  Medium works great for me.  Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited.  As others have mentioned, be careful not to pull the cord out too far, as mine stopped retracting after 18 months.  With almost 3 years of daily use, it finally died.  I immediately ordered another one.  At this price, one every 3 years is a bargain."
"Does what it is supposed to do. Could maybe blow air a little stronger but otherwise, a perfectly good hair dryer. Comes with a diffuser and a concentrator (that I will never use...)"
"The best dryer ever, I go through hair dryers like crazy, finally I have found one I love!"
I love this out of the way blow dryer!  For the price you can't beat it!  It actually looks pretty cute on my wall in my small bathroom.
"I bought this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter. I also own one and so does my other daughter. We absolutely love this hair dryer. It has 3 speed settings (low, med, high), 2 temperature settings (low, high), and a cool button. It is nicely powered with each setting and very nicely made. I've had mine for a few years now and the reel cord still works as well as it did the day I purchased it. If you are considering buying this product I would highly recommend it!!"
"I love this dryer not only is it QUIET, it really does make my hair shiny and silky.  I bought this because I simply needed a dryer and thought if it could do anything else it would just be a bonus.   I have straight hair which tends to be more shiney than layered, I liked how my hair felt-particularly here where it can be extremely humid. I was pleasantly surprised.  Although another reviewer found the weight a problem, it was no heavier than my old dryer. I love it!!!!"
"I really am very pleased with my purchase of the Conair 225RX tourmaline Ceramic 1875 Watt hair drier.  It dries my daughter's long thick hair much faster than my old drier.  It produces a nice strong hot breeze, yet it doesn't get too hot that she complains of it burning her (on lower heat seting).  Her hair seems shinier too.  Whole family loves it!!!  Highly recommend it.  The price was reasonable also!!!"
"Love this hair dryer.  Cool, medium, high settings great...but the key is that it is LIGHT weight.  An ionic dryer without being my work-out also!  Shiny hair in quick time.  Why did I wait so long to buy a product that works?"
"This hair dryer met all of my expectations. I love its compact design. The bonnet is large enough to fit over rollers, and on the medium heat setting it gets warm enough to dry my hair in 10 minutes. I think it's a quality product with a thoughtful design."
"After receiving a Conair cordkeeper for Christmas and only using it about 8 times, it died. Lucky I was able to get my money back at Walmart. So I decided to read lots of Amazon reviews on hairdryers in the $20-$30 price range and chose this one.<br />I loved it the first time I used it! It's a bit heavier but not bothersome at all, and I even have tennis elbow which prevents me from lifting things a certain way, if they weigh over 3# or so. This is very comfortable in the hands, has enough settings, a cold shot button, and most importantly, a diffuser for when I want to go from stick straight hair to beachy waves. The quality seems great and sturdy, I love the pink on it, and whatever the coating is is also pretty cool.<br />After my Conair experience, I don't have much faith in new hairdryers. I was using an old folding travel dryer I have (from 2007) that still works great and I plan on using for traveling, so my intent was to use the Remington for the diffuser. However, I think I will use it everyday, as it dries my hair fast and keeps it shiny and is just fun to use!"
"This is a great hair dryer - it seems to be designed well. It's definitely pretty - doesn't take up too much space. It has all the features that I need, like multiple heat settings, multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style. It fits standard hair dryer attachments too -  like a diffuser. It also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast - I think it's called the nozzle, but it's key to minimizing damage on your hair.<br /><br />My last hair dryer (from a different brand) was closer to $65 and although it worked great, it started to breakdown within a couple of months. It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight. The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.<br /><br />I also love the follow up communication I received after buying this - tips for how to use it well, contact info if I have any problems. So, I'm happy with the dryer, but communication from xtava has been really great - the next time I'm in the market to buy something like this, I'll check xtava first."
Great hair dryer...I use it when on the road or at the gym.  I like the powerful yet quiet air blast it emits (when compared to a previously owned Conair that died)...this is definitely an improvement and I recommend this effective product.
"I love this lightweight blow dryer it is fantastic and it is super quiet and doesn't frizz my hair out. The plug fits into my outlet well, my last blow dryer it hogged u to plug spaces. After reading some reviews on the T3 and hair stylist using this product I committed. It is pricey but worth it to me."
"not super strong, but does the job. can't beat the price :)"
Dries faster than I expected. Cools  off quickly with the side mount hanging.  Love the night light.  Just enough light.
I couldn't believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price. I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn't afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer. I did a lot of shopping around and finally came across this one that even came with the attachments I was looking for. I bought it and was worried that for the price the product wouldn't be as described. I received it and it has 3 different heat settings and two different levels. It also came with the attachments which work great! This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road. If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.
"I am thrilled with this hair dryer.  It is better than even I imagined.  Looked at several at the local beauty supply houses... all with huge price tags.  I am so happy with this one, I can't begin to explain.  My hair is not fly-away like it is with my old dryer.  It has plenty of volume and is sleek and shiny.  I can't believe it took me so long to buy such a quality dryer.  I recommend this highly!"
My hair dryer broke and I needed a replacement.  I keep my hair dryer plugged in by my sink and I worried about my grandkids accidentally dropping it in the sink so I bought this wall mounted unit.  I absolutely love it.  So convenient and it's more powerful than my old hair dryer.  I may get another one for the other bathroom.
"As I had minimal space on our bathroom  counter I needed a hair dryer that could hang out of the way.  I was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below.  Thus it is out of sight when not in use and very available when needed.  As far as the function of the dryer, it lives up to my expectations."
"I ordered for this hair dryer because of the advantages i saw.I have had a revlon dryer i had used for a long time and i guess i was due for a change.<br />I really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings.I was able to get this dryer down to Africa,from the U.S.However,on receiving Infiniti Conair dryer;i was so anxious to use it.Like my custom has always been, i read the manual and was so suprised it was a 125volts!I was so dissappointed...i have not been able to use the product since i received it.<br />My question is how do i use the product since my country has a voltage of 220volts.I would really love to."
"I used this hairdryer for the first time at a resort that we were staying at and just loved it.  I loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head,  it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better that what I had used previously.  Before I left the resort I went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then.  I highly recommend this dryer!"
Great value purchased 2 large bottles for the price of one small bottle.  My husband loves this cologne and now my son does to.
"Fantastic little hair dryer I bought for my trip later this year. I've only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in Australia, but it seems great so far. Make sure if you're Australian and you plug it in with the adapter that you don't put it on high! I didn't read the instructions and nearly blew it up haha. Can only be used on low here, but that's fine as it's for my trip to the US anyways. Was quite powerful and I think it'll be perfect."
"Who knew all hair dryers were not created equal!  Great price for a hair dryer that doesn't fry your hair.<br /><br />I have super thick hair and this dryer cuts my dry time in half compared to my last old cheap dryer.<br /><br />Price is good, great product!"
You can tell right away this is a heavy duty hair dryer. I wanted something that had some power to it and couldn't find it at my local Target.  This is a great product. I have been practicing blow outs and its prefect for this.  So as much as this is more pricey than a normal blow dryer it is worth it.
"If you happen to be looking for a no-frills nice performing basic hair dryer this is precisely that--it offers no bells and whistles but for the price no one should expect such. My deciding variable in a hair dryer is does it blow-dry with power or is it somewhat lacking in this area (I've had my share of the low power models and I am quite picky here). Verdict: it's plenty powerful and allows for a quick exit out the door every morning.<br /><br />***Update*** As of today 10-21-16 I officially lay to rest this device. Honestly, It has been used 24/7/365 for just about 2.5 years which for me qualifies as a resounding endorsement of the product (at the time I paid $11). I am by no means an expert in this area but I assume it's not common to get much more than several years at best for a hair-dryer subject to daily use."
"so glad I purchased this one, so many options out there, but I didn't want to spend a lot, so I choose this based off the reviews, so glad I did. it works great, is super fast compared to all other driers ive had, which is many, and I love the ion, I wont buy one without it, and can tell a difference with ion! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air, which is great, you don't have to change the switch to cool air, just hole in the blue button on any setting! GREAT! it gets hot, but not so hot that it burns your neck (or my daughters neck, which is always a problem with the girls, she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect), however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly, which is a great deal for her, since that was her other problem with them. and its great for me too, since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair, now I can fully dry it in that amount of time! it is easy to hold/handle, and has all the options that an expensive dryer would, with the add ons (2 different ones!), they clip on and off easy also! it is sturdy, I have had it for a couple months, and I am very rough with them, leave them in the bathroom, laying out, or tucked beside the makeup table, laying in floor, or just through under the cabnit,, and I have had no issues at all, it doesn't have a scratch on it! amazing! i would recommend this to everybody, my sis already got the same one, after using mine,since she loved it, and still does after a month, and now my mom has the same one as well, and we all bought them on here, to be sure it was the exact same one, since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same! so, yes, recommended, love it, love it , love it!"
"This thing is great.  I mounted it in our bathroom and my wife quit using her hair dryer at her make-up station and starting using this one instead.  the nightlight is a nice bonus feature.  There are no heat settings.  The default heat setting I would say is medium.  It is not quiet, but I don't think it is louder than other hair dryers.  I think it is a bit higher pitched probably from the compact design.  Nothing is removable so I don't think we'll be needing to replace any parts.  I would buy another one if I needed one."
"Even though heavier than my other travel dryer, this one worked well on my last trip. I like the ion technology, it does seem to eliminate a lot of the frizzies. I also like that it has THREE settings for blowing. Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush. The retractable cord made is easy to travel with."
"It arrived quickly, was a beautiful red, light as a feather and, on high, dries hair super-quickly.  Also, it's much quieter than my previous one with all the added power."
"I'm only giving these a 3/5 for now becuase the heating element was broken on arrival.  I thought it was strange that it didn't get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).  Very happy!  Love the feel and heft of it, too."
"Amazing for a small hair dryer.  Folds up nicely and is just as strong as an average hair dryer.  Has lasted about 6 months and feels just as solid and powerful as it did when I first got it.<br /><br />Also has a safety GFCI breaker on the plug, which is just more of a testament to quality, but can also save your life if you're using this somewhere that doesn't have one."
"I got this hair dryer b/c I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that's exactly what I got. It performs exceptionally well and I have even dried - wait for it - CHICKENS w/ it outside. It's that sturdy. :) B/c I'm a woman I'm not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment."
"This hair dryer works great. It has lots of power and dries super fast. A little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle, it still fits in my carry bag."
Amazing!! I highly recommend this blow dryer. Not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny. I feel like I had it professional styled. I have long straight brown hair so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue..but not with this dryer...
Very good blow dryer! I usually buy very cheap ones but splurged a little this time. Love it! It is a little heavier than I'm used to.
"TOTALLY RECOMENDED!! HAIR DRIES VERY FAST, I JUST GOT MINE AND IM PLEASED USING IT EVERY DAY SINCE I GOT IT"
"Let's face it, I'm a guy.  I use a hair dryer about 3 minutes every morning when I get out of the shower.  I don't need tourmaline gemstone coated heating elements, I don't need salon-duty roller bearings, I don't need a pink gemstone-encrusted handle.<br /><br />I need something that blows hot air out the front when you press the switch, and this model does it.  Works fine, without all the bells, whistles, and gee-gaws, and without breaking the bank.  Oh and it's blue.  A good guy color."
"All I know is I straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time, this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1/2 minutes!  I love the retractable cord and it's small, sleek size.  Great buy for the price!"
I really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend. I find that my travel sized hairdryer works best in this.
"It's powerful hair dryer. And there're many buttoms to secure the user's safty. I like it.<br />While, it's a little noisy."
This blow dryer dries my hair in half the time my old one did. My hair is really curly and I like it better straight and this product has the power to make my hair nice and smooth without much effort. It has a cool blast switch to lock the style in place. I don't have to use as much hair product because this blow dryer makes my hair straight with basically just a brush. If you have frizzy hair this is the blow dryer for you
"I was looking for something compact and light weight and this was smaller than I expected it to be! Does a great job in drying my hair quickly. The high mode is a bit loud but if you don't want to use high, the low option works good too."
"The off-on switch on my old Conair travel dryer broke after 5-6 years, so I purchased this one after reading reviews. It's even more compact than the old one, and I was pleased to find that it came with a 6' cord, unlike the old dryer that had a curly cord that wouldn't stretch far. It dries my hair in about 3 minutes, and the long cord and two heat settings make it ideal for drying my dogs after bathing, too. The only thing missing is a case for the hair dryer. The old Conair came with one and I saved it - the new one fits perfectly."
I love this blowdryer. It is light-weight and portable. I love how it folds up for when I travel. It is also super powerful and I can dry my long hair in just 5 - 10 min.
We are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had. It has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults. I have recommended this hair dryer to friends.
My daughter purchased this and because she wanted something cheap and in-expensive but with good quality. This was perfect. It came with the Concentrator. The one negative thing I have to say is that my daughter would've liked to have something like the Universal Finger Diffuser. Other then that it has really nice settings Low Med and High with a cooler button and it isn't very heavy.
"I was actually giddy the first time I used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body.  This baby plus a little mousse work wonders.  My hair is fine and not extremely thick, and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when I want a more glamourous look.  I feel it was worth the splurge, although I'm glad I bought it when I did (a few months ago) because the price has since gone up on it."
The motor is quieter than dryers I've owned in the past. Easy to operate. Love the cord reel! Does a fast job of drying my hair.
Love it. The controls are easy to use but do not get in your way.  It runs much quieter than other hair dryers I've used.
"Love this hair dryer. Used this model for about 8 years. Yes the give out like all hair dryers and I have to buy a new one, but quality is always the same when I have to get a new one. Very powerful and dries hair quickley!"
"Best hair dryer I have ever purchased!  I have always bought the high end expensive hair dryers, but this one far exceeds any dryer I have bought!  Not too hot, light weight and my hair is dryer in 5 minutes less than my last hair dryer!  I'm very happy with my purchase!"
"What a fantastic hair dryer.  It has the cooler setting, but with the same wind power as the high setting so you can get your hair dry and smooth without burning it.  I have owned numerous dryers from Vidal Sassoon and Conair and many other brands, however this is just the best and so well priced.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Andis."
"I really like this hair dryer! Although it's a bit heavy on my hands as I'm using it, it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth with minimal frizz. It also dries my hair efficiently and quickly. Highly recommend it and it's at a great price!!"
Love this dryer.I have very curly hair and this dryer is light and dried my hair faster than most dryers.I am very picky and I highly recommend this dryer.
"I decided to purchase this hair dryer after using it during a recent hotel stay.  I was drawn to the fact that it does not emanate the same high-pitched tone that my prior Conair makes (which is also an 1875 but has added features such as cool air and turbo settings).  I'm very happy with my purchase.  The hair dryer is VERY lightweight, cheap, and hot enough to get the job done.  Most importantly to me, I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when I use it.  I highly recommend it."
This is a great hair dryer.  Easy to use and store.  I don't like cords loose on things and the cord stores in the handle of the dryer with just a press of a button.  We had stayed at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington DC and this was the dryer they have in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much that I looked on Amazon.com and sure enough I found it and bought it (much cheaper than I thought it would be too).  My hair is short and fine but this drys it in half of the time as my old one and gives it lots of volume.
Used once - recently cut hair - Sure to use it again after hot weather ends.
"Dryer works very well for ,me!"
"Love this blow dryer. For those of you who have curly hair and have issues with bigger dyers, this is the one for you!"
Second time buying this item because I wore the first one out. Love it.
My first one lasted 20 years. I ordered this to replace it.
"I usually have to take my full size $$$$ hair dryer on vacation because the ones at hotels are wimpy. I decided to research smaller hair dryers & this one looked great. I just tried it today & to my surprise, I liked it!  It dried just as fast as my full size dryer."
"My Wife Really Likes This Dryer, We Would Like Panasonic Extended Warranty!"
powerful and fast drying
Girlfriend loves it! Not too hot for hwr hair.
Great service. I just wish that I had realized that the barrel is so long. My wife has a short arm  and has difficulty using the dryer.
Received exactly when promised. Product is exactly what I was looking for and met or exceeded expectations.
I love the amount of air it produces and the multiple heat and blow settings!
Works very well and fast. I have medium long wavy hair. It looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product. I am saving a lot by not having to use products in my hair anymore.
Favorite model. No longer available in stores. Bought as backup for 3 year old one currently using.
"Works really well, and fun colors"
Second one I have owned. They are great. Last forever and very sturdy.
"I purchased this hair dryer because it was dual voltage, and I wished to use it in both the United Kingdom and France.  It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  I could not be happier with this purchase.  Turns out we went to Italy too, and with the same French convertor, the dryer worked in Italy too."
This is my second time buying this hair blower. I love it so much!
Love it and use it daily.  So convenient.
"is kind of different to the picture one, but the stylish on my hair it was as expected"
Love it! Small but powerful!
"Bought this to replace a Sunbeam 1500 and was VERY happy to find that the wall mount was compatible!<br />Comparing the 2, the Sunbeam had 3 speeds, of which I only used the upper 2, and the Oster has 2 speeds, the 'upper 2'."
Exactly as described
"Works great.  No complaints.  Fyi: I'm 28 & never owned a hair dryer before so I dont have anything to compare it to.  BTW If you think it this product sucks, it doesn't; it blows."
exact replacement for what my wife has used for years
"Love this quiet, efficient dryer!!"
I love this. My mom got it for me for Christmas and it's definitely one of the best Christmas gifts I've ever gotten. Peopel complained that it didn't have a medium setting but I personally didn't see a need for it. I use it for my hot oil treatments and my deep conditioning treatments it works great. It doesn't burn my neck or ears. I would definitely reccomed
Can I just say that this is my SECOND hair dryer by Remington? I loved my first one so much that I wore it out! (A one to many drops on the floor after a few years)
I love this hairdryer.  I really like the retractable handle and the quietness of the dryer.  My old dryer was much louder.
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
"I'm really satisfied with this purchase, and I totally recommend it"
hot
Received it today...the first thing that i did was blowdry my hair.
The wife says to give this dryer 5 stars. She really likes it!
"We love it, we put it in our RV because an RV that we owned had one and I think that they should be a standard feature in all RV's"
This item is exactly what I replaced. Thank you
This is my favorite hair dryer and it's the third I've owned.
Works really well!
Great dryer.  Fits in a small space.  Very convenient to use.
I love this hair dryer. I bought it 4 years or so ago and just recently bought another one because I am living between 2 cities and wanted one in each of my bathrooms.
Dries your hair really fast!
"This is the only brand I trust. I tried many many hairdryers, and they all stop working as soon as returning is not an option. This hairdryer is the last one you will ever need. It has two settings high/low, and it just works."
Exactly what we were looking for.
Really handy to use. And the pink color makes my day ;)
everything I wanted. I mounted it in my motorhome and I love that I can remove it to take with me if I'm using a public shower. Just what I was looking for.
"Works great! I take it with me for all of my side jobs as a stylist, and it's small and portable enough to go everywhere."
Have lots of hair but the medium heat seems to handle it well. I'm happy with it & hope it last long.
"works perfect for us, not too big and not too small, wife luvs the ease of it on the wall"
This hair dryer will take the abuse of flying 20' through the air and smashing me in the head! Very durable and she likes the retracting cord!
"Dryer is Great for the money, It is quiet gets hot and seems to compare to the Chi dryer we also have in the salon. Thank you so much. the final test will be life span."
"I was hesitant to buy ths hair dryer because its only 1875 watts, i started to buy a 2000 watt dryer, but chose this one instead......I have shoulder length hair and this hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes,  I love the color and also the fact that it has different heat settings and speeds,  so glad I purchased it"
"this is the 3rd one i've owned. i now have 2 (keep one in the guest bathroom). love the settings, how well it dries my hair without frizziness and the variety of settings."
I LOVE THIS BLOW DRYER..IT STRAIGHTENS AND SOFTENS YOUR HAIR INSTANTLY LEAVING IT WITH NO DAMAGE...I USE IT EVERY DAY!
"My wife likes it very much. It's better than the last one she has that got too hot.<br />Thanks,<br />Jim"
This is the only dryer I use. I love the force and power it has. If you want volume this is the way to go
bought it when my other one broke. love it! i recommend everyone to use this product regardless of the hair type you have.
I love that the cord is kept inside the hair dryer.  No more tangled cord. Glad I bought hair dryer.
Works as advertised.  Can't beat the price for a quality product such as this one.  One of the better buys out there.
we purchased these after using in a hotel.<br />great and compact.<br />just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too.
I ordered this hair dryer when my hair dryer stopped working. I received it in just a couple of days. What I love about this dryer is that it is dries and allows me to style my hair so much quicker than my old dryer. And the price is reasonable.
"Fast, doesn't burn, doesn't weaken over time. Love it! My grandmother is a professional hair dresser and she recommended this for personal, at-home use due to a good blend of price and quality."
I had this model blow dryer for over 7 years until I dropped it and broke the fan. This blow dryer took many years of abuse and worked like a champ. I bought the same model to replace the one I had.
"This hair dryer is the one I'm keeping after returning two others to Walmart.  It has three heat settings, and the hot is actually hot.  It's lighter than other dryers too.  It's my favorite because it's significantly quieter than the others I tried."
Unlike some hairdryer's that claim to be quiet and not blast your eardrums...This one is really quiet and has no loud pitch or squeal.  Lightweight and folds up when you need to travel.  Great design on the retractable cord..which once you have this you won't be able to ever buy one without this feature.
"This is a great hair dryer.  Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  It's weight is typical for dryers this size.  The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  I also like the color.  I would buy this brand again."
I love this conditioner.  It lasts long and its a great detangler for African American hair.  I detangle my hair while the conditioner is in it and it and it stays that way once I wash it out!
Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she has been using it on daily basis. I am glad that she loves it.
"Been taking it for a couple of months now, and it's most definitely working for me."
I didn't know what the attachments were for so I threw them out.  I turned it on and it blew hot air.  5 stars.
"The Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic is a wonderful hair dryer.  It is very noticeably quieter than any other hair dryer I have ever had.  Compared to other dryers I have used, it leaves my long straight hair full of body and never adds static electricity.  It is definitley worth the $33.99 I paid for it."
"I originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in Chicago and loved it. So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel. YES!  My daughter and I seem to want to use it at the same time, so I ordered another one so we wouldn't have to fight over it in the mornings. :-) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!"
"I'm an artist and I needed this to help dry my artwork. It works great for that! There's a low setting that I use if I have &#34;puddles&#34; in my watercolors, and a high setting if the painting is just soggy.<br /><br />I really don't use it as a hairdryer, so I couldn't tell you how well that works, haha. But it's super reliable, compact and I have literally never had any problems with it. Maybe the cord could be longer in future designs- I don't think most people will take issue with that though, because typically there is a plugin right next to bathroom sinks in every house. For an artist though, having a longer cord would be handy. That said, I am totally happy with it the way that it is."
"I had recently been on vacation, and the hotel had this hair dryer in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much I decided I wanted one for my bathroom, found it, and purchased it!  I have no regrets.<br /><br />First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  I am always running late, so being able to grab and dry is wonderful.  It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.<br /><br />I know others complain about the nightlight... in the beginning it seemed bright so I would simply pull the bathroom door to.  Now I don't even notice it!<br /><br />If you're looking for something efficient, practical and convenient, this is the little dryer for you!"
"Pro:  lightweight, good power, less frizzies<br />Con:  have to unplug nightlight in bathroom to accommodate the large GFC plug of dryer"
"I ordered thursday night I received Friday night. comparing its price, I really suprised from its quality. It is pleasant to touch its surface and it works very well. I am really oversatisfied. touch wood!! I hope I wont have a trouble in coming days."
I love this hair dryer! It's super quiet and doesn't get too hot on the Medium setting as with many other hair dryers. I highly recommend this one.
"This little hair dryer really does the trick! I will admit for those with a thick head of hair this may not be the best option, but for me, with my long, thin and falling out hair its perfect. It doesn't get SUPER hot which is good because my hair is easily damaged so having a hair dryer that does not scorch my hair is a plus. I have not owned a hair dryer for the last 10 years but I was told that by blow drying my hair it will help natural oils come out that air drying doesn't release and so far I am very happy with the product. It comes with a diffuser and other small attachment as well. I love it!"
"What more can you say about a hairdryer? It's hot when you set it on 'High', and cools quickly when you hold the blue button. It always turns on when you need it to. That's about all I need for a hair dryer, and this does it."
This is the second one I have had.  The old one finally gave up after many years of use.  It is the right size for me and not too many features to confuse me but enough to do the job - and nicely.  I think I'll purchase another one to keep in my RV.
"I read other reviews that said this herstyler pro tourmaline hair dryer was very heavy, one even called it a brick. I don't find it to be very heavy. It did have a strong plastic kind of smell, but it has faded away. I think it was just it being brand new. I also found this price to be amazing compare to retail. Have noticed my hair being more healthy. I stopped using this 4-IN-1 oil stuff because it over does it. It sure beats my old Revlon blowout hairdryer. It also has made straightening my hair easier since this smooths out my hair."
"I had used it once in a hotel.  I like it getting my hair dry as faster as my old one, and a big plus is it didn't sound loudly as my old one.  Yes, it's just as what I want.  Then I rushed online, and ordered it.  It's been 4 months since, it's still working good.  Love it."
"I love this hair dryer! Not only does it dry very well, but it is extremely light-weight and perfect for travel! It's also not too loud, so it doesn't wake my roommate in the morning."
"It was exactly what I thought it would be. It is tremendously quiet and dries on a &#34;medium&#34; setting, the highest temperature option is too hot. When you sit to dry your hair, an office chair won't do. You must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand. I am happy with it."
"I love this blow dryer,because it get the job done,for less the price. I do a lot of natural hair and it smooth out that cuticle allowing me to Flatiron the hair smooth and straight.this it's the second one I bought.  One For Home And One For word. Love it."
"Excellent dryer, light weight and drys hair quickly. Speed and heat can be varied to suit whoever is using it.<br />The only con is the plug does not fit snuggly in the wall outlet, it's a but lose, but that said it stays in! I would definitely buy it again."
Really nice hair dryer.  I love the cold setting and it is not a puny amount of air!  Does a nice job and is easy to use.  Not too clunky or loud.  I like it.
"We liked this so much, we bought another for our daughter's bathroom so we could get ours back! Very quiet and a reasonable value. The wattage is fine because any higher just cooks your hair anyways..!  Time will tell with durability.."
"got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up. It's the most convenient dryer you can own. Didn't even have to replace the wall mount bracket. New unit was exactly the same as the old. But - gotta say I'm really glad we kept the old unit. The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box. The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed. But the screen on the old unit was an exact match. So - snap-off, snap-on, and viola, back in business. Lucky for us. And Amazon. Or they'd have to pay for an exchange. And we'd be stuck using a clunky, 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so. Amazon's delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected. Good price too. Oh, the built in night light is real handy too. Worked great for at least 15 years."
"I have 3B curly hair and the diffuser attachment works amazing, it doesn't make my hair frizzy but provides a lift to my roots. The dryer is super lightweight and is very quite. I keep it on low and the power is still amazing, it cut my hair routine by half. I would highly recommend this to anyone with 3B curly hair."
If you really want to dry your hair quickly then this is the dryer you're looking for. It gets very hot and I LOVE IT! It is good for my hair (I have very thick curly and frizzy).
Cut my drying time in half!! Love it :)
"This is a professional quality dryer and dries my hair more quickly than any other one I've owned, and it does it quietly.  It's also very lightweight and therefore easy on my arms because I blow my hair out every morning.  I told my hair stylist what I bought and she said it should easily last me 5 years.  Great feedback on the seller, too.  My order came quickly and as described. New in box."
"I needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one.  Based on reviews, I ordered the Onei dryer.  It is lightweight, quiet (!) and really can get hot so less drying time.  I am quite pleased with it.  And the seller even sent a follow up email to ensure my satisfaction with the product.  I call that excellent customer satisfaction!!"
"I had the exact dryer prior to purchasing this one.  I had it for many years before it gave out.  I have thick, curly hair and this gets it dry in no time.  Its light weight and easy to hold.  It has 3 different heat settings and high/low setting for air flow.  Very happy with this product."
"It is great to have this --- just like the hotels!  A very nice perk at a very reasonable price!  Extremely convenient!  No longer do I need to leave the house with my wet hair because it is somewhat inconvenient to reach my husband's plug-in for the hair dryer...Usually, I would just say 'forget-about-it'!    Love the product!"
"Can't beat the $10 price! I was looking for a new hair dryer, and this was one of the 3 choices I had. The other one was also Remington ($30), and the third was from another brand for around $60. I'm not a fan of yellow color, so this was one thing keeping me from getting this hair dryer (when I was looking at it, it cost around $20). However, next day the price went to $10, and I didn't have to think much as the specifications were exactly as what I was looking for. After trying the hair dryer, I can only say the best things - it works perfectly!"
"This is a great dryer. As a male, I don't use all the &#34;fancy&#34; options that this hair dryer comes with. I simply use it for 30 seconds after I come out of the shower and it works great. The two selling points that I bought this dryer is because of Amazon Prime and the low price compared to other hair dryers."
Bought for our motor home. Installed easily and works great.  It is small enough to be out of the way yet has the power needed.
I love this blow-dryer!  What a great purchase...you won't be disappointed.  It makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow-dryer and dries fast too.  I highly recommend!
"A top tier home hair dryer.  It has all the features:  More heat, at 1875 watts  ---  Salon quality motor - up to 40% more air flow and three times the service life  ---  Ceramic pearl technology (Ceramics for even heating, and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair)  ---  Ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions  ---  Concentrator and diffuser blower attachments  ---  Three heat settings, two fan speeds, and a cool shot feature.<br /><br />I don't use hair dryers.  My wife does, and when she broke her old Remington T/Studio, she would have nothing but another T/Studio as a replacement.  By the way, this dryer has a 4 year warranty, so keep your receipt.  (In our case, the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt, and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke . . . so I appropriated the old dryer, wired the fan speed to permanent high and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when I need one).<br /><br />Not cheap, but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us.  By the way, the Amazon price was by far the best we could find at the time we bought this replacement."
"It's cheap and it works - what's not to love? Full power is pretty strong and gets my hair dry within minutes. The heat is at a good level, not too hot and not cold. There's also a cool button in case you want cool air for a moment. It's also very light, which makes it easier to use and hold, especially if you have crazy hair like I do. Some people have said it's loud, which is true, but it's not much louder than most other hairdryers. I haven't tried the attachments. Overall, it's a good hairdryer and I would buy it again."
"I just got this hair dryer a few days ago to replace one that randomly stopped working. I love this product so far- it is very sturdy without being too heavy. The cord reel is a great feature and makes storage very easy.     The hair dryer itself works great. Compared to my last one, this dries so fast! The temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being *too* hot, and the cool is actually cool. I hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far!"
"I already own this hair dryer for a year and it is still working fine. It is small, light-weight, does not tire your hand and blows just the right amount of air. I highly recommend it. I first used it at a hotel and then bought one for my personal use. I am glad I did."
"It's a great dryer and is drying my hair faster.  I choose 2600 as I have fine hair and didn't feel I needed the 3200.  The dryer is nice and QUIET, but is a bit heavy not crazy heavy."
"Works great. Exactly what I expected. Love the retractable cord, and it has enough power to dry my hair quickly."
"This is a great little hairdryer!  Nice for traveling, but I use mine everyday.  It dries my hair very fast, and its so lightweight."
I have very thick and frizzy hair.....I love the multiple speeds and the heat settings that it has. I wish it was a little lighter.  I can deal with that though.... I love it ....After I blow dry my hair I barely need to straighten it. Reduces the frizz GREATLY!!! Comes with the two adapters pieces which work great.
"This is a great product.  Although a bit pricey a little goes a long way and I love the way it helps your hair dry faster.  Not sure how it works, but it does.  Although the product says it is oil my hair is never greasy feeling and feels great! I would certainly recommend it for longer hair."
I needed a good hair dryer bad!  I ordered this not really knowing it had a retractable cord.  What an awesome idea!  Just love it.
"My old blow dryer was really bad, so I looked up to read a lot of reviews. This one had quite good reviews, and I'm quite satisfied with this purchase! :)"
"My wife just loves this hair dryer - so convenient - no more hauling the old one out from under the sink, unplugging the nite-lite, etc.  And the nite-lite is great!  Those mid-night visits are safe and lighted - no fumbling around with those other 'soft-lights'."
"This thing is awesome!! Small, compact, powerful. This thing stores well as it folds up, for those of us that have limited bathroom space and cabinets or travel often. Conair has been making quality products for years and they have always been affordable."
"I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn't be more satisfied.  I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I'd pay that price again.  I'm glad I don't have to because now the price has really come down.  This small hairdryer has more air force than all the big clunky ones I've used in the past.  The telephone type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    Excellant product in every category."
"I've owned various blowdryers through the years, but this one is my favorite by far. It's relatively lightweight (though I wouldn't say it's featherweight, but it is quite a bit lighter than most dryers on the market), dries hair faster than any other dryer I've used, and generally creates smoother, shinier results. I love that you can pop-off the back and replace/clean the little air filter, since most of my dryers in the past lost power over time because the filter got clogged with dust and I couldn't clean it.     After my most recent cut my stylist gave me a blowout with this dryer, so I knew it was reliable. The way I see it, I wear my hair every day and it surrounds my face, so it's worth investing in a tool that will give me consistently great results that improve my appearance. I highly recommend this dryer!    And by the way, I purchased it from someone on Amazon who was selling a new one for about a hundred dollars. It was a great value and I've had no problems with it!"
"Lots of power, works great, hair doesn't seem as dry after using.  Would definitely buy again."
My wife like the power and size.  I think it is a bit loud.  Easy to mount and it doesn't take up much space.
"Works great and dries my hair really fast! I have long, medium-thickness hair and this does the trick. Love the different heat settings and how it doesn't just have a cool button, but an actual cool setting. Only thing is I wish this came with a diffuse attachment..."
This is a great value for the price.  It does the trick.  I don't need anything fancy.  It is simple.  I just wanted something to dry my hair.
Love the travel hair dryer. It folds down to take up less place. The diffuser works great with my curly hair and it has hot/cold air options.
"I bought this after my last Conair blow dryer pooped out.<br /><br />Pro: dries quickly, silky, smooth hair<br />Con: none yet"
very good i really like it also used for facial which is amazing. kinda expensive. but worth the money haha
"My old ionic dryer was dying- I liked that this one featured an &#34;on demand&#34; ion option, and other reviewers vouched for its quiet. I am using it now for a few months, and it is really a great dryer.  It is light, balanced, and easy to handle.  I like that you can switch the ion on/off, and that heat/air settings are completely adjustable.  And it really, really is quiet. It does what is says it does, and it is worth the $$.  Also shipped quickly. Makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly."
I have a disability so I can only dry hair one handed.I searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what I was looking for.I stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock.Please put more in stock!I need another one to take with me on vacation!
"After using this blow dryer at a Renaissance Hotel, I was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz.  Another plus, it also dried my medium-textured straight hair very quickly.  The retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold.  The included concentrator does a great job of drying your roots fast.  I loved this blow dryer so much, I bought my daughter one for her college dorm, and she loves it too.  Thank you Andis!"
This is a great product and having it hang on the wall frees up counter space and not more tangled cords!
Nice blower for personal use....it heats well. I have fine and long hair and it took me 25 min to dry all my hair which is a pretty good time consider that a professional dries my hair in 45 min
"I read reviews on this that said the night light was too bright.  I don't agree at all; besides, I would not recommend ever leaving a blow-dryer plugged in all the time.  It's a great little dryer.  No more having to keep in a drawer, taking it out, putting it back, every time I want to use it.  It was a snap to put together and get on the wall."
"I have fine hair (but a lot of it) that is very prone to frizzing.  This dryer really helps keep it straight without frying it.  I was using a chi rocket, and this is much easier for me to use."
This dryer is a great device and works well. It's small and can easily be transported while travelling. It's also powerful and helps to dry hair out.
"This hair dryer has worked wonders. I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and this product creates lovely results. Leaves hair straight with a lovely sheen. Also, it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to dry hair!"
"So far this hair dryer is great. Last year I purchased a conair one similar to this, and it seemed to over heat easily. I like the fact that this one has a low,medium, and high setting. The attachments that came with it are pretty good. I know a lot of people were complaining about the brush being too soft,  and I can see why they say that. Fortunately my hair isn't that thick, so the soft brush works fine for me."
"I am very happy with this hairdryer. It is very powerful. I have a long hair and it usually takes me a lot of time to dry my hair, but with this hairdryer I'm done for 5 min. It is also very light and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product."
Love love love!!! It's quiet.  My hair dries quickly and with more volume than my previous dryer. I can't say anything bad about this product.
"Folds up to just the right size, the retractable cord is convenient, and it works very well without overdrying."
This dryer dries hair fast with various heat options and speed.  The retractable cord is very convenient.  I bought this dryer after I used a similar dryer in a Hampton Inn Hotel and loved it. I am surprised at the complaints about this dryer.  I have used it for a year with no problems and I still love the dryer.
"Cute little hair dryer. My younger daughter wanted her own dryer so I got this one. she loves it and so does my older daughter. Works great, has alot of power for a little thing  pretty color also"
"I've only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far. It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool! The only downside is the cord is like 2 too short when I am trying to blow dry my daughters hair. But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha! I would recommend this dryer!"
"Quiet, very light and long cord, work as promised, cool air wonderful, medium heat is all required...<br />loved the 2 attachments that came with it.<br />came earlier than expected!"
"I purchased this mini hairdryer because I travel a lot, and because I have a small bathroom and I don't like taking up a lot of precious counter space. Plus, is it just me, or have regular-sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years? They're huge and over-sized, in my opinion. I saw that this came with a travel bag (zebra-striped) as well as a diffuser and concentrator attachment. For the price (around $15), I thought this was a great deal. I was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised with it! It works great, and I haven't had any problems with it. The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a 'cool' setting, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.<br /><br />If you travel a lot or if you just don't want a huge hairdryer, this is a great hairdryer."
This hair dryer is EVERYTHING!! I absolutely love it!! I am African American and have very kinky hair. This dryer gets my hair straight and then I only have to run through my hair with the flat iron one time. I also use it for my daughter. She has loose curly hair and it gets her hair silky straight. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!
"works wonderful. gets hot and drys very fast. shipped fast, Would buy another one if I had to. If you need heat to your hair you wont go wrong purchasing this item."
Dryer is very quiet and powerful. Easy to install. Night Light has a nice green glow. Highly recommend this product.
Best blow drier I've ever owned. Light and powerful. The power button is actually 2 buttons side by side. One button controls the heat setting and the other controls the fan speed. I really like this feature because you can set it on low heat and the fan on high.
This little beauty has great heat and blowing capacity.  I love it and use it at home and when traveling.  I like the small size and light weight.  It's amazing that they packed 1600 Watts into this tiny little blower.  You'll love the power it has. I have since bought two for others as gifts.
Product arrived in perfect condition and have had no issues since it arrived.  It was packaged very sustainably and safely. Am very satisfied with customer service.  Totally worth the wait!<br />My girlfriend absolutely loved this as a gift! She said the dryer is powerful enough but not hot enough to damage hair will leaving smooth hair and preventing split ends from fraying from the intense heat of a competitor.  If you have a significant other with delicate hair this is definitely worth the price and wait.  It will pay itself back in no time!<br />I say it's worth the wait because you either have to save up enough money to purchase an item of this caliber and also because it is manufactured in Italy and takes about two weeks to arrive
For about $12 you couldn't go wrong. Arrived quickly and blows hot air....what more could one want? So much better than e-bay!
"Very happy with this dryer as my last one was getting way too hot and frying my hair.  It's not too heavy nor too loud.  All in all, I would recommend this product!!"
"I'm a woman of color with healthy hydrated curly textured hair. It is ESSENTIAL that I have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage. I didnt expect anything from this $13 dryer, but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally. I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED. I've spent HUNDREDS of dollars on T3, CHI Pro, Superstar -- and they all work GREAT. Well, while this isnt  100% comparable, its near 80% comparable. Fantastic quality! This is one of your best bets for a good quality, high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune. I will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when I hit the DC humidity than it does when I use my other blow dryers. But still, a small, minor complaint given that it is less than $20, travels well without taking up space, and gets a decent temperature with good air flow."
Love it. It is very powerful hair dryer. I like it because it also folds up & takes less space
"This replaced a hairdryer that's oh, about 25 years old and still working. Gotta say, it's a welcome change. Love the ionic aspect, and it leaves my hair very manageable. Powerful but quiet motor. Other reviewers have commented that it has a funny smell. I can't say I've noticed, and there's never any reason to blow it in my face, so not a problem. Love the soft feel of the housing, love the little rubber bumper that doesn't allow it to slide on the countertop, love the long cord ... maybe I'll get 25 years out of this one, too!"
"I've had this for a couple years. It's been very good. The cord is a little short. Otherwise, no complaints."
My sister in law is hairdresser and bought me one for my 35th bday. After 10 years of using it every day it finally quit. I have very long and thick hair and this is the best hair dryer since it dries my hair quickly. I went online to Amazon to buy a new one and am thrilled. Would never go back to cheap dryer that hardly works again. You have to go Turbo!! You'll be very happy you did.
"This is a really good hair dryer. Most other models either have low airflow or are very loud and hurt my ears. This one is hot, has high airflow and the sound is soft and easy on my sensitive ears."
"I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side. A great investment."
What you see is what you get. I've been wanting one for a very long time. I am very satisfied with my new hair dyer.
"This dryer is nice and quiet and is very similar to my old Vidal Sasson Quiet Style VS750 dryer.  I like the controls as they are easer to use with the push style versus the slide style of button.  Very happy to have this after trying two other dryers.  The other two were either too loud or to strong.  I have very fine hair and I don't need a hair dryer that can basically blow my head off of my shoulders.  I don't see anywhere on the box that it is by VS but if it is, I am very glad as I had the VS750 for 14 years and hope I have this one for a long time."
"I love this hair dryer!!! It manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way.  Whatever voodoo they are using, I approve whole heartedly.  I like it that my hair feels soft after I use it.  After I dry my hair, I use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair.  It feels so nice, it's making me want to wash my hair right now!"
"This is the second one of this model dryer- revlon travel 1875w I have purchased. I bought this one for my mother because she was dying for it since I got it and it worked so well. I bought mine in 2009 and it is still going strong! I have pretty thick long hair, about chest length, and this dryer is by far the best one I've ever had. I always bought Conair in the past but saw this on sale and decided to get it to travel with. It ended up replacing my full size dryer because it works better than my big Conair, dries my hair super fast (5 minutes or so) and is really light. I dry my hair almost everyday in the winter and only a couple times a week in the summer to give you an idea of how much I use it and it still works like a charm. Revlon for me from now on.<br /><br />Summary- best little hair dryer you will buy. Powerful, light, and great value!"
"I like this hair dryer.  MUCH lighter than my old one and dries hair great.  I like that the concentrator is included.  The intake screen in the back is removable, so I can clear out the dust that collects."
"This is the second one of this model my wife owned.  The blower fan severed off the spindal on the last one we had.  Hopefully, it won't happen again.  Regardless, we were very happy with the price on Amazon.  The items was over $80 dollars in the salon when she bought it about a year ago.  The dryer appears to be very heavy duty and good enough to be used at the hair salons."
So far so good. Powerful. Does make my thin hair look more volumn.
I first bought this because the gym I went to had this hair dryer and I always liked how it dried my hair.  I also figured people use the hair dryers all day long at the gym so they must last.  So when I was in the market for a new hair dryer and decided to buy the same one.  Ive used this everyday for the past 2.5 years and still works great.  The lint catcher is easy to clean out and has good excellent heat and drying power.  When this one someday wears out I will be buying the exact same one again.
"This dryer gets the job done: just want it dry?  It's fast and powerful and you can easily direct it.  It also comes with two attachments, one for straightening, the other for zeroing down on problem areas.  I love the color too - it's bright and cheery."
"This blow dryer is hot and powerful.  Dries my hair super fast, like 2 minutes fast!  This is by far the nicest blow dryer I have ever owned."
"It is a good quality product, I have been using it since 2013 and it is working perfectly. However, I do not blow dry my hair everyday, I only use it occasionally."
Great dryer.... Cut drying time in half! Looks like a professional job!
"This hair dryer performs as expected.  I have dry/damaged hair due to chemo 2 years ago.  I have never owned a hair dryer and thought that maybe blow drying my hair with a diffuser to increase wave/curl would make it look better but it didn't.  However this is not due to the hair dryer.  The hair dryer is light, was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator. I tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate.  Feature I love the most: adjustable heat setting.  I use the warm instead of hot and I can put the fan on low or high depending on how fast I want it.  Great dryer for the price but also for all of the features."
"I was looking for a dryer that was NOT an ion dryer or ceramic, these days that is NOT that easy!!!! I came across this one, had a few good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try....I'm so glad I did! I've had this dryer for a little over 2 years....no problems. I use it every single day with a big diffuser on it. I have naturally curly thin hair and must use a diffuser...this dryer works perfectly for me. At first I didnt think I'd like the smaller size but quickly got over that, now I love it I take it everywhere!  1600 watts is perfect. In fact I love this dryer so much I just bought a second one just in case....!!!! Try it you will not be disappointed!"
This product is exactly what I wanted.  The dryer is just like the ones you find in your hotel room.  It is quick and powerful for drying your hair. Hangs nicely on the wall. I have also used it without it hanging on the wall. Much nicer to use when it is hung on the wall.  If you want a hair dryer that is powerful and small this is the one!
"The entire body of this dryer is a matte, somewhat grippy plastic. Really smart feature.<br /><br />Everything else is fine. Buttons, weight, loudness. No issues at all. It dries hair and doesn't blow out eardrums or melt cartilage.<br /><br />Can't write about the long-term reliability, because I've only had it for a couple of weeks. So far, so good."
"I purchased this for a rental house we have, but used it myself when I installed it. It works great, lots of power, dried my hair quickly - and that's saying something since my hair is usually slow to dry. Installed quickly as well. I thought the cord could be a titch longer but I didn't feel it was so short that I couldn't comfortably stand away from the dryer to be in front of the mirror. Overall, a great product for a great price.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's now been 9 months since I purchased and installed these in our rental home, and they still, after heavy usage, work great. No signs of wear and tear or less power or any problems to report."
"This blow dryer works great for me. I am African American with natural course hair. It has the perfect amount of heat to my hair to straighten just enough so I don't have to use a straightener. But, when I do put heat to my hair after using this blow dryer it lays down so beautifully. I highly recommend this."
"I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight. I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz.. I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800). I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price. I think this hairdryer is great. It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last. My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer. If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first! The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz."
"I blowdry my hair at least 3 times a week and I was using a really, really old, cheap, bulky one to get the job done. This dryer gets the job done a lot better! It's smaller, lighter, more ergonomic if you will, and dries my long, thick hair (not always a good thing!) reasonably quick! Great purchase, as long as it lasts as long as my old ones did :)"
Small light and powerful.  I love this hair dryer.
This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I have longer thick hair and this dryer cuts my hair styling time in half. Light weight and easy to use. The only thing I would change is maybe the location of the switches. I find myself hitting the switches to easily when styling my hair.
Nice velocity and doesn't get too hot.  Cold button a good feature.
Best blow dryer on the market from what I can tell.  The first one of these died on me after 5 years of daily use.  I did not hesitate to buy another one.  My thick hair is lustrous and bouncy.
"I have curly, coarse hair.  This hair dryer allows me to have straight hair and maintain the natural volume in my hair.  I ordered two, just so that I would never be without it!  Love this product!"
"I purchased thi dryer from Amazon based on reviews.  My wife loves it.  It is light and powerful.  A real professional hair dryer.  Subsequently I purchased on for my daughter, who also said she has never had one even close to this.  She said iit makes her hair as when she goes to the beauty parlor.  I plan to purchase one for my other two daughters.  A superior product."
"I had the same hair dryer for about six years, then it gave up.  I really didn't want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket, etc.  So I ordered the same model number and the bracket was still the same!  Yeah!  I was able to change it out myself!"
I love this blow dryer! The first time I used it I couldn't believe how much volume and thickness I had in my usually limp hair! I rarely have to use a curling iron now because my frizzy ends have disappeared. Definitely worth the investment.
It's a great item. It dries SUPER quick! I never have to waste time waiting for nail polish to dry AGAIN! YAY!!!
"THIS BLOW DRYER IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!  MY NIECE ASKED FOR ONE AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AFTER USING MINE.  THERE SIMPLY IS NO BETTER BLOW DRYER OUT THERE, AND I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!!!"
Have had this for a little over a year now.  It is extremely lightweight and feels very good quality.  Plenty of different settings and all of them work well.  Good airflow and it is plenty hot or cool enough.
"I'm a hairstylist. This dryer fit me like a glove. LOVE it. Concentrator attachment is nice and wide, and the dryer is really quiet, not heavy at ALL. Highly recommend."
"Heavy Duty awesome dryer. The cord alone lends itself to the words &#34;heavy duty&#34;. Powerful, light weight, multi-heating options. The best dryer I've ever purchased in my 50+ years, that is when hand held dryers began. I have long hair and it's cut my time in half. I can't say more other than I hope it last me a long time."
"It is wonderful. I have spent a lot more on my other hair dryers and this one is great. It is small, lightweight, and dries my hair in less time. I will recommend it to others and would buy it again."
"Really Like This Dryer My Cousin Has The Same One But Hers iS Silver<br /><br />Now I Don't Have To Go To Her House, Just To Blow Dry My HAir Now LOL ;-)"
"I was little skepital for spending $70 for a hair dryer. I thought there are no difference between $30 dryer and $70 dryer. This hair dryer is very quite, light weight, dry quick and well made. I got it for two weeks now so far so good!"
"Really enjoying this dryer. Works really well for my curly hair. I had a really nice/pricey dryer, similar to this one, for years and when it gave out I bought a dept store $30 dryer. I noticed immediately that my hair was getting frizzy. I used that for several months and then finally decided to break down and shell out the cash for this dryer. So glad that I did.<br /><br />I mostly use it with the curl diffuser on warm heat. I get great curls and less frizz. On occasion I use the directional attachment to straighten my bangs or all of my hair and I love that too. Makes my hair silky smooth.<br /><br />The last time I bathed my dog I used the other nozzle that is supposed to be &#34;quick dry.&#34; That was really amazing. Dried my little dog in no time. I was happy and she seemed to be relieved. I imagine that if you don't need to worry about frizz, this quick dry nozzle would be great if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />I've had this for several weeks and I would recommend it. Hoping this one lasts quite a while!"
I have used this product at three other facilities and it is a value for the cost. Mounts easily and works as detailed.
This is the 2nd one I've bought and the first from Amazon.  I loved the first one and had it for many years.  I paid less with amazon for this one and even though the first one hadn't stopped working it started to smell hot and I didn't want to take a chance.  I will continue to purchase this product as long as it's available.  My hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great.
"I bought this because my boyfriend didn't have one and I'm not used to air drying my hair when I shower at his place. He also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them. I did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest. I thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better! The low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect. It even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean. For the price I paid, it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!"
"I rate the product 4 stars. It dries quickly and cuts down the frizz a bit, but nothing out of this world. However, I just interacted with customer service for a problem, and I was very impressed with how the company handled the situation. The product definitely deserves an extra star for customer service!"
Great power.  I shouldn't have waited so long to purchase it.  Dries hair more quickly than any other dryer - by far!  Worth the extra money.
"I originally purchased this product for sunburn relief and loved it.  It is the one product that not only helped ease the pain and discomfort of sunburn, but you don't have to rub the product into sensitive sunburnt skin.  It absorbs into your skin in seconds!  What a relief!  I also found other uses for it.  In the winter, when dry skin is more prominent, just spray it on and it has the same relieving effect.  Now, I don't even buy hair conditioner - it even works as that!  So for around $9.00 a bottle, you really have 3 products in one!  What a bargain!"
"This is a great dryer for the price. I haven't noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn't very loud.  I appreciate the different heat and speed settings. The barrel is longer than most other dryers I've used but it isn't hard to grip or control. It is boxed nicely and comes with a diffuser attachment. I would recommend this productIf you check out the pictures in other's reviews you'll see they have had luck with smooth, shiny hair. I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I've been using texturing product which also isn't conducive to smooth or shiny hair."
"I purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true. I have long thick hair and it certainly dries my hair a lot quicker than the other dryers. In addition, the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air. I'm very satisfied and highly recommend! This is a good buy..."
"I love the different settings and the drying capability.  I dries very quickly and is great a creating volume.  It is a little heavy, but worth the weight."
"I've been wanting one of these since 1976 when my last one flew off the top of my car while driving down the street and broke into a thousand pieces (I forgot I left it on top of my car), but I thought they were no longer making them.  Lo and behold, I was at a hair salon in New Orleans, and the hairdresser whipped out one of these babies.  I exclaimed how much I missed mine from the 70's, and she informed me &#34;honey, they're still makin these puppies.&#34;  So I am now reunited w/ my beloved yellowbird."
"I don't need any special hair tools that cost $100. I have thick, wavy hair and this works just fine, especially with the diffuser attachment. I love how the cord retracts and the handle folds up - it makes storing it wonderfully easy. I would recommend this to anyone."
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas..... she absolutely loves it!!!  An excellent dryer for alot less money than other top dollar dryers.  Dries fast, and much quieter than other dryers."
My wife loves this new hair dryer.  It blows her old hair dryer away.  She has been very please.  We have not issues with the product at this time.  She uses it most days.
"I absolutely love this blow dryer and the attatchments, I usually buy CHI for my blow dryer but the last one shorted out within a year so I decided on trying Hot Tools and I was in love. Multiple settings so you can dry/style your hair just right and the attachments work great for stying my bangs and straighening with the blow dryer. I would definitely buy Hot Tools and recommend this blow dryer to anyone."
LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.. DRIES MY HAIR FAST AND LEAVES IT SMOOTH W NO NEED TO IRON IT.. LOVE DIFFERENT TEMP SETTINGS AND DEFINATELY WORTH EVERY PENNY.. MY  STYLIST OWNS THIS SAME ONE AND SAID THEY LAST A VERY VERY LONG TIME. LOVE IT..WOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT AGAIN IF I HAD TO.
"I was afraid that this hair dryer would not be top quality because of the price. However, everything about it seems great."
"Great used this for my aunts salon, cheap but works like its an expensive dyer"
Great hair dryer. Been using it for a few months now and no complaints so far.
Love it. Powerful and totally worth the price. Dries my hair in half the time.
I've dried my hair twice with it and it made my hairstyle work easier than with my old hairdryer that is losing it's power.  Happy with the temperatures and heat.
I already own 3 different hair dryers from this brand. Love them and will never go for anything less than that quality.
"I heat style pretty frequently and unfortunately burn out a lot of hair dryers. I haven't invested in a more expensive one and I may not need to. This baby is enduring through my blowouts! The ion technology is fantastic - it leaves my hair soft and smooth! With regular cleaning this has lasted longer than any other one I owned and really is keeping my hair in good shape. It's a great supplemental dryer as well and the coating is easy to grip along with a nice, light weight."
"Being a guy I never saw a need for a hair dryer, but recently I found it gives me a ton of volume (Duh). This is a great buy and the attachment works wonders during styling. Not to mention, if you are a hairy guy, it makes the drying process of the rest of your body a lot easier!"
Lightweight and efficient. This is a good buy on a solid dryer that should last for years.
I like the silky feel this hair dryer gives my hair.  I bought the same kind to replace an old one.
Love this hairdryer so much I have an extra one in my guest bathroom!
It's nice but kind a heavy when u need to blow dry you hair your hand will hurt
"Very well made, and works great. I have really thick hair and it gets the job done in about 5 min."
I love the attachables combs and brush as a Afro American it really straighten your hair
I absolutely love this dryer. It has simplified my hair routine and save on so much time. I would definitely recommend this.
good for the price. came back for the second one.
Best hairdryer ever my only complaint is that mine cracked after a year. But it still works so I guess not a problem.
Good and powerful. I think it is enough for boys and guys to dry their hair within 2 or 3 minutes.
The dryer is quiet and powerful. There are three heat speed settings and one without heat. The dryer has silky-touch surface for smooth handling. We have used Andis hair dryers for years. They are used in upscale hotels.
Have been using the yellow bird dryer for a least 20 years.  It's the best blow dryer on the market bt conair
I have frizzy thick hair and using this product makes it more manageable. Adds shine and softness.. not oily/heavy.. love it.
"I did a LOT of research for a trip to England/Scotland I was using this for. I had no problems at all with this, it was light and compact, perfect to cram into an already full suitcase. PLEASE NOTE- this hairdryer is necessary to have dual voltage (they use other voltage there) BUT you still need an actual wall converter so it will fit into their plugs!! This only allows you to change the voltage so that the normal hair dryer you use in the States won't fry your head or die on you, a wall converter is very cheap (about $8 and can be bought almost anywhere). I used the wall converter for multiple appliances (phone charger, etc.) but you need to check voltage on other appliances as well."
Bought one for our winter home also because its a great space saver and its extremely convenient to have it right at your fingertips.  Very powerful for a little dryer.
"Small, powerful and effective. Strong air flow. Sure, the bearings get a little noisy but doesn't affect the performance."
Not much to say here ... this is a small hair dryer perfect for travel; I wanted it to keep in our RV.  I have a lot of hair and it's completely dry in 4 minutes with this little guy.  Very happy with the purchase.
I have extremely curly hair and this dryer is perfect for me.  It's a little loud but worth it!
"Product arrived as expected and was a bargain price. I just used it for the first time and am very happy with purchase. I kept it on low setting, which was enough for my hair. The cooling button works fast to cool off curls created by your brush. Would highly recommend item."
"We have had this for long long time, my wife uses this almost everyday and still works very good, she dropped the other day, and still works very good."
I bought this hair dryer because I wanted a cooler setting for drying my hair without holding down a cool setting and trying to manipulate the dryer on my hair. This dryer does an amazing job in drying my hair without the damage that hot air does to my hair. Cool air actually makes hair appear shiny and closes the follicles making the hair seem healthier.
Couldn't find the hair dryer with comb in the stores so I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.  The Andis Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer lives up to my expectations. It's everything I hoped to find.  I especially like the high heat setting for drying more quickly yet the fan speed doesn't increase so that it doesn't make styling harder.  I would buy this hair dryer again.  .
"So far, so good!  Much better than my previous Hot Tools that blew up.  It is heavier, but dries my hair faster and with less tangles."
Super light. I have a problem on my wrist And usually have a hard time drying/styling my hair. This blow dryer made my hair work so much easier And painless. The power is great too! I would reccomend it to anyone!
"I have never spent this much on a hair dryer before in my life. But one weak moment I ordered it and I am not sorry one single bit. In this case, you DO get what you pay for. It has a lot of drying power but does not blow your hair to the point it frizzes or feels really dried out. First this threw me because I was used to more hot air blowing out but after I finished using it on my hair for the first time, it was amazing. No over blowing, my hair felt softer and in better condition, and for some reason straighter and more styled. No need to hesitate on buying this. I'll never go back to a cheaper hair dryer again.  If you are still trying to justify spending the money, look at it as saving money on extra conditioner for your hair.  This thing is wonderful."
"I am seriously impressed. Next to laundry, blow drying my hair is my least favorite thing to do.  I was looking for something that would blow dry my hair fast.  I have very fine hair, longer than shoulder length. The first day I used this blow dryer I had it on medium heat and it took 10 minutes. That is how long my old blow dryer took, but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers. The next day I used it, I set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes!  It still looked great, just as healthy!  My hair is always breaking and when I blow dry, normally the damage is very apparent.  With this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny!  I love this blow dryer.  I highly recommended it!!"
"This is a great little hair dryer.  It is the third one I have purchased.  I use it at home as my regular hair dryer due to the light weight yet great power.  I gave one to a family member for their guest bathroom and recently gave one to a friend for her guest bathroom.<br /><br />It is compact and  sturdy, light in weight yet powerful at 1600 watts.  It has a low and a high setting.  It is a very good size to pack for travel, and even has dual voltage.<br /><br />I really like this little hair dryer and recommend it."
I really like this hair dryer because I have naturally curly hair and the diffuser works great. The hair dryer temp settings plus I know if it last as long as my last Conair hair dryer 9 years I will be happy. This is the third Conair hair dryer I have bought
"My favorite blow-dryer! Dries your hair fast (on Turbo setting) with minimal damage.     NOTE: For those with wavy hair, it tended to straighten out my curls a bit, but didn't get rid of frizz so much."
"I ordered this on Amazon from Elephant Deals. I received it quickly. The blower is fantastic. It has a steady, hot flow. It doesn't leave me with flyaways, and I don't have to use a flat iron when I'm done. It is quick and efficient. I highly recommend this blower."
"This little hairdryer is very light, easy to use, with 2 attachments. The controls are easy to use, and there's a button for cooler air so that you can actually set your hair using hot then cold air. I'm very happy with the purchase."
this hairdryer is a super product!  i would recommend this item to everyone! it is light weight and has a strong enough power to take my frizzes away in just a few minutes..
"This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair. I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can't describe the way I do it (I'm not even sure I'm doing it correctly). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off."
I'm in love with this dryer!! My hair usually takes 45 mins to dry and with my new dryer it takes me 30. It is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast. I would totally recommend this to everyone. It's at a good price also.
"Hair gets dry fast! I have long hair, below my shoulders but above waist.  It takes me 35-40 minutes (I have fine textured hair).  The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  One can literally talk on the phone or what TV while under this dryer.  One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  It works just fine!"
Although compact it delivers!  My hair dries pretty quickly.  It does a great job.  I use this one more than my regular size expensive dryer.
"I use this to straighten my hair. I love that it is portable, and I can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair, which takes about an hour to do. It will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything. I have had this for years and use it weekly. I definitely will buy it again if I it ever breaks."
I just LOVE my new Conair hair dryer! Very sturdy feeling and the buttons/controls work smoothly- much better hair dryer than my Revlon 1875 which was awkward and cheaply constructed. I have always preferred the Conair Ion Shine and am glad to have a new Conair at a pricetag of $13 ???<br />Motor does seem quieter than my other hair dryers and the 'cool shot' button is an added bonus.<br />Might just have to get another at this price. :)
"I bought this hair dryer to replace an old Conair 1875 watt one.  The old one was at least 12yrs. old and was still working, but making strange noises so I decided to look for its replacement before it died at an inopportune time!  This dryer is great.  It has a lot more 'wind' power than the old one did but it does not seem to get as hot, which with the power is not an issue...it does not burn my head if I stay in one place too long as the old one did.  The case is easy to hold, the dual controls are different, but better than the one it replaced.  I would recommend this hair dryer without any negative issues.  I did not want to spend a lot of money for an ion dryer and this one is perfect.  It leaves my hair much softer and manageable and does a good job of drying hair fast.  The Amazon statement did not mention 'ion'...but on the box it states it is an 'ion' dryer."
I was looking for a wall mount dryer similar to my sunbeam that I have had for years. This one was similar in size and has a few more features.  The cord storage is wonderful as is the extra wattage. The handle is more comfortable than my old one also. Would definitely buy again.
"I like it very much, for hair drying, it works very well. The two accessories are not so often used anyway."
I have fine black hair and I love this product.  I spritz it on before blow drying.  I can definitely tell the difference when I don't use it.  It adds body and it feels light.  To keep the volume I use Elnett hairspray to finish the look.
"I first used this hair dryer at a hotel I stayed in recently. I liked it so much that I did an online search for it and discovered that Amazon carried it. It has a nice feel in the hand, not too heavy, with a comfortable handle. I really like that it has 3 speeds. It also has a cool blast button, but I don't use that. It is also quite quiet for a hair dryer. One of the best features is the retractable cord. Now I don't have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet. I bought this dryer even though I had recently bought a Revlon that I wasn't crazy about because it was too large and quite loud. Very happy with this! I hope it lasts as long as my Conair that died after 15 or so years."
"LOVE it. Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn't break the bank. Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.<br /><br />A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between &#34;4&#34; and &#34;6,&#34; depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I've used at between 7-10. Not dis'ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.<br /><br />My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press. But that's a personal preference. Maybe you'll like it just the way it is. On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.<br /><br />Either way, I personally love this dryer. Five stars."
Love it! Cuts my drying time in half.
Dries my hair in half the time. Love this dryer!
"The Andis RC-2 hairdryer cuts my drying time in half! I leave the dryer on my dressing table without retracting the cord.  For travel, the cord has retracted with a little bit of help but it is not a problem.  I first used this hairdryer at the Marriott Marquis in NYC and knew then that I had to purchase one!  A great value for the job that it does!!"
I love love LOVE this blowdryer! It not heavy... doesnt create alot of heat to damage the hair... Im African American so its hard to find a dryer that wone FRY my hair... it leaves it feeling light and airy.
"I bought 2 FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 w/ Nano Fuzeion.  One was a gift.  I used mine and it's great!  I have dry frizzy hair and it's the first dryer I've ever owned that made my hair straight, soft and shiny with little effort.  My daughter thought I used a straightener. I highly recommend it - it's well worth the cost!"
"Definitely worth the money. I have been using this for a couple of months and have had no problems with. Was nervous the first time I washed it in the washing machine, but it came out like new."
"This little baby is awesome! I got it primarily to take with me when I travel, but now I use it at home instead of my regular hair dryer. It gets really hot (but not so hot that it has singed my hair or anything), and it has a lot of power for such a small blow dryer. Very lightweight too. Love it!"
Took this dryer on my cruise and it works very well on my long<br />blond hair.<br />It is compact and fits right in my suitcase or overnight bag withouth taking<br />too much space.
I use this every day and they are the best hair dryer wall mount you are ever going to buy. Quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up and you are off and running. Anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror. I am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall.
"I have long wavy/curly hair and I've never owned a hair dryer. I always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that I almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times. I did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible. So instead of doing something drastic I decided to give blow drying a chance. I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I've only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It's a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I've never owned a hair dryer so maybe they're normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!<br /><br />And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I'll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I'm just so happy. It's like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days. Sometimes I'll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then I'm good to go!<br /><br />I've never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when I do I'll review that. But for now I'm loving my curls!!"
"Ok, so we all know that we can't pack a lot of heavy things.<br />This little dryer will save a lot of pounds and it works great."
I have owned an Andis hair dryer before and loved it- I had to leave it when I sold my home.  I quickly ordered a new one for my present home (a slightly upgraded version) and am extremely pleased.  It is very quiet and the nightlight is very useful during the night.  I would highly recommend this dryer.
"This dries my hair so much faster than my old hair dryer. It gets hot enough but not to hot and I love that you can change the temp settings on it. The cool blast button also works very good. The cord is long enough and it is not to loud. Doesn't seem to dry my hair out and make it frizzy at all either. Would definitely buy again, very pleased."
"Shipped and arrived within estimated time.  My husband installed it the same day and found installation very easy.  I do have to agree with others that the night light is quite bright.  I do partially close the door to our Master bath because of the light, since our bathroom is connected to our bedroom.  No complaints about using the hair dryer.  It is certainly quieter than our other one.  Would definitely purchase another."
"This hair dryer is identical to the one used by my stylist - and I paid the exact same price he did. I have some natural wave to my hair and while the dryer doesn't straighten every hair on my head, it does a better job than a regular dryer does. My hair tends to retain water, but I would say drying time is less than five minutes with this dryer (my hair is shoulder length). At my last cut, my stylist remarked that my hair is in good condition  - about a month after I'd been using the dryer. The dryer does get hot, but not to the degree my other dryers have. Granted, I don't have a warranty with it, but I'm very happy with this appliance."
I have natural 4c hair. My hair is very thick and coarse. This dryer is the best ever. It straightens my hair quickly and very nicely. You cannot go wrong with this dryer. I love it.
This small Conair 1875 will always be my favorite hair dryer. It is compact and easy to handle. I hope they never quit making this model.
"I love everything about this hairdryer - it is smaller, quieter, hangs on the wall and I just plain LOVE IT!"
"Excellent product, and dries my long thick hair very fast."
"Fabulous little blow dryer. Small, compact, great for packing and travel but still has plenty of power to get the job done quickly.  Worth the money, seems sturdy like it will go the distance!"
"This is for all you Dog Bathers. I wanted a dryer that would  match  some of the over-priced professional pet dryers.  This is perfect. It  blows very fast or slow. It's also very lightweight. On cool and warm it's not  too hot.  And it's very quiet compared to  all of the dryers I've ever used. So if you're looking for a dryer for your dog or cat, you won't be  disappointed. And if you happen to  need it for you're own hair it's just fine."
"I battled with myself over spending this much on a hairdryer, and I'm so glad that I did. Twice I have used it to blow out my hair and my thin, fine hair looks amazing with little need for touch ups with a straightener, NO fly aways.  When I decided to try the diffuser and wear my hair curly, I was hesitant because my Conair would leave my hair super frizzy.  Not with the T3, I had beautiful curls, frizz-free.  Don't let the lighter air flow throw you, this little baby has lots of drying power.  Great size, lightweight, and the velcro cord keeper is helpful when ready to put away."
first the price is really good. I've used it frequently several months and it works well. a little loud but just as most dryers
"I am a hairstylist, and I love this dryer! It is lightweight, and it dries my hair incredibly fast. The cord is a little short for professional use, but I love it for myself!"
"Extremely lightweight yet dries hair in record time, leaving it with a wonderful shine.  Also much quieter than my previous blowdryer, which is an added bonus."
"Plenty of power. Plenty of heat. Like the night light, but would like to be able to switch it off if I wanted ... but can't do that. If I kept this near my ears for a long time, the noise would be an issue, but since I don't, it isn't. Just a nice little device."
I absolutely LOVE this blowdryer. It makes my hair so shiny and nice. It also blowdries it in less than 10 minutes (and I have pretty long hair) I have already had 3 friends test this out and buy it.
"This simple, inexpensive little gadget was perfect for travel.<br />It did precisely what it was supposed to, despite some of the<br />troublesome negative reviews.  It stuck fast to several mirrors<br />over the course of my trip and enabled me to style my hair<br />easily.  I used a fairly lightweight travel-sized blower (Baby Liss)<br />which it supported with ease."
"I love love love this color.<br />When i put it on it's like Christmas on my fingers. It's a dark red with red very thin glitter, a perfect match to Dorothy's shoes!<br />Application was great, you only need two coats. I was nicely surprised by the wear and tear, after 5 days I hardly had any tear.<br />It really is a fabulous color than you can wear on your hands or toes, summer or winter and that I think is safe for work. It's sophisticated with a little surprise.<br />I highly recommend!"
"I got this as a second hair-dryer for traveling and to leave at my boyfriend's house so I didn't have to lug my Conair 213X Infiniti Pro (about $40, and much heavier than this one) back and forth every weekend.  This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.  Either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if I'm destroying my hair!  All-in-all its a great value for the price."
I love the item. It has become very much easier to dry my dreds. Thank you!
"Small but powerful. Dual voltage, great for travel, easy to pack. Very light, so much easierr to work with, than the larger, heavy ones."
"LOVE THIS! I have 4c hair with a tendency to shrink almost 75%! This gets the job done! I also use this on my three daughters' hair, we all have 4a-4c with high shrinkage, and this is one tough dryer! The attachments hold on for dear life and still have not broken!"
"This is one of my best purchases of the year thus far. I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn't think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon. Right away I bought one for my mother [per her request] and we can gladly say we have never looked back!"
This dryer is exactly what I wanted very lightweight and does the job
Already had one. Bought this 2nd one for the other bathroom. Great product.
A must have for any girl! It really has revolutionized hair dryers and I gotta admit I have owned a ton! The drying time is crazy fast! Truly one of my best purchases I have made on amazon! <br />THANKS AMAZON!
"As advertised, works great MUCH faster than my precious dryer. The buttons on the handle are a bit awkward but I'll get used to it."
I love this dryer. It dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer. It leaves my hair soft  and shiny.
Much stronger then I expected great for my tween daughter starting to want to do the grown up girl stuff or for me to borrow for a trip
"As a hairstylist I have used MANY drying tools and NOTHING compares to this dryer.  I will never use another the famous CHI including.  CHI doesn't come close to this one!!!! And the cost you just can't beat it.  I had ,my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly, It hasn't completely quit on me yet but showing signs of getting tired so I'm buying another because I will NOT work without this dryer.  It will not disappoint....HINT  NOTHING manages frizz except products.  So don't think a dryer is going to eliminate frizz because that's nonsense."
has different settings for temperature and power. works great so far and comes with the extra parts (which i haven't yet used).
bought this for my mom after i used her old one and decided it sucked big time. she said she likes it and uses it everyday. i have yet to use it but she was happy!
"i love this hairdryer, im no professional but it does the job and its affordable. I would recommend it to anyone."
I bought this as a gift for my sister in law for christmas.. she hasent opened it yet so not sure how good it is yet.
"It works fast, quietly and better than much higher priced hair dryers. I love the shine it leaves with minimal effort and time."
All I need is a basic hair dryer with several heat settings.  This one suits my needs perfectly.  Reasonable price for a good product.
"For $19.99 this is one of the best buys out there.  Wall mounted the cord and dryer are out of the way and off the counter.  Only 1600 watts but dries better then our bigger old one.  Small, compact and you can take it with you when traveling."
"i love it, it gets the job done.  it was inexpensive and jsut as powerful as my other hair dryers.  i recommend it for anyone."
"This is the only hairdryer I've ever seen that has a cool blower setting as well as a cool shot button. I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.<br /><br />I've had it almost 4 years now and it's still trouble-free."
Great product and price. Strong airflow and nice setting options. Get's my very long hair dry fast. Replaced older model that I had had for over 5 years. Hope this one last as long
"Excellent. It's very easy to put together, it's not too loud actually I'm watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now! The bell is not too loud when the timer is done. The only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking but I'm used to that from going to the beauty salon it goes unnoticeable. Delivery was quick and swiftly and customer service was excellent. My hair dried very quick and I didn't even put it on the max heat. I'm African American with shoulder length hair 4c and I never had a perm. I'm glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price"
"Inexpensive product that made my hair very smooth for flat ironing, I highly recommend, loved it.  I am going to order it again.  If you order, buy two, it's not very big and you certainly don't want to run out since you will be instantly hooked."
"My wife and I got this to replace the same hair dryer we had used for years.  The old one started making a noise that sounded like lint was getting into the fan blower chamber.  In an attempt to clean it, I broke it... I know, smooth move!!  Long story short is that we were amazed to find the exact same dryer on Amazon for $13, so we snagged it.  Great dryer for the price and my wife and are are happy that we have a new hairdryer that we know will last a long time (as long as I stay away from disassembling it).  FYI, the sound the old one was making was no big deal.  I just felt handy for an hour and I broke it."
"This hair dryer worked perfectly on my recent trip to Holland, Belgium, France, and England.  There was no converter needed, just an outlet adapter when switched on the 250 V mode and used only on the low setting.  To clarify, you can ONLY use it on the LOW setting, however on the low setting it runs like it is on high - very easy, and worked perfectly.  It is also extremely compact for easy packing, but still worked like a bigger, nice hair dryer.  Hope this helps someone :)"
"I've been using this for a few months now and I..... love it ^_^ ! Its does a great job, I always use the cool setting and you know what it stays cool. Unlike other dryers that you have to keep holding a button, this one has a low temp setting that remain moderately temperature. The burst of cool air button gets even cooler. Thats what I really like about this dryer along with the slim design is very cool. Okay enough with the &#34;cool&#34; XD Its a great product, you won't be disappointed."
"I ordered this product and it took 10 days before I received it. I live in Seattle and it was shipping from Florida, that's probably why it seemed like forever waiting but I have no regrets...This hooded dryer is just amazing, I wonder what took me so long! My husband put it together as soon as I received and he did it so fast so am guessing assembling is easy ( I was not there when he did it), I was washing my hair ready to try it out. . The results? Simply beautiful soft hair with curls from my rollers...I'm excited at finally being able to do it myself and achieving salon results. You can move it around the house and you don't need a special chair. I used the middle, yellow settings and it dried my hair okay. The dryer is really quiet  unlike some that are so loud. I would highly recommend it."
We had an Oster wall dryer for 10 years and it finally died.  This new one fit our old Oster wall plate for easy installation.  Power cord can be fitted to correct length so you won't have any excess cord laying around.  Dryer is strong and not extremely noisy
"Amazingly quick-drying for such a small appliance.  Takes up such little space.  I love, love, love this hair dryer!"
"This is the best hair dryer.  It is my second one.  I had the first one for years and when it finally broke, I tried a few other blow dryers but returned them all and went right back to the Conair 1875.  The cord keeper is a great feature for me, since I keep the dyer in a drawer.  It stays in there compactly."
"I LOVE this blow dryer. Several years ago my old professional blow dryer died, and I ended up replacing it with the best that Walmart could provide. It seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles (3 heat settings, cool button, 3 air speeds with ion, ceramic heat), but my hair just wasn't getting dry. By the time my hair dried my scalp was soaked, and my hair was was still frizzy no matter how much anti-frizz hair product I used. I have what a hair professional termed textured hair. It's thick, porous, dries slowly because it retains moisture, and tends to frizz.     This blow dryer dries my hair fast, straight, and my hair feels great. It takes half the time to actually get my hair dry now, and my scalp isn't soaked afterwards. This blow dryer gives me the same results as my salon visits. Big revelation....not all blow dryers are alike.    This blow dryer is an investment, but thanks to the great reviews I was confident in giving it a try, and I'm so glad I did. It's worth every penny in time savings, and I like my hair again, and I actually have a hair style."
This is the second time I've purchased this hair dryer as I loved the first one so much.  It gets hot enough to straighten as it dries.  Would recommend highly.
I place my order on Wednesday September 1st and I was shocked that I already got it today September 4th; I am very pleased with them because I need it the item right away and I got it without paying extra money for rush delivery.  I won't think twice to buy again from them and I Would definately recomend them to everybody.  Excellent Packing and professionally well done.   TWO THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS.
"Love this hair dryer.  Had an older one for years, it finally died so I replaced it with this newer version."
This one dries so much more quickly than my previous hair dryer and seems to provide a smoother finish.  Recommended.
"The pictures/description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted. I mounted it on the wall with screws (I found a wall stud for one screw location) and it is excellent.<br />Don't mount it vertically. You should mount it, with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular. This way, your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis - so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc..<br /><br />It is unfortunate, that this product is currently unavailable. I hope the seller would notice this review and offer more.. I know I will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms, as soon as they become available."
"I've been using this hand cream for years and I've tried others, but this is still my favorite.  The bottle is a convenient size--I keep one in my desk at work, one in my purse, etc.  The lotion itself does wonders on my hands and is not greasy at all; rather, it's thick and absorbs relatively quickly.  Additionally, I'm sensitive to products with added scents, so I love that it really is fragrance-free."
"I like it! I didn't review it for a couple months to see if it died early, but no, it's going strong. Way loud, but really strong and I love how it folds up and fits into a little bag for my gym bag. Me likey!"
Great price and it works great too.  Keeps bathroom neat and counter clear. It has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others. I really like the three speeds . I'm going to order another for our other bathroom.
"This hairdryer is light yet powerful.  My first one lasted over 15 years, I'm hoping this one lasts as long or longer!"
I recently bought this Onei Mk-l Air Ionque Hair Dryer and it's the best ever!  It arrived so fast to my door and I use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast and my hair is not dried out like my other hair dryer..  My hair actualy feels like silk..very smooth...  I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!<br /><br />Thank you..<br />Linda<br />RI
"I first used this hairdryer at a hotel. It is definitely one of the best hairdryers I have ever owned. It is small and compact, and folds nicely. It also has a retractable cord, which is a huge bonus. As far as drying goes, this dryer did a great job on my hair. I have thick, coarse hair that is about shoulder-length. The airflow is excellent, and this dryer shaved at least five minutes off my normal drying time. It is also surprisingly quiet (as quiet as a hairdryer can be), even on the high speed. I highly recommend."
"This is the BEST blow dryer I have ever used.  It is extremely light weight and my thick hair is blow dried very quickly without my arm getting tired and sore.  My hair looks amazing too, shiny ans smooth.  In the past, I often didn't dry all the way because it took too long, but now my hair looks great everyday because it works so effectively by drying so fast.  I love this hair dryer.  Definately worth the money."
I originally bought this for my guest bathroom but decided to put in the master and I am so glad I did. I don't have to get the dryer out everyday to dry my hair. It's right there and the night light feature is great also. My hair isn't thick so the blow power isn't an issue with me but it really blows and drys my hair in no time. I'm thinking about getting another one for our guest bath and for a Christmas gift.
this is just the right size and weight. I have a lot of trouble with my wrist and this dryer handles so nice. Also it does not take up much space at all.
"The product was exactly what we expected; excellent.  The arrangement for receiving the product was much more difficult as amazon.com would not ship this product, only available in the US, to Canada."
"This is a great hair dryer - very professional results, several heat and speed settings.  Really worth the amount spent.  Thank you!"
My previous yellow bird lasted over 12 years.  Great for curly stubborn hair.  A real workhorse!  Product was delivered within 2 days.
Works very well not as hot or noisy as most. It takes longer to dry hair.
"This is the second one I have purchased and will continue to buy product as long as they make it.  Love that it hangs on the wall, the shape of it makes it easy to hold."
"Good, dry fast, except for the size! It is too big to take it on travel~ it can't be folded."
"Got this hair dryer after my Hot tools pink zebra one broke. While it's not as cute it does dry my hair better. I am loving how light weight it is, I have long hair and sometimes my arm gets tired from being up in the air that long. But this blow dryer is very light weight and packs a punch too! It dries my hair pretty fast and cuts out some of the frizz with the ions. Overall I love it!"
"Installed this a few months ago.  Super convenient and looks good too.  I love the night light feature as much as the hair dryer itself.  Power is good with 2 watt settings.  Iconic dryer does dry hair faster.  It was a little hard to get to the tiny screws in the back to get to the faceplate to attach to the wall, but it is sturdy.  I love the design and function.  I want to put one of these in the guest bathroom too."
"After much heavy use by two people daily, my original Remington Ac2015 finally bit the dust.  It lasted a good long time.  I loved it so much I ordered the same one as a replacement.  I didn't even see what else was out there, which I never do - I'm the research queen!  I figured why look for something else when this one has everything.  It's quiet, has perfect temperatures and it dries fast.  Leaves my hair silky and shiny. It is a bit heavier than some but you get used to it quickly.  Feels solid and has a nice no slip texture plus an extra long cord.  Highly recommended."
"This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!<br /><br />To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.<br /><br />I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).<br /><br />The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.<br /><br />Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.<br /><br />The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.<br /><br />In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.<br /><br />Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that."
My old hair dryer was a Conair 1875 that I purchased about 10 yrs ago and still works but started to make noises. So I figured it was time to look for a new hair dryer. I purchased this Conair 22NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875 and it is even better than my old one. It's light and comfortable to hold while styling and drying my hair. It dries my hair in 1/2 the time of my old one and my hair looks a lot better. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who is looking for a new hair dryer. It's a great product and you won't be disappointed.
"This hair dryer is amazing.  Just like the one they use in my salon, and it costs so much less!  This is my second one as I loved my first one so much, when it died I bought the same thing!"
"Quiet and fairly light. dries nicely without scorching. The pink hue on the buttons and filter housing was a surprise, as it didn't really show up in the photo, but , hey, it's just a hair dryer."
"I have re-ordered this product because it is Light-weight, powerful, reasonably priced and my wife wanted one. I highly recommend this product."
This is a good styling tool to give a pre-teen who wants their own.  Just one button for low and high and it dries hair really good.  There is also the button in the back for a shot of cold air.
The perfect dryer for travelers.  I owned a earlier version of this compact dryer from the mid 90s until 2013.  Used it everyday.  Extremely powerful for its size.  Would still be running if I hadn't plugged it into 220 volt outlet in Europe before flipping the switch from 110 to 220 volts.
Product is light and powerful.  It is also very quiet.  This is a huge improvement over my last hair dryer
"Great lightweight dryer. Dries hair fast and is so quiet you can actually hear your client talking to you, even in a busy salon."
"I bought this to take on Spring Break and it was great! It was very humid in Cancun and it dried my hair very fast. I have shoulder length hair and it dried it in about 3 minutes. It is great that it folds up, it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer. The cord retracts correctly MOST of the time, but can be pushed in manually. I keep this dryer in my bathroom and my gigantic, expensive one in my bedroom, I much prefer this one!"
I purchased this hairdryer by a recommendation from my hair stylist.  He suggested it would work perfectly for my naturally curly hair when I decide to blow it out straight.  This dryer works extremely well and helps cut down the drying time without frying my hair.  It's definitely worth the money.
I bought this hairdryer after reading the reviews. I was going to buy a more expensive one but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try. It was worth it! It works better than a more expensive one I had prior to this one. It dries my hair very quickly and gives it a nice full body look. I highly recommend this hair dryer- for the price you can't beat it.
"Great little dryer, especially for the price.  We boondock in our motorhome all the time and don't always want to turn on the generator ti dry my hair.  This little unit has much better deying power than I expected.  Very happy camper!"
I recently bought the HSI flat iron.  I liked it so much I bought the dryer.  I like the dryer just a much.  It is light weight and powerful.  I have long wavy hair and this dryer works quickly without adding frizz.
"This is a replacement wall mounted hair dryer.  I had one exactly like it that I mounted in my bathroom 13 years ago when we moved into our new home.  It is extremely handy and up out of the way.  I never have to deal with tangly cords or plugging it in.  It's powerful and efficient.  If it weren't awesome, I wouldn't have bought my second one.  You won't be disappointed."
"This is a great hair dryer. It is quiet and has a powerful fan blower.  It has 3 settings each for heat and blower speed.<br />There is also an instant cool button to cool down the air no matter what heat setting it is on.  It has a long cord which<br />is nice.  It is a litlle larger in size than some and somewhat heavier. However, the heat and blower features and quietness<br />more than offset this."
"Awesome hair dryer.  Definitely professional quality.  It takes less time to dry my hair now.  Also, I love how long the cord is."
"I use it to dry my hair 2x faster than with my old dryer, a lot of volume. love it!"
"Not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer, and it's light, it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that I've never had, and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks. Best $130 I've spent in a long time, and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts, that's for sure."
"No problems or criticisms whatsoever.<br />But I'm a guy, so my standards may be lower. :-)<br /><br />Not as strong-forced a &#34;wind&#34; as my previous 20-year-old blow dryer generated, but it still dries my thinning hair rapidly, and is not as noisy as my old dryer.  It feels solid (not cheap) to handle, and has a nice gold color in person.  It's good that there are three comb/brush attachments, as I know they tend to break over the years.<br /><br />--Happy customer"
It dries all this hair really fast.  Very light.  Bigger than I thought due to it's weight but it works.  Love it.
"I love conair products. I never had any issue with Conair Products in past and I will keep on buying it in future. I bought this one for my mom because of its size. Its small, light and folds inside which is good for travelling purpose. My mom loved the size and color. The noise from the dryer is not loud."
Love this hairdryer it is one of the best hairdryers I have ever used in my life!  I ordered this for a friend who had one already but I should have kept it for myself as a back up incase my ever died but I had it for about 3 years now and nothing went wrong yet!
A powerful hair dryer that is not heavy and is quiet! Gets my hair nice and smooth if I blow dry it straight. Also love that it came with a diffuser for when I want to dry my hair curly.
I have had this hair dryer for several months now and am very satisfied.  I purchased this model as my daughter has used the same (former model) for years.  I highly recommend this purchase :)
"I wasn't expecting too much from the price but I definitely got my money's worth. I had an old dryer and this was much lighter and more quiet. It also has dried my hair faster, even on the low heat setting. Love the rubberized exterior which makes handling easier. Great purchase and would recommend it to a friend."
"The dryer was easy to assemble. Gets hot very quickly, and the cord is long enough for me to move around with ease. Sometimes it does feel a little bit top heavy, but overall it's a great dryer!"
"I really like this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly & thoroughly, even though just a little heavy. Excellent product & highly recommended"
Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer is nicely balanced for wrist and arm movement to personally dry quickly long hair.  I wash and dry every other day and so far it seems gentle (along with good hair health product).  It reminds me of eighties hand held hair dryers only feels and sounds better than mine ever did before.  Also the color blends nicely with medium-wood rustic style.
"This is a super dryer.  It is very powerful for the small size and low price.  It worked just fine in Ireland, Wales, and England.  At home I use it to dry my dogs.<br /><br />Update July 2013:<br />My review was not for this ProVersa Dryer.<br />I bought a dryer in Summer 2011 but it said First Class on it.  I've seen First Class dryers in hotels so I decided to buy it because it must be dependable.<br />I can't review this dryer honestly as Amazon has perversed my review of the First Class Dryer by playing switcheroo with ProVersa.  I call BS."
I have bought this same or very similar dryer for each of my last three houses. I love them mounted right next to the bathroom sink. It works well and for the money I think they are of pretty good quality.
looks exactly as in photo. light weight and works like a charm. would definitely recommend
Great blow dry . shiny hair and fast blow dry
Shipment was received in short time.<br />Hair dryers are easy to installed
"i had a &#34;professional&#34; hair dryer and it broke, i picked this one based on the reviews and the price and i love it. it takes me 15 min to dry my medium hair and it doesnt cause a lot of frizz."
Love this product. Nifty compact is a plus. Can be taken anywhere. Use to steam or dry hair.
Enough power and easy to pack/carry.
I had one of these for ... 7? 8? years and it finally died. As in sparks flew out of it!! I ordered a newer version of the same dryer. Very pleased with it. Saw no reason to change.
I purchased this because I travel abroad quite a bit and needed a reliable hair dryer. I took this and all of my friends took theirs. Mine was the only one left standing. The dual wattage allows me to use this in America and also when I go places. I am very pleased with this product.
The bonnet hair dryer is fabulous.  It's so lightweight.  I can dry my curls and read a book in ease. Absolutely love it.
Fast drying with lots of shine - I was first introduced to this hair dryer at a 5-star hotel I stayed at - it dries hair fast with lots of shine.
Easy to install and use. Did whish they came in diferent colors.Would reccomend to use in any bathroom. I think I might get one for my shop. to heat materials prior to gluing.<br />Skip Kempf
"My daughter has this dryer and it worked so well I wanted one! Fast, fast, fast, and I have a lot of hair!"
"Great Hairdryer with Twin Fans. Does make a scary screeching sound if the power drops. The Hair Dryer is not red, it is pink. also it does NOT have Ionic drying which is a good thing in my case."
This unit performs well and was easy to install.  We especially like the magnet &#34;latch&#34; which holds the dryer into the wall mount.  There are no plastic latch parts to break and you don't have to push the dryer into the mount to lock it into place.
"I like the price, the compactness of it --  and it is easy to travel with.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends."
I read numerous reviews on hair dryers and picked this one. It's easy to hold because of the rubberized grip. Excellent selection of heat and speed settings which are simple to control on the handle. I have fairly straight hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. Hopefully it will last several years.
"Arrived on time.  Nice, powerful small travel hair dryer."
"Excellent and very durable hairdryer. This is a heavy quality dryer; no cheap light-weight plastic here. Comes with 2 attachments. Would be nice if it came with a retractable cord, but money well spent nonetheless."
The wind is strong enough~
I always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where I know they will have a blow dryer.  I decided to try this dryer and it really works.  It is so lightweight and I can't believe it can even dry my hair.  I only take it with me now.
"It is easy to use. My sister had the same brand hair dryer well the same just different color. I would never learn how to blow out my hair in a million years, it'll be three times as puffy and frizzy after I'm done with it. After using this product with the comb i instantly fell for it. Thanks to my sis and ofourse Andis hair dryer I love and an finally manage my hair, most importantly I save a lot of time getting ready in the morning. I guess its great quality for its price. I would recommend it. Actually I did and my cousin bought the same one after using mines."
"Simply put. Youngest daughter wouldn't stop. tried everything. 2 days!!!! it's tastes horrid, and doesn't go away equals strong incentive not to put your thumb in there."
"I bought this hairdryer to use while vacationing in Europe.  It worked great!  It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  Also, I only took a small carry-on suitcase to Europe.  Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  I would highly recommend this product!"
I am so happy with this purchase!! It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I'm shocked!!! and happy!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight.
Very powerful dryer and in Europe I only needed to use it on the low because it dried as if it was on high.  I still use it at home and here I use the high setting.  Great Dryer!!
Love the small size and the way that it dries my hair.  Great little hair dryer.
It's a great little hair dryer. Small footprint on wall & dries hair efficiently. What more could you ask for.
This hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for.  It looks great in our bathroom and I like the way the cord stays on the hook.  No more getting the cord caught in the drawer!  The night light is a soft green and just the right amount of light in the bathroom at night to see where you are going.
"I love this hair drywr.  At 1600 watts it dries my hair rapidly.  It's compact size makes it lighter and easier to handle than those bulky dryers that must be held foot away from the head.  This is a real plus for folks with arthritis in the shoulder or neck joints. It fits easily into a drawer in the bathroom and it doesn't take up much room in a suitcase for travel.  This is my second hair dryer of this type..  The first one was purchased several years ago, and it still works perfectly even after 4-5 years of nearly daily use.  This unit was purchased as a replacement for a similar 1200 watt dryer (different brand) that I kept in my swimming bag but that finally stopped working after 30 years."
"We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon. Various wind speed.  The air is never too hot. The wind is never too powerful. It dries your hair quickly.  Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel.  I paid $20 out the door with Amazon Prime. It's better than dryers that are much more expensive.  Now we'll just have to see how long they last."
This medium size dryer is great.  It dries my medium length hair so fast it's a real time saver.  It's rather quiet compared to all of the other dryers I've owned.
"Other than the pink trim [looks silver in photo], excellent dryer. Solid feel and powerful."
I really like this hair dryer not only because it is designed for travel but that it has better air flow than any other hair dryer my wife has bought. These things are disposable and at this price that makes that part more than acceptable.
"I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone, it is light weight and dries my hair very quickly.<br />It does not burn my hair like the old hair dryers."
"I came from other contry. Our contry use only 220 voltage. When I come back to my contry, I want to use this hair dryer. And when I travel abroad, this will be very helpful. Good product!! Buy it!"
"I recently purchased this hairdryer after my previous one started to sound like a dying cat and was extremely hot to touch after use.  After a week and a half I love this new one!!!  I greatly enjoy that I can dry my hair on cool and high, with the temperature choices of cool, med and hot, as well as low and high speed settings, and cool shot to set.  It's light weight and efficient - I'd buy it again easily."
"I love this brand and model of hairdryer. I had a blue one exactly like this for about 5 years, and it was the most durable hairdryer I've ever had. I would say this one was not as hot as my last, but still a very decent hairdryer. I would definitely recommend!"
"I've only had this for about a week but I'm pretty impressed so far.  I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.  I don't know how long this guy will last and I can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned, but it's functionality is fantastic for the price.  Would definitely recommend this."
Love this hairdryer. Had another one I bought ten years ago that finally gave out. Immediately purchased this and hung it right up. Gives the luxury of a hotel right in my bathroom
"My wife used this brand she saw at Disney while on vacation last year, she liked it enough that she decided she wanted one like it. After searching Amazon I was surprised to find it and order one. Works well and wife is happy. Seems to have a stronger air output than more expensive brands."
"I like the pigment in this colour.  I like bascially all of the NYX colours, and they have a large variety to choose from."
Exactly what I wanted. Great price. Retracting cord a little hard to get use to. Don't retract it most of the time.
"Reckon I have had this about a year now, at least 7 months. Works great, I use it 5 days a week, blows hot air, doesnt overheat, isnt to big, came quick, didnt cost much. Get you one, you will like it."
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.... MY HAIR LOOKS GREAT AND DRYS IN HALF THE TIME OF MY OLD DRYER WHICH WAS OVER 15 YEARS OLD. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I HAD BEEN MISSING BY NOT HAVING A TOURMALINE CERAMIC DRYER
Pretty good for people trying to keep their hair natural without adding chemicals. Very quick and has different settings to get hair dried well.
"I love this little hairdryer.....travels well, small, and lightweight.  It is powerful enough for me, and has diffuser, too.  Has 2 settings for temp.  Good value and easy to handle."
"Don't understand everyone's negative reviews about this dryer.  It dries my hair in half the time my old dryer took, it is no louder than any other blow dryer I've ever used, the controls are not difficult to use at all (you just push them upwards, for heavens sake!), and the retractable cord retracts exactly as it should.  The best thing is, even with all the positive things about the dryer, it didn't cost an arm and a leg like some I looked at.  &#34;Sticker&#34; shock indeed.  I love it!"
"Totally diggin my hair dryer.  Gift from hubby!  Needed something quiet that didn't wake up the kids.  2 levels of speed (low works as well as high, just more quiet), 2 heat levels, ions can be on/off, cool blast button, small, light, love!!!"
"Love, love, love this little hair dryer! I got it because it tucked into my smallish bathroom cabinet but was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. It has at least as much power as the full size dryer I am replacing. I haven't missed the old one for a minute. Plus, as promised, this has a very compact size that makes storage and travel easy."
"This dryer dries my hair quickly, leaving it smooth and shiny.  And my hair requires less touching up on the second day."
This hair dryer works great!  My hair is dry in half the time and it's much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air.
Very convenient and easy to setup. Everything was in the box and the directions were easy to follow. I would definitely recommend especially as an investment to save money.
"It's a nice hair dryer. Dries hair good. Has different options to chose wether you want to dry it with cold, warm or hot air. During my life I had different kind of hair dryers, and this one is as good as my other ones. Did not really noticed the difference. But it does what any hair drier suppose to do. And yes, it's made in Thailand."
I bought this dryer for my 7 year old as her first hair dryer.  It's very small and lightweight so she can easily hold it.  She enjoys being able to dry her own hair.
"Heats up fast, cools down quick. No waiting or anything, great product. It really worked on my wet curly hair"
"Love it dry so fast , not very good with freez but for the price is good."
"The dryer is really good but came with a missing part (diffuser) but as it is not really needed, am not bothered by it. Arrived early and well packaged. Would recommend it. Very easy to use."
love it! heavy and durable hair dryer
"makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment. it is lighter than the one I had before. it is not small, so that's a disadvantage if you are traveling. but it is powerful. recommend it"
"This wall-mounted hair dryer was the smallest one available, and that is why I selected it. It fits perfectly in a small space, and it is as inconspicuous as a wall-mounted dryer could be. It works very well, too --it is quite powerful for such a petite dryer. I really love it!"
"After my $60+ salon brand hair dryer crapped out on me after like 4 months, I decided to just look for a hair dryer with a great price. I did not even realize that it's a conditioning dryer and now my hair never looked better! My old dryer made my hair look dry and unhealthy and I can't believe how much better it looks now. I love it!! It doesn't get super hot but dries my long thick hair fast and fluffy. I've had it for a little over a year now and it is still working great."
"I ordered this dryer to replace a &#34;Vidal Sassoon&#34; branded hot comb/dryer that had served me well for many years.  I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job."
So far I love this hair dryer. I was bummed that my old Conair died after 10 years. Yes you read that right. 10 years!! I loved that hair dryer and I loved how quickly it dried my hair. The new dryer works well so far. It has different speeds and heat levels on two different controls which I really like. The cold air button works great. I really have no complaints.
I've had this hairdryer now for about 3 - 4 weeks.  Just love the low heat setting - temperature remains comfortably low even when increasing the speed to high.  It is fairly light and quieter than others I've had.
"I really like this dryer!  Only had it a few weeks but so far it works great!  It arrives set for a lower wattage to save energy and I did not even bother to change it.  It drys quickly and as dryers go, quietly.  The night light is still burning bright.  Some have complained too bright and that they would like a switch to turn off the light.  You can always unplug it.  If I was looking for faults I think they might look at how the hand held blower fits the wall bracket.  It is somewhat of a tightfit.  An occasional dab of soap on the base of the handle eases the snap in and out.  This is a great improvement over the last brand we had."
"Love it! My tabletop dryer dried my hair in about an hour and 30 mins.. This takes an hour to dry and is super quiet.i  It is bulky and an eye sore in my bedroom - the old dryer folded and I stored in my closet.  This is too big to fit in there,, but I'm glad I purchased it."
"I'm sooo glad I bought this blow dryer, it gets my African American hair really straight and makes flat ironing 10 times easier! The comb attachment is the best part, next to the hot and cool switches you can flip to the position you want without having to hold them down. Buy this blow dryer and you won't want another one."
"Great price. It's a good brand, I did my research and its easy to control because of the different heatsettings .i recommend . Others brands are expensive when you could just get this product for less."
"I bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it.  When friends would use it, they'd always wanted to know where I got it but it had been so long that I forgot.  When it blew out (because I dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many'o years) I knew I had to replace it.  I searched for it on Amazon and sure enough, they had it and you can't beat the price.  It's quiet and does a great job on long hair."
"While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  My wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart, but that was after 5-10 years of regular use.  My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc. It's just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement. I use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute."
"Powerful little guy!!  Does the job, neat, compact. Love it!  JJ"
"Pros:  - Fits well in hand and is easily maneuverable  - Puts out high volumes of air at a high-enough temperature  - Very compact; fits in a very small space  - Night light is surprisingly useful; it lights the way to the bathroom without being so bright as to be distracting    Cons:  - Power cord length is not adjustable  - Included mounting screws/anchors are flimsy    I bought this Andis dryer to replace a similar type Conair unit that died after about a year's use.  My wife's habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    This is the smallest unit of its kind I've seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase."
"LOVE this hair dryer. I stayed at a hotel that had an Andis dryer in it, and immediately fell in love. It's very powerful (I use the low setting every day), and it dries my hair very quickly. I have thick, long hair, and it takes about 8 minutes."
"I really like this hair dryer.  Maybe it's because ours was old and no longer did the ion thing, but this one prevents frizz and dries hair very quickly.  And its not huge.  It's a normal size in my opinion, smaller than many in the market.  Could not ask for more in a hair dryer."
All three shades work beautifully. However if you are fairer complected. Stick with Bare your Soul and Look on the Bright Side. This one is a bit corally with a ever so slight shimmer. Its all sheer and will work but would just look better on Asian/African American/Latin skin tones. You can't go wrong so don't sweat the exact shade.
"I purchased this for a professional hair stylist with ten years experience.  This is the best dryer she's used thus far.  The price was amazing, less than half of what I almost paid locally.  Drying hair with this is much like aiming your head at a turbine engine with very high velocity constant airflow and heat, it dries hair in about 1/3 the time of others she's used.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"This dryer is so easy to handle, dries your hair quickly without drying it out (like regular blow dryers do).  It also gets your hair pretty straight, so you only have to go over it with a ceramic flat iron for a more intense shine or control of the ends of your hair (curl or flip or bend, etc...)"
"Powerful, lots of fan settings, cold air button, and best of all, a retractable cord! I like the folding handle for traveling, too.Great product. I can blow my hair dry and blow out of here for a quick appointment!"
High wattage drys hair very fast
"I love it, it's not too heavy, not loud, the cored about 4ft, gives good heat, and leaves my hair soft and silky."
"I LOVE MY HANGING HAIR DRYER, I NEVER HAVE TO DRAG IT OUT OF A DRAWER AND PUT IT BACK IT IS ALWAYS THERE IT HAS A NIGHT  LIGHT BUT I USUALLY UNPLUG IT UNLESS I HAVE COMPANY THE LIGHT COMES IN VERY HANDY THEN IT HAS PLENTY OF AIR FOR BLOWING MY LONG HAIR AND I ALSO LIKE THE WAY I CAN HANG THE CORD UP"
"We now have two of this identical model. The first one worked out well so we bought another for a second bathroom. I can't speak to whether it makes my hair any shinier, but it does a good job of drying my hair and that's all I ask for. It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog. I have noticed that the exterior doesn't get as hot as my old dryer so I don't have to be careful where I set it when I'm done. I have no idea what to do with the finger/curly thingy attachment -- maybe I need curly hair to appreciate its use."
I have very thick hair and go through blow dryers quite frequently. I am always upset when I have to spend so much($75+) on something I know I will have to replace.<br /><br />Well this dryer has been WONDERFUL! I have had it much longer than I have had any other blow dryer. Also I can rest easy knowing that if I do have to replace it it is well within a reasonable price.<br /><br />Thank you Conair!
This is the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. It provides tons of power and isn't loud. It dries my hair quickly and doesn't hsve shutting off issues like other dryers I have used. The bed head brand seems to be experts in their field and make products that work well and hold up well. They last a long time and I have no complaints.
Worth evey single penny. does not burn hair. Would order another one in a minute if it broke. I will never buy another cheap blow dryer again.
I've been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years!  There's a reason I keep buying it even though it seems to die after 4-5 yrs of constant use.  The nightlight is perfect for the master bath.  Now we don't wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light.
This hair dryer replaced one my Mom had been using for the past 25 years or so. I finally convinced her it was time when the old one was broken in so many places I just could not fix it anymore though the motor was fine.  She loves the new one because it resembles the old one in so mnay ways but with improvements.  She is delighted with this Conair HH320LR.. Could not be more pleased.
"I actually ordered this for my sister. She lives in the Houston area and has very thick, frizzy hair and all the hair dryers we tried locally really just didn't do the trick. This dryer is hot (but not to hot) and blows very strongly and allows her to dry her hair quickly before she gets too hot herself. Good product."
I am very happy with this dryer.  All the settings and attachments let me do almost anything with my hair.  I have a bad right arm and can't use curlers so this really helped me look presentable!
"Our first Conair lasted 7 years of daily rigorous use. This replacement is a clone in every respect and fits the bill, compact, lightweight and powerful. The price is right as well."
Best hair dryer ever! My hair has been so easy to manage with it especially with my very very thick hair.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone.
Love this hair dryer becuse its small and powerful!
Love hair dryer. Wish the cord was longer like the original dryer purchased a few years ago!  Why did they shorten cord??
"As always, the Oster Wall Hair Dryer is convenient and I am satisfied. Although, my previous ones from many years ago were somewhat smaller."
Item was the exact item as seem on the pictures. Came with all three extra pieces for blowing out the hair. Use it recently n it was good......I must say its very hot.  Good tool. Its just to see how long it will last. But no regrets in this purchase n I'm loving my dryer
"This dryer replaced our old one, which finally gave up the ghost.  It is powerful and easy to control with the dual thumb-controlled switch which regulates heat and fan speed."
May be old style but works like it should!  Finally one that won't die every 16 months! I love it
"We used to buy the more expensive name brand hair products.  After reading reviews of this dryer, we decided to try it.  There are three girls in my family and we all use and love this dryer!"
I had just used it once last night but I know it just what I want. Strongly recommend. It's better than what I had expected.
The wife loves this.  She's in sales and is very particular about her hair. Neatness really counts in her business. The item is all it was stated to be. We'll packaged delivered on time. She can't stop talking about this item. She's telling all hers friends.
"This blow dryer was purchased to replace a similar one.......just love the fact that the cord retracts!  It's not cumbersome, has two speeds and a cooling option.  Terrific value for the money."
"great dryer, works well.  Lots of heat and volume when I need it, nice cooling button.  Dries my hair fast.  Amazon got it to me overnight when mine died, so I only went 1 day with bad hair.  Not bad, because I don't have time to shop at the brick and mortar."
"I bought this hair dryer to replace one that I borrowed from a friend that burnt out because I used the electric converter incorrectly. Because the price was so reasonable and because I had to reach $25 for free shipping, I bought two and kept one for myself. I use this dryer every day and couldn't be happier with it. My hair is somewhat long (little below shoulders) and this dryer is light, powerful, and drys my hair quickly. It would make a terrific travel dryer. It works much better than those found in most hotel rooms. At this price you can't go wrong. The fact that it has the dual voltage is a nice plus."
"Dry hair extremely quick and leave hair in a perfect condition.<br />It needs less about half time than other hair dryer.<br />And the hair is smooth without any damage.<br />It is an impressive product.<br /><br />Cons is the weight. It is heavier than other brands.<br />However I don't have to hold it for too long since it dries hair super quick, hence the weight is not too big an issue to me."
"How great can a hair dryer be?  Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  If you're looking for a great hair dryer that also can travel the world with you, this one is the one!"
ANDIS BLOW DRYERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES YOU BUY IN CHAIN STORES.  THEY DRY YOUR HAIR MUCH FASTER AND MAKE WAVY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE. THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT THEY ARE HEAVIER THAN THE STORE STANDARDS AND YOUR ARMS GET TIRED. I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GREAT LOOKING HAIR FAST AND EASY
"It is soooo light, it's more powerful than expected! I have medium length hair and it dried quickly even on the lower setting. This is my 1st tourmaline ceramic hair dryer and I'm very impressed. I plan to replace my daily dryer with this one or maybe another tourmaline ceramic one because it has definitely improved the smoothness of my hair. Also comes with black/white storage bag which is kinda nice. It does not fold, which I knew when I purchased it but it's not necessary feature since it's so small! Highly recommend!"
I like this hair dryer. I just needed one quickly so I didn't really check it out. I just grabbed it and ran. It dries very well without burning your head off and that is an important thing. I don't want my hair burnt but I don't want to take a long time either. This one does both those things. I highly recommend it. I think you'll like it too.
"I suggest you don't waste your cash on those expensive hair dryers when you can buy this one.  It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer's wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I've looked!).  The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  I've only used this a couple of times, so I don't know how long it will last.  So far, so good."
"Great price, great blow dryer! I travel a lot and always need a small but powerful one. I end up leaving mine behind when I go to places such as Cuba where they can't get any, and I simply replace it when I get home."
I used the one much more expensive than this before but it broke and I bought this. It works really well so far and its Ionic function makes my hair smooth and soft. I'm very satisfied with it.
LOVE this hair dryer.  My hair used to take forever to dry and this does the job in half the time if not less.  My hair always feels nice and soft after I am finished drying it and is not frizzy.  A huge improvement over my $20 hairdryer from Target.
"Very light dryer, and has a nice grip and feel to the handle.  I have very long hair and it dried my hair very fast with very little frizz.  I would highly recommend this dryer.  I love it!"
"I finally realized just how much my tiny travel hairdryer was damaging my hair so I started searching for a new one. I picked this one, and I am very happy with it so far. I use a small amount of leave-in conditioner and a few drops of a defrizz product and my hair turns out great! The dryer has a nice array of settings; I usually put it on the hottest setting because the others don't seem warm enough. The cool setting works well, too. The dryer is fairly quiet, too, even at high settings, which is a huge change from my travel dryer. The one drawback I've found so far is the weight of this dryer. My travel dryer was of course very light and compact so it's been an adjustment getting used to the size and weight of this one. My arm gets a little tired as I'm finishing, but it's not a big problem. Definitely a good purchase!"
"Bought this to replace a higher wattage hair dryer.  We would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer (1800W, I think) since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit.  This lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast (I think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage).  The textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips.  Hightly recommended."
"This is a great dryer; the handle folds down for easy compact storage.  I also like how it is dual voltage, but I'm not sure if the 1875 will withstand the wattage overseas."
"I was looking for a lightweight and quiet dryer.  This is perfect.  Although I do not need the long cord now, it would have been great in other bathrooms.  Love the quiet .  It is replacing an old Brookstone that was very quiet but also pretty heavy."
"I replaced a Conair 1600 which was used daily for several years and finally died. I bought this based on the numerous good Amazon reviews and because some have said that the 1850 watt dryers might not work outside the U.S.  Delivery was swift. The dryer feels substantial and well built. It dries more quickly than the old Conair without hair looking like I stuck my finger in a socket. As was mentioned before, this will dry anything short of a wookie very quickly. Highly recommended.  10/19/10: Just received a second Andis 33805 ordered 6 days ago as backup in the event this model 33805 is discontinued. The original has performed flawlessly and continues to feel well built."
Bought this model a few years ago and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  This model's high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  Also it is light and well balanced so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.
"This dryer never fails me. It does a great job every time. It gets super hot, which can be dangerous."
"Good, Handy. Easy to use. Small enough to put in suitcase when traveling. Takes up very little space when storing.."
"My daughter was thrilled with this blow dryer. It is so compact, that it makes packing it a breeze. It is a little heavier than you would think it would be though."
"I am really picky about hair dryers since I have long very think hair. I used the new dryer this morning and my hair dried quick and frizz free. It usually takes me 45 minutes to blow dry my hair and it only took 25 minutes. SO HAPPY!! I just got it, but so far so good!"
Best blow dryer for your $ !!!! I have coarse thick long hair... And this blow dryer gets my hair dry in no time! Definitely worth it! :)
"I have limited strength in my hands and therefore needed the smallest and lightest weight hair dryer I could find and this fit the bill!  The main brands seem to no longer carry one this small, so really had to hunt for this one.  The low speed seems more like a medium speed which I liked."
Love it - not an overly strong blow dryer which I like because I don't have thick hair.  It's nice and light so my arm doesn't get tired.  No frizz either.
My wife and I always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel. This is exactly what we were looking for. It pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer.
"Chose this particular hair dryer after comparing the features with other similar products. I am so glad that I went with this one because it is the best hair dryer I have ever had!! Ever!! I am not even talking about the fact that drying my hair time is cut in half, but what is really amazing that my hair looks so much better. It suddenly has some shine, including the ends that use to look very frizzy. And that is not all. I use round brush  while drying my hair and now that is enough to lift the roots of my hair!. I use to use a product that suppose to help lift the roots and I hated because that product was smelly and It really wasn't doing much , but now this amazing hair dryer makes my hair look healthy and even fuller because of the lift.<br />I LOVE IT!."
"Living in the South, humidity takes it's toll on my hair so I was excited to visit Vegas where I'd heard there's &#34;no humidity.&#34; I planned to use the hotel's hair dryer (MGM) to lighten the packing. The hair dryers they equip the rooms with were amazing and I kept telling my husband how much I loved it and how quick it dried my hair!! (I wanted to take it home but he wouldn't let me! ha) He told me it was probably just the dry air there and didn't understand my excitement over this hair dryer. Long story short, I got on Amazon as soon as we got home and ordered it. I AM IN LOVE! This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half and leaves hair shiny and smooth (and trust me, I have frizzy, wavy hair!) I still use the flat iron of course to finish off the job but this hair dryer has been a life saver!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
"I waited 6 mos to write this review because I wanted to be sure it atleast lasted that long. This thing is perfect for home use. I use it on myself and my daughter. roller sets come out perfect. twistouts dry in half the time wash and go's have less shrinkage because the gel cast sets faster. I'm so glad i ordered this product. It is top heavy when you try and roll it I support the bottom and top as I push but it mainly stays in one spot. The bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you've forgotten what you were doing. i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up, at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min. In Short... I love this dryer and if anything happened to it I would gladly purchase again. I ordered my dryer the week of Christmas it was on my doorstep the next day"
Love the hot pink!  Different speeds and heat settings are fantastic.  Re-tractable cord works well.
"I got this hair dryer for mom because her carpel tunnel syndrome had been acting up and her hair dryer had become too heavy for her. This hair dryer is TINY! Don't be fooled by it's size though, very powerful for a low-watt dryer. It's actually kept her hair healthier from the low watts, though her drying time has remained the same. It's also the perfect travel size hair dryer. Heck, it fits in her purse! I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well. It does not come with a 'cool shot' setting, which I thought would make achieving curls more difficult. The attachments are tiny as well, so the air does not diffuse much as a regular size hair dryer does. However, because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever!  I don't have to use hot rollers anymore because I can more readily control the direction of air on my hair with each stroke much like my hairdresser."
This little dryer is amazing.  Not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders.  My cousin just loves it.
"I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer. Do not be fooled by its size and &#34;full size&#34;. It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes. It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively. It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry. It comes with the nozzle attachment for focussed drying and prevention of frizzies. It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is and I manage to dry my hair with only one hand, while combing with the other hand."
"I love the power of this blowdryer, it is the only one that works for me, I have tried others and there is a big difference, I am glad that I was able to find this one, they are not easy to find.  Thank you for having it!"
"I had to find this model on Amazon because my local Targets weren't selling this model anymore. My puppy chewed up my first one, and bought another type at Target, but it was SO loud, and I took it back. I'm happy that I found this for sale on Amazon because it's quiet-as far as blow dryers go- and I love the retractable cord. As long as they make this particular model, that will be my first choice if something happens to my new one."
"Used this dryer during a recent trip to Europe.  So easy to use in different countries and compact to carry. Couldn't ask for a better, more efficient dryer.  I even used it to warm cold food in my hotel room, but don't tell anybody."
My hair stylist recently showed me how to get my wavy hair to be a bit more curly by finger-styling my hair and then sitting under a hood dryer.  I purchased this hair dryer and it worked faster and better than the salon dryer!  I sit under it for about 4 minutes and my hair is dry enough to hold whatever style I give it.  I have a lot of hair so having it dry this quickly is terrific.  How nice it will be to have dry hair every morning this winter!<br /><br />The service was fast and the packaging was appropriate.  A totally positive experience.
"Reliable, reasonably loud, and lasts long. I used Conair before and those malfunction super easily."
works great!  Just a little heavy.
Great little hairdryer - especially for travel.
"I recommend this product , it's hot, powerful and will dry your hair quickly."
At first I thought that the light would be a negative but it works great as a night like when we have to get up at night.  And the dryer has more power than my old one so it doesn't take as long to dry my hair.  Thank you for your prompt service.
"It is a little heavy, but it is great for drying! All of my stylists use these!"
"This is second time i've bought this dryer, after first one servced me well.  It's powerful but not LOUD with that annoying whiney sound they usually make.  I love the recoil of cord.  Happy happy, for second time.  :)"
"This is a great help in drying and styling my hair since arthritis severely limits the range of motion in my shoulders. It takes a little getting used to as you move your head and brush instead of the dryer, but that only takes one or two uses."
I wanted one that blows hard and I could control the temperature too..this one works and the price was fair.
I use it quite often..Very good for this price. I hardly used the attachment that came with it..
"I shopped around for a blow dryer and was about to buy one for well over 100 dollars when I came across this one... so I thought I would give it a chance.  I am happy to say that I love it.  The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  The cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair.  The hot setting is super hot but I am sure works well with thick hair.  I mostly use the medium heat without any damage."
I purchased this to go with my Rusk W8less Professional Hair Dryer and it fits perfectly! I love that the bowl is large and really deep. This is a must-have for curly hair!
"I recently purchased [[ASIN:B000Q6V1UG Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline]] and found that the heated clips with these Remington rollers did not hold the roller in place, UNLESS I stayed really still, and that's not going to happen in the a.m.<br />The heated clip that remington has is a great concept, but the smooth, heated surface also makes it more slippery on dry hair.  So I ordered these Conair clips because they said they were large, and could withstand heat.  So now in addition to my heated clips, or in leiu of.. these were the perfect answer!  You can't heat these clips in the Remington unit, but they can withstand the very hot velour rollers, as well as blow-dryer heat.  They also can hold a jumbo size roller, large enough a roller for someone like me with really long and crazy curly hair that needs to be tamed! No slipping at all, and no crease marks with rollers!"
I enjoy using this product.  Dries long hair very fast.  I have no problem recommending this product to a friend.
"I didn't realize how close to death my old dryer had gotten until this one arrived. It dries my hair much more quickly and although it isn't quiet it's a much more tolerable noise than the whine my old one had developed. It is a bit heavy, but I like that...makes it feel sturdy and well made. The finish is nice too...kind of velvety. I definitely recommend this dryer!"
"I would recommend this dryer. works great, I have very thick hair and it dries it quickly. Fast delivery and item was as described."
this hair dryer is the great things that can use the less time to make my long hair dry. I love it
This blow dryer is great.  It blow dries my hair in about half the time of my old blow dryer.  It also helps tame my frizzy hair.  Love it.
"Works great; same dryer used by my hair stylist.  Here's the caveat:  Since I bought it from DiscountJungle via Amazon.com, the manufacturer would not honor their 4-year warranty.  They told me they only warranty products sold (at full retail cost) by their authorized vendors, adding that hair dryers sold by Amazon.com or by DiscountJungle were often used (not new) or knock-off copies of their product.  The manufacturer strongly recommended that I return the product to DiscountJungle, and buy one from their website, or from Nordstrom (one of their few vendors); then the manufacturer assured me they would warranty the hair dryer.  I phoned DiscountJungle, explained all this to them, and was assured that mine was brand new (sure looked new to me), and that DiscountJungle would honor the 4-year warranty.  I got that in writing from them, and then I was able to start using the hair dryer.  It was no fun going through all this.  Just be prepared..."
I came across this while staying at a Best Western. It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn't monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn't take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won't create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom. It also doesn't demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount. It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.
"Very powerful, need a red dryer for the wife. This one is very light so it's not very tiring for the wrist."
"I am so glad I found this hair dryer. I was initially looking for one that had the folding handle, but was not successful at the time. This one is smaller than the big bulky types and does the same job, just as good. It's easier to store being more compact and to keep out of the way, even to pack for travel.  I've had it for a year and still like it and it works as good as the day I got it. It's not quiet, but it's not overly noisy either - just sounds like a hair dryer."
"This little hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for, small, easy to travel with, and not too loud.  I checked for other travel size type hair dryers, but found that many of them were too big and wouldn't reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord.  This little hair dryer was perfect for my needs and does a great job of drying my hair and not making it frizzy as well.  I was prepared for any color to show up, but was pleased to get a white one with red details."
"I really love this little dryer.  It is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch. It dries my hair quickly and is not too loud, all things considered.  I would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker, but it does much better than your cheapie dryers, and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat.  I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn't look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.  I think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so I need to adjust for this better. Overall though, its the best quality for the price I have had in a dryer."
"Great product, great airflow. I bought one a few years back. Still working.<br />A little big for travel. However I bought another for the guest bath.<br />Everything I've ever wanted in a hair blower.<br />Delivery was prompt."
Love this hair dryer!!!  It gets hot enough and blows hard enough to dry your hair quickly!!!!  My teenage girls with long hair love it too!!!!  It also lasts forever!!!!
Love how compact this item is.  Nice not to have to dig around under cabinet to find a hairdryer.  It works so well for being such a small dryer.  Highly recommend this item
"I bought this for my 90 year old mother, she says its a great hair dryer, loves that it has 3 settings (low, med. high), and that the handle folds, and has retractable cord, also not loud."
"I have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and I love it.  It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  Other than that, I love it - my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it's not too heavy.  I am happy with my purchase."
"Great price, lightweight, long cord which makes drying my hair and shifting the dryer from hand to hand so much easier, not as noisy as my last hair dryer, and it does dry my thick medium length hair faster than my past hair dryers. I am able to switch from warm to hot and high, off, low without having to look at the dryer.  I really do love this hair dryer!!"
"It's little, and it's POWERFUL, what more do you want from something called &#34;Mighty Mini&#34;?<br /><br />For all the reviewers that complain about the size and how &#34;cheap&#34; if feels, realize that you are buying something made for travel, and that it cost a whopping $20.<br /><br />This is a great hair dryer and suits my needs perfectly.<br /><br />If you want a bigger, more expensive one, then go find one elsewhere."
I've been using this hair dryer for quite some time and have never been happier.  Wall mount keeps counters clear and I love the small size and light weight.  Thanks very much v/r Susan
"My conair hair dryer decided to bite the dust on me and the following day I was having a medical procedure done.  I was pressed for time so I ordered this one and have one day shipping.  I must say that I love this hairdryer.  It is pretty in color and looks exactly like it does online.  It is not too heavy and comes with two extensions.  I love the choices between low, medium and high and also low, warm, hot and cool.  I highly recommend this item.  It is not too noisy either."
"I used this hair dryer at my friends place and fell in love.  I showed up at Sephora expecting to pay $50 and saw that it was well over $200.  I bit the bullet and purchased it anyway and it's worth every penny.  My hair has never been softer or shinier.  In fact, it's improved over just towel drying.  Yes, it dries faster and is lighter, but as a male this was a less critical issue.  I really love how it leaves my hair soft, easily manageable (no static), and healthy.  Last week I bought one for my mom and more people are getting them for Christmas."
"I cannot believe how great this hairdryer really is. I searched and searched for months unsure of who to believe. I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before. As for lasting ability, it is a quality hairdryer, and I have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul."
"I bought this Two days ago as my old dryer (conair 1875 watt) hasn't been drying as well lately.  I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don't think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don't need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That's pretty astounding considering the price point.  I love this dryer,  and I'd buy it again in a heart beat.  I'm thinking about buying another one to store,  because I seriously love it that much!  Go buy it!"
This looks nice and is very convenient.  I especially like the little hook for hanging the cord up out of the way.  Has a lot of power for a little dryer and looks very nice and compact in my bathroom.  I would recommend this product.
"For just $7.99 & FREE Shipping (without even buying over $35.00) this is another very best buy, praise the Lord! Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don't need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower. It has two speeds with low and high heat, and a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     These run off 120v AC,  which is needed for the heating element, though  I assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v DC blower motor. These likely do not cost much to make, but some can be very expensive. Why pay more?"
Just received The Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer and am very pleased with product. Dryer is quiet and hair dried much quicker than before.<br />Would highly recommend!!!!!
"I bought this hair dryer after researching for more than probably 20 hours to figure out which one would fit my needs, etc. It has been well worth it! My hair dries more quickly and I'm getting awesome results with my round brush like I usually get at the salon. I would definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />Even though I would recommend this product, I am highly disappointed to find out that buying through Amazon and a 3rd party I am not covered by the warranty because neither of the companies are authorized resellers of the product. I found this out as I was completing the warranty form that has to be sent in. Had I known this ahead of time I would have gone to one of the authorized seller sites and paid $2 more to have a 1 year warranty. I am returning to Amazon as one of the authorized sellers has 20% off and no tax."
"My old Conair hair dryer finally smoked--it owed me nothing after many years of great service--and I couldn't find anything in the stores that measured up. Found this one online and so far, it's great. I love that it has options. 4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations. It was the only one I found like it. While the speed isn't as fast and the heat isn't quite as hot as the old one, it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it! After returning one that felt awkward and top heavy, I like that this one feels light and balanced. I don't have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality. Hoping it lasts as long as it's predecessor!"
"I have heard about how great tourmaline hairdryers are for years, but had never tried one. I'm a total convert at this point -- the T3 dries my curly hair straight and shiny, and it weighs practically nothing. It's a quiet yet very powerful little machine."
"My dentist recommended this system over all others, and I can see why after using it.  It feels like you just had your teeth cleaned every time you brush!  Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  Now, with the price cut in half, I could afford 2 of these for everyone in the house.<br /><br />The sterilization chamber holds 2 brusheads of either size and angles them towards a sanitation UV lamp (254 nm) - the cycle runs 15 minutes which is sufficient to kill anything on the bristles after use.  I've had my brushes over a year now and still am using the origianl lamp.  You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened (then it goes out) - plus the philips logo lights up from the UV inside but blocks the harmful rays from escaping by flourescing in the UV glow of the lamp.<br /><br />This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  My dentist recommended it to me, and I recommend it to anyone who doesnt't want to see their dentist as often!<br /><br />Positives:  It charges using an induction charger - meaning there are no exposed wires.  A coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush.  When they are in close proximity (2) they couple energy from the AC line to the brush under charge.  This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.<br /><br />Negatives:  The system has one li-ion battery.  Once it expires, philips provides a mechanism to use a screwdriver to remove the battery before throwing away the toothbrush, thus guaranteeing you will buy another one.  It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.<br /><br />Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  It's like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear's top load models in efficiency and economics.t.    Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  It's like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear's top load models in efficiency and economics."
thanks
"I bought this for my sister for her to use it for college. it came really fast, she loves it and it's very affordable. thank you. "
"My wife loves this thing, she said It feels like a real saloon."
"Works good for me, no problems and I use it damn near everyday"
I really like this product. The cord seems to be way longer than what I am used to. I really like the tools it comes with...
works great.......light enough to be comfortable.
More power than expected.
thanks
works really well.
Very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes-just like the professionals do it.
Makes my hair drying time much shorter.
Nice hairdryer. Simple and solid. I use mine for drying off my goldendoodle when she's been out in the rain.
thanks
"Quality hair dryer, this really moves some air."
I purchased this for my vacation home.  I liked it so much I brought it home and took the more expensive dryer I was using at home to my vacation home.
Dries my hair fast
Works better than expected
Better than expected.
Fast shipping and undamaged.
"This works very well.  It's my second Conair, and I think I will enjoy using it."
One of the best dryer for this price range. I like cold wave.
"fast shipping, A++++++++++"
"Even, fast drying"
This was my second one to own. It lasted for years. I hope this one will be the same. I recommend this hair dryer. Thanks Amazon. 
"the multitude of setting combinations allow me to control how my hair dries- its naturally very wavy and gets frizzy fast, but i haven't had any issues like that with this dryer yet."
"I love this blow dryer, its small and powerful, exactly what I wanted"
Works 100 times better than the old hair dryer. I'd definitely suggest it.
This hair dryer has a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly when I use the concentrator. Very quiet compared to my older blow dryer also.
Very convenient hair dryer
"Bought this for my mom, she loves it!! and arrived very promptly and packaged very well."
"I bought this for my wife because she borrowed one like this while staying with a friend and loved it.  Good power, multiple heat settings, and doesn't have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy.  The vent poece on the back is removeable for cleaning out lint that gets trapped in there... this is a great feature and should improve the life expectancy of this hair dryer."
"My hairdresser uses this blow dryer and recommended it to me when I told him I did not feel mine was powerful enough. This dries my hair in a fraction of the time as it used to take me. I love the adjustable settings for heat and for power, and the Ionic blast button for cold shots is great, too."
Light and very quiet.
"I have purchased these for every bathroom!  Not only are they handy, you don't have to waste space in your drawer.  The night light is also a gr8 feature for finding your way to the bathroom at night."
really nice?10/19/2014
This works very well for a travel blow dryer.
"Product is works as described. It is smaller in size than expected, but that is a good thing. All heat and speed settings work. Would recommend."
The hair dryer is inexpensive and is working very well.
Purchased for fast and efficient drying capability.
"It works much better than the last one, really professional dryer"
Powerful and not too loud
I like it thanks
LOVE THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DRAG THE BLOW DRYER OUT EVERY MORNING.  ITS THERE AND READY WHEN I NEED IT.
I purchased this item because of the retractable cord.  It is a powerful hair dryer but not too heavy.  I also purchased the Scalpmaster Hair Dryer Holder so I could keep it on my counter top.  I would recommend this dryer.
"This dryer just feels like a quality build. After a week of use, I will say that it performs way beyond what I expected. While I have relatively short hair and this dryer gets the job done in about one-fourth of the time my old dryer did. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it."
I love the automatic on/off feature when you use the dryer.  Powerful enough for my short hair.  Would purchase again.
"Excelent<br /><br />terrible Tommy Hilfiger Men's 4 Pack Boxer Brief, Red/Navy/White, Large<br />Tommy Hilfiger<br />How does this product fit?  ffffffffffffffffweryt3r veqtwrvrv qr3"
"After using the Onei flat iron I decided to see what other Onei products I could purchase. This blow dryer is fabulous. I have a lot of hair and because of the dryers power, my blow dry time has been shortened. Every time I use this dryer i feel like I am at a salon because the blow dryer is top of the line. No more blow dry bars for me. I am more then happy to blow dry my own hair with the Onei Hair dryer."
"This dryer leaves all the shine and body in fine hair without sacrificing drying time. It's evident now that the previous expensive, super powerful, tourmaline dryer was blowing the body and shine out of the hairstyle. Many bad hair days blamed on aging/change of life that were actually caused by the too powerful dryer.<br />With absolutely no changes to hair drying routine or styling products all hair drying sessions have produced good hair days. A most pleasant surprise to recapture more youthful hair.<br />This dryer is much quieter than the previous one. The brushed finish and brown body/pink accents feel good to the touch and pleasing to the eye."
"This item came fast and as of this writing, she hasn't opened the gift.  Looking forward to seeing her eyes on this item.  Thanks again."
"I had no problems with this, it works; the diffuser was what I really wanted (the concentrator I haven't tried) and that works too."
"I discovered this while on vacation recently.  All of the hotels we have stayed in recently have had this blow dryer available for guests.  It's light weight, fairly quiet, and the variable temperatures sold me.  It also has a cool button which is fantastic when it's hot.  I actually ordered this from Amazon while still on vacation so it would be at my home when I returned."
we have a tiny bathroom with no storage.this hair dryer is so perfect.it's out of the way when not in use.does not take up drawer space.even has a night light.
"This was a great purchase. The unit is relatively quiet, simple and works better than expected. It is so convenient to use every day. The night light is a small but appreciated bonus!"
"LOVE IT, this is my third one.  great speed light weight.  only wish they lasted longer.  but for the price you can't go wrong"
I chose this dryer based on product description and customer reviews.  It performs well and is lightweight.  I highly recommend!
"I really can't rate this one, because it was a x-mas gift, but my sister asked for it and she had had one just like it and she asked for another one, so I guess she loves it."
"My daughter-in-law picked this gift to her wish list for Christmas, we bought it, and it is working very well."
"got this for my mom, her old hair dryer stopped. she loves this one. and when it is on hot, it is hot"
my wife had this itme before for more than 10 years and she sed that she love the way it works for all this time that she used this item. she ask me to buy this one because the other one it burns the extension cord actually the plug of the extension and this one have a reset and a power control on the plug so it might be better than the other one and it doesnt get to hot like the old ones
Fast and helpful used them before would use them again I choose them over my pro distributer that all folks
"I purchased the black one via Amazon and I am very pleased with the product so far. I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Loving it so far!"
"It dries my hair quickly, is small enough to pack in my suitcase, has a retractable cord, and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth. And you can't beat the price either. I'm never buying another dryer brand/model as long as this one is in production."
We used this blowdryer in a hotel and liked it.  Couldn't find it in any stores so I ordered it from amazon.  After we got it my husband told me to order another one for a back up and I somehow made two orders.  I let my daughter use one and we still have one put up for a back up.
"So far, I have been pleased with the purchase.  If that changes, I will come back and adjust my review."
I got this for my sister. She absolutely loves it. She does a lot of traveling and is used to a   hairdryer like this.
"Well worth the money.  We always bought inexpensive hair dryers, but now can see the difference a professional model can make.  Would buy again."
If you enjoy the convenience of a wall mounted air dryer when you travel....why not have the same at home ! This mounted unit keeps my sink area uncluttered. It is attractive...works well and out of the way.
"My old Con-Air finally bit the dust. I had been impressed with my hair stylist's hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget. However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time. I have very short, very, very fine hair. When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle. Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds. A lot of what's available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair. I did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this. The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good decision.<br /><br />Happily enough, turns out I was correct! This unit feels solid. It is well-constructed, and doesn't have the &#34;hot spots&#34; like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere. It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand. The bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use. It is also powerful! The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I've used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly. Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I've ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse. It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs. If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot! So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you. It also comes with a concentrator nozzle, the output width of which in my opinion, is the perfect length. Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair. But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2&#34;, perfect for a shortie like me.<br /><br />What more can I say? I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous. It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don't even think mine had packaged instructions with it. But it works just as well as my stylist's professional dryer and at a terrific price point. I would buy again in a heartbeat (but hopefully I won't have to, at least for a long, long time)."
"This hair dryer is worth every penny! I read an article by a top hair stylist who recommended this dryer.  So when my over $100 infrared hair dryer broke after one year, I decided to give this one a try. I'm so glad I did because not only is it light weight, it cut my drying time down, and it helped smooth out my hair. I never knew a dryer could do that, especially when all my other dryers would leave my natural curly hair looking frizzy."
"This is the second time i've purchased this dryer. It's long lasting. i had my last dryer for 5 years and it only broke because i dropped it twice really hard on tile floors. It still worked but i could hear it was not doing well so I purchased another one. If you need a diffuser, Bio Ionic Universal Diffuser fits perfectly. This is the best dryer for thick hair and beauties with natural/curly hair textures. Its really strong. I do hair on the side and its perfect for heavy use."
"The heat is SUPER STRONG, so I would advise people to be careful. Some hair types can handle heat better than others, but heat in general isn't the best for your hair. I personally like it. I have transitioning hair (relaxed to natural African American hair, it's extremely wavy, coily and stubborn), so the heat really helps me a lot."
"It's noisy.  I knew when I bought it that it wasn't silent.<br /><br />It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I'm not putting air where I don't want it and making my hair poofy.  I like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out.  The controls are side -by- side on the handle.  On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a cool button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.<br /><br />Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you. It does sort of catch in two places, so it won't close on your hand - there is also an inch and a half/two inch gap, so it's impossible to hurt your hand. I use it on my hair and also on beeswax sheets for rolling candles.  Works really well :)"
"My daughter confiscated my older travel hair dryer so I decided to replace it with this one.  Maybe I should thank her because this dryer is FAR superior to my other one.  Even though it's only 1600W, it puts out a lot of air and my hair dries in no time.  I love the fact that it's a lower wattage as many older hotels throughout Europe can't handle anything higher.  How do I know?  I purchased an 1800W dual voltage one time and managed to blow out half the circuits in an old hotel in Venice."
"My old hair dryer died.  I wanted something small and lightweight so my arm wouldn't get tired.  This works great.  Dries my hair fine, I do have short hair though.  I don't think I will ever use the diffuser and the other doohickey.  Very satisfied.  I also like the pouch.  Nice for travel."
This hairdryer is great. I bought it because we recently moved and I couldn't find my hairdryer in the sea of boxes. ( I've had mine a long time so it was also a good excuse to get a new one.) I have fine thin hair. This hairdryer not only dries my hair very quickly but it gives it a lot of volume that I really need. I'm very happy with my purchase. I realize now how lousy my old dryer is.
I have long thick hair and it usually takes a long time to blow dry. Not with this dryer! It is the best one I ever had. I could not believe the price was so good. Love It!
This is our second unit after 10 years of daily service.  The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered.  We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers.
I love my Andis Ceramic blow dryer. Not only does it get our hair dry quickly but it also straightens at the Sam's time. Can't get no better for me and my family. Quick and easy!
Great hair dryer my wife loves it.  She says it's as good as her expensive high end model that it replaced and weighs less.
This is the second time I have bought this dryer. My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one so it wouldn't atay hung up anymore. I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years & I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style. Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying!
"I bought this well over a year ago but wanted to write a review since I enjoy this hair dryer so much. What I love about it most is the retractable cord--awesome invention. I also like that you can remove and clean the filter. Noise level is standard for a hair dryer, maybe even slightly quieter than average. My only criticism is that it is the heaviest hair dryer I have owned. So glad I bought this and not a super cheap one."
"Great blowdryer, works as good as any I've used before. Looks great. Lots of blow dryers are tacky and come in ugly colors. And also really heavy. This gets as hot and works as well as more expensive, heavier ones I've seen. Love that it's light weight and solid black."
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE NEW HAIR DRYER!!!<br />Exactly what I was wanting, my hair is thick and short and this hair dryer is amazing at getting my hair dried quick!!!"
"I've been using this for about a week now. I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.<br /><br />2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!"
This was a replacement to my old one which I had for a very long time. The old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed.  My husband didn't want me to continue to use it for fear of being electrocuted because of exposed wires.  Dryer was still working though.  The new one works just fine. I will be taking this with me when we go to U. K.
"I love the size, power & settings! Also, the browdryer has a really nice look & is powerful too. I feel it gets hot enough on the hottest setting, medium heat on the medium setting & low heat on the low setting. I also like the cool air button too. I'm Black with relaxed African american hair and it works just fine for me."
I was able to test drive this hair dryer at La bellaserra hotel in Paso Robles.  It was so fantastic I had to get one for home.  Leaves your hair soft and dries it  in less time!
This is a professional hair dryer. It dries hair quickly and it lasts and can be repaired. I would highly recommend it.
"Mine was getting quite old and cranky and I decided time for a new one, this has hot and cold setting, great power and is not terribly noisy."
"I have purchased a number of Conair hair dryers - they last forever. This dryer came with a diffuser in the box, which is a great addition. While it does not have a multitude of settings, it has what you need to get your hair dry. It is not insanely loud, either. If you are looking for a good work horse hair dryer that will last; look no further than this Conair."
Dries hair really fast as it has good volume of air and the air temperature is just right. Only problem is that it works for 110 V AC (US domestic voltage) only.
"Not pure lavender oil but it works well.  It is not too greasy and it is very flexible in the way it can be used.  You can use it in baths, after shower/bath or in massages.  Better than advertised."
"Best hair dryer, definitely worth the money! Gets super hot, fast, making it so much easier to blow dry my hair since usually itll take an hour to dry but only takes about 15 minutes with this one!"
"The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer is a great little personal grooming appliance.  It has two settings: Low and High.  I use High almost exclusively, even though I have fine, short, grey hair because I don't like to dawdle over grooming in the morning.  Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.  This is the BEST of the lot.  I actually gambled and bought two at once because compact dryers are getting hard to find now, and my confidence has been rewarded.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick solution to get going in the morning after your shower, look no further.  This one's a winner!"
"This dryer BY FAR IS THE BEST EVER!!!! I have really long hair extensions and they take FOREVER to dry, and after reading the reviews for this dryer I decided to try it because they say drying in half the time.<br />They weren't kidding, this dryer is AMAZING to say the least, I have never owned such a great product that is so inexpensive; so do yourself a favor, purchase this dryer, you wont be sorry, it is truly the best! Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all. And side note, it really does dry in half the time, which means an extra 20 mins in the morning hitting the snooze button ; )"
Have used it for over two months now and love it.  Easy to install and the cord stays neat on the hook.  Powerful enough to dry my short and in less than 3 minutes. My main reason for purchasing this was to find something I could hang-on the wall for easy access to use daily and to have it stored nicely in our main bathroom when not in use.
A hotel I stayed at had this model. Loved it so much came home from my trip and ordered it. Dries my hair quickly and small enough that it doesn't take up too much counter space in my bathroom.
"I first used this hair dryer at a friend's cabin and I was hooked. The motor is quiet, the dryer itself is pretty light, the blow is intense, and the best part? It gets super hot. You can barely hold your hand under it for too long. I immediately went home and bought it online. I have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half. My hair seemed fuller and shinier. My roommate was so jealous that she ran out and bought one as well. We both are big into hair tools and are now the biggest fan of this hair dryer. I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!<br /><br />The only downside to this dryer, is that it does not come with the defuser attachment. Please, Conair, gimme a defuser!<br /><br />I would recommend this dryer to anyone with hair."
"i am a hair dresser in NYC. i typically need a new blow drier ever year or so. usually i buy this one. when i haven't and i have tried other driers (and there have been many!) they are never as good as this one. if you are shopping for an at home drier this will last forever. it is very light, its fast, its hot. you can turn the ionic function off (which if you have coarser frizzier hair that is what you need anyway). it is also pretty hardy. my tools get dropped all the time. other driers crack and stop working quickly, but not this one.   you can't go wrong here, and the diffuser that goes with this drier is really great too.  enjoy!"
"VERY powerful, and with 3 heat settings, and two speed settings, this has everything the pro's want .... A very well made product that is built to last ... I give it the highest rating."
Fabulous - had one before that lasted 9 years.  Hope this one lasts as long.  So easy just to grap off the wall instead of searching through drawers for regular hair dryers. Hotel style - very convenient.
Absolutely LOVE this dryer! I have really thick/coarse hair and have always had to flat iron my hair after drying; but not anymore!!! 15 minutes and I am ready to go!!! No flat iron necessary!!!
"For the price, you can't beat it. Simple to use - no adjustments beyond &#34; Low - Off - High. What more can a person want!"
Makes my hair shiny and soft.  I love this flat iron!  Great deal compared to other quality flat irons!  I would highly recommend to anyone.
Purchased to replace an older model that finally died.  This is a great little unit and much nicer than it's predecessor.
"I love this hair dryer!  The power it delivers is perfect and it seems to dry my hair in half the time of my old one. The speed and heat buttons are 'user friendly' and the heavy cord is nice and long. Altho it's not quite as light as I'd imagined and maybe even a little bigger than my old one, I wouldn't consider it to be heavy or bulky and it's still quiet and powerful.  Good value for the money."
I Love this blow dryer its like one of the coolest things ive ever seen i got tired of the wires from a blow dryer being all on the floor and ground and this product eliminates that problem its pretty strong too.
My 20 yr old dryer died :( and I replaced it with this one. It is wonderful. Works well and the heat settings are easy to change.
"Man, let me tell ya, this thing really blows; and I mean that in a good way.<br />Buy one, it will blow you away..lol"
"Love this dryer, I have had it for a long time now. works like new."
"Plugged it in, dried my hair.<br />Brilliant!<br /><br />Cord is a little short, if your socket is waaaay far away from where you normally sit or stand, but the dryer itself is good for what it does, not so hot that you feel like you are burning yourself, but effective in drying my thicker hair.<br /><br />I like it!"
"I was looking for an Ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair. I wasn't worried about compact or travel.<br /><br />It feels heavy enough to be quality, but not too heavy to use. The settings are good, although I expected a little more power from the high blower setting - but with the ionic tech it doesn't need to blow harder.<br /><br />The cool blast button doesn't react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low.<br /><br />For function, it's perfectly fine, no complaints with function.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like which is a &#34;feature&#34;, is the soft matte finish.  It's pretty when it's new, but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn't pretty.  I'm not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not. It's not terrible, but I don't like it, and it wasn't an issue with my former drier.<br /><br />There are so many products out there which are comparable, it's really hard to decide. I'm not 'super excited', but I'm happy."
"Right after I first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a California motel, I have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms.  I have used competitive designs in other motels, but find that this one is still the best, and is reasonably durable.  Based on my experience, I would guess that a unit is good for about 3,000 uses, at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use (not counting the cost of electricity).  In addition to high  and low fan settings, It also has two power (heat) settings; 1200 Watts and 1500 Watts; I prefer the higher one. The unit is shipped with the 1200 Watt setting.  In order to set it to 1500 Watts, you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch.  You can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit.  You may need to experiment some and use some sharp U-turns to get the length just right for your situation. You should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow, and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector. I use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod.  It fits just right into the pry notch. I too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model, but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit.  When you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip, it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in; the newer model uses a magnetic mount. You don't have to jam it in, but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand."
"This was a requested item for my daughter for Christmas. I don't use this so I can't comment on them personally. I have not heard from her as to whether she doesn't like this so that is a plus. Please check out the other purchasers that use this for a more concise review. I'm always glad when I can shop on Amazon for anything it saves me time, gas, and delivery issues."
"I'm not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly-away action.  This hair dryer is amazing.  It is heat controlled and not air controlled.  Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz. My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  But with Prime you'll get it pretty quick!"
"I moved and left my hair dryer so I ordered a new one the same as I had but improved.  It works good,it is easy to use, and looks better than the old one.  Clark"
"So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  She mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail, her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time.<br /><br />With our old high end hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as Hairnobyl because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees, dimmed the lights, made me turn up the TV really loud, the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible (her mouth would move...but...).  After the 30 minutes of excruciating noise I was climbing the wall...not to mention a repetitive-use shoulder pain she developed.<br /><br />Then I bought her this dryer.<br /><br />Her shoulder feels better because it's so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  It is also more effective...makes her hair really shiny.<br /><br />We now own two of these...they are great!  She's an expert, and when she raves about a hair product...trust me...it is WIN!"
"love this dryer.  it's quiet but powerful, and the 'cold' button really works without losing power! (unlike the last dryer I had). other reviewers mentioned it's weight, and yes it does feel more weighty than some dryers, but it's not a problem for me, sorta feels like it's more industrial and not cheap.  the outside texture of the dryer is nice too.  overall I think it was a great buy!"
"I used one of these hair dryers at a hotel back in 2008 and when we returned from our trip I immediately ordered 2. I recently dropped the original one and broke it so had to get the backup second one I had ordered out to use. Then I ordered another back up just in case. I have been caught short before (by different brands) and had to go to an event with wet hair. That will never happen again since I always keep a backup now.<br />Gets the job done and it is a nice light dryer, packs easy. Just love these. Never stop carrying them, please!"
this is a goo product.  hair dresser recommended and uses one.  not sure how the pearl effect is supposed to sustain itself from the ceramic but oh well.  it does what it's supposed to do and I would recommend this to anyone looking for  a quality hair drier.  it was deliverd quickly and was packaged to arrive safely.
"Amazon here says I've been using this since September of 2011. Wow. Well, I still love it, has all the low to high, hot to cool options I need. I have no complaints about this and I would definitely buy it again if something were to happen to it.<br />Great purchase.<br />:)"
My mother used this in a hilton and loved it so she came home and asked me to purchase it for her.  Small and convenient!
"I've only used this dryer for a few weeks, but so far so good. I have long thick hair and only need to use medium speed on medium heat to get everything dry in 10 minutes. The ongoing polar vortex combined with my own bleary negligence every morning is a pretty good litmus test for any product, but I've only gotten my hair stuck in it once and it's not so hot I've damaged my hair. When all is said and done, I'm fairly impressed. With the dryer; not myself."
"I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related comments.<br />My wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years, I think).<br /><br />Anyway, I was looking for 220 Volt drier and had to return this one in the end"
"After having used a wall-mount Sunbeam hairdryer on vacation last summer, I really wanted one for my bathroom.  After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.  My husband had the hairdryer mounted on the wall in less than 10 minutes and that includes my running up and down the stairs for the right screwdriver.    All in all, an excellent buy and I would purchase it again."
"nice hot blow drye, lots of power. it is a little heavy so be prepared for that weight to start hitting you at the end of the day in your rotator cuff but i can breeze through any blowdry with ease. love it."
This is a great dryer! My first one finally died after 5 years of constant use and I ended up trying a similar Gold N Hot and it stopped working and overheated on the first use. I quickly ordered the Andis and have had no issues! I have long curly hair and it drys  my hair in under 20 min. I will definitely purchase this product a third time once I've worn the one I just bought out.
"My hair stylist had recommended it, after I told her it seemed to take forever to dry my hair at home, yet minutes in her salon. It's a great product, and not as high pitched as other dryers I've had."
Great little travel hair dryer! Very powerful for a little hair dyer
"This is the best $35 investment that I could have possibly made for my hair.  I have thick, coarse, curly-ish with a semblance of a wave hair so blow-drying it can be quite a challenge.  This hair dryer gets my hair very straight in no time."
"Best little Travel Dryer ever.  Very Powerful, very compact. Lasts forever. Does not produce static. I'm on my 3rd one, not because the previous two were faulty, but because I lost one and the other finally wore out. I only wish they made them in more colors. Buy this and you won't regret it."
"Straight forward, strong hot heat. I'm a guy and this thing is the simple hot strong wind I wanted. Simple High and Low setting. That's all."
"I have naturally curly hair and this hairdryer plus the diffuser have really brought out my curls! I love it! I use the setting below the high setting and then put it on cooler air as I am finishing up. I leave it a little bit damp. My hair is never frizzy with this hairdryer. The only thing I don't like about this hair dryer is the cord. It is not very long. I would recommend this hair dryer, especially if you have curly hair and like the use the diffuser. The price is not bad as it does include 2 attachments (the diffuser and another one to localize the airflow). I would purchase this again, but another 18 inches of cord would be nice."
Nice and compact with lots of drying power. Also not as loud as some other hair driers.
"Excellent dryer for the price! I've owned Hot Tools and other Conair dryers in the past, and so far this one has been the best. I bought this one to replace my older model Conair dryer that went out after 4 years of use. I really like that this one has the switch for the cool setting, rather than having to hold the blue button to get the cold blast (although it still has that button as an option). It's not as quiet as my last dryer, but my hair gets dryer faster without drying out the ends or creating static. My hair actually looks more shiny/silky after using this one than it did with the older model."
Purchased to replace same dryer we have had in out bathroom for the last 10 years. That should say everything.  The old one lasted 10 years and the fact I purchased the exact same model again tells you how happy I am with it.
Good but can not use in some Asian countries due to the voltage difference.
I really like this dryer and am enjoying using it.  My other one had bit the dust after about 7 years.
Was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it! I have thick curly hair and needs a hair dryer that can handle that in a jiffy ... found what I was looking for. Thanks!
My daughter loves this dryer. She enjoys using all the attachments and says it dries her long hair very quickly.
"Excelente! This dryer is light, strong, it makes hair shine, cuts half of the time of drying. I'm a professional and I definetely recomend it for professionals."
"The Oster Dryer came early and was exactly what I had ordered.  I can not live without a wall mounted dryer, because they are so convenient and handy to use.  I have had several of the dryers, but I wish they would last longer than one year.  Perhaps I use mine more than normal."
"I have very thick and corse - curly/wavy hair and I love this hair dryer!! It's nice and compact but has a lot of power. It dries my hair in half the time it used to with other bigger, more expensive dryers. I first used this in a hotel I stayed at and came on here the minute I got home to order it. For me, it's been so worth it! Love this!!"
"I was skeptical about paying this much for a hair dryer...but a friend of mine highly recommended it..so I gave it a go.  From my frist drying experience I noticed a huge difference in my hair!  It is super quiet...did dry my hair faster, with less force and no tangling!  I love how light it is...and how shiney it made my hair!  I got a load of compliments that first day!  Worth the cash!"
"OMG!!! This is the hair dryer for you. It straightens your hair especially if you have very very curly twisted hair, you'll get it pin straight with this dryer. The Hot setting is hot but it doesn't dry out or burn your hair. It is just soooo worth the money. I've had mine since 2008 and it still runs like the first day I bought it. I've taken it traveling with me (yes it is big - i just don't care because I can't live without it) and any of those cheap hotel dryers, burn my hair so much. No matter what, my hair comes out looking awesome from it. Just buy it.. you won't regret it."
"I needed a 2nd dryer to leave at a 2nd residence.  I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  This is fairly Compact, the handle folds up, the retractor works well but I always guide the cord back into the handle when I retract it (if you let it zip closed I believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism).  It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built=in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  A number of hotels like Marriott buy this Andis, and others that look almost identical, to place in their rooms.  One manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one"
"I bought this hairdryer because I stayed at a Marriott (Hilton?) in Providence, Rhode Island, and this was the hair dryer that the room was supplied with. I didn't think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth. I didn't realize what a competent little hair dryer this thing was until the next morning. When my hair was wet. And I need to dry my hair.<br /><br />The Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle seriously blows. I mean that. It puts out an impressive amount of heated air. The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you'd expect. The heat is nice. Nothing special there, but it dries hair.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever owned a hair dryer I've liked more. Granted, this is only my third one ever, but still, not too shabby."
"Compact, easy to hang and reliable. Very powerful for the size. Would recommend this to anyone needing a small hair dryer."
this is my 2nd purchase of this product I wore the first one out after 11 years ! it still worked but the black cover blocking the heat would no longer stay on. I love this hair dryer it leaves my hair so soft no frizz ! Well worth the money ..one of those cases you get what you pay for!
"Light weight and efficient.  Very easy to use.  Just what I wanted for travel, when I don't want to take my big heavy dryer."
"This hairdryer is very nice, I have full thick hair and it will have it mostly dry in about 2 minutes, I have also managed to drop it about 20 times since I got it and its still running like a  champ."
"I wanted a blow-dryer with a lot of power, but without a lot of noise.  This styler delivers on both counts.  There are two heat settings - the warm setting is not much higher than room temperature, and the hot setting is very warm.  There are also two power settings - low is just enough to dry without tangling, and high is perfect for pulling hair straight on a round brush.  The styler is not overly loud, and more importantly, it is without that annoying whine you get with some blow-dryers.  I have no idea if the &#34;Ionic&#34; part of it has any merit, as I haven't noticed that it dries my hair any faster or with less damage.  I have lots and lots of fine-textured, moderately curly hair, and this styler does a great job."
"I don't style my hair with a dryer, I just blow it for volume, then use the curling iron if I'm in the mood.  My previous one was dying, and I've found most of the dryers today to be big and heavy, with smallish nozzles for a more concentrated flow for styling.  They take forever if you just want to blow your long hair dry.  This is that same model as my last one, only with half-again more power. And it's very compact and lightweight, with a large nozzle for lots of airflow.  It's also quieter than most the big ones I've tried and given away.  Love it, love it, love it."
"Purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory.  This is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old.  My old unit works great, but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling, creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath.  We have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied so we expect the same performance from this new unit, also, the new one looks so much better, 10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too.  The company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great, we are very satisfied."
"I have only used this dryer once, but it works very well.  My hair is fine so it doesn't take long to dry so this dryer does the job quickly.  All in all, I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others."
This blowdryer is really powerful. I love it. I get my hair dried in half the time. I used to have a portable blowdryer that had half the power. What a difference a good blowdryer makes to a readying process! This thing is saving me time.
This dryer is literally the best hair dryer i have ever used. I watched youtube videos on the product before i purchased it and no one had anything bad to say about the item. I would highly recommend that anyone use this dryer you will find that it is well worth the price.
This is my second one. The first one has been  broken while moving home. I would say it is a product worth its price. Great deal.
"I admit, I was skeptical about whether or not this dryer would really make a difference in how my hair felt but it did!  I have noticed that if I use a<br />Higher speed than is recommended for my hair type, it doesn't make as much of a change but if I follow the proper instructions, my hair is soft<br />And shiny and the results are incredible!"
"Very strong wind produced by this hairdryer.  Dries my hair very fast, the cool setting defrizzes my hair after the wind tunnel dry:)  I have long thick hair and I can dry it in about 6-7 mins.  Great product ordered as a replacement after my old one (same hairdryer) died."
"This was my second of this hair dryer because I accidentally left my first one behind at a hotel. I love all of the features especially the cool button for that last blast to set my style. My hair is wavy/curly and I love the diffuser, my hair always looks good when I use this dryer."
"I didn't know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer. I have medium length, not thick but not thin blonde hair. It drys quickly, the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair. I am pleasantly surprised by my findings. Love the dryer!"
"Works beautifully and fast.  Lots of heat choices.  Hot is hot with this dryer.  I had to wear a terry headband around my forehead, ears, neck because of the &#34;leakage&#34; of hot air, but otherwise, it dried my curly hair very quickly, almost as fast as at the salon.  Love the thin case and the way the power cord, bonnet and air hose store in the case.  I worried about where I'd store this in a small apartment, but it's no problem."
it does eactly what it says it would do! I get so many compliments on my  long hair and it takes 10 minutes!!!!
"After my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it's &#34;umff&#34; I turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer, my hair stylist, who is a trusted friend even recommended it, and of course even she couldn't beat the price, it works really well, my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one, it was definitely time for an upgrade. The power is great and I didn't find it to be to heavy. I have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that's nice considering I'm a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn't have to much primp time in the mornings :)  I would definitely recommend this dreyer!"
I've only had this hair dryer about a month but so far it is excellent.  It is very powerful and  dries my long hair (complete with styling it) in under 10 minutes!  My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch as it's easy to accidentally turn it off while using it.
"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, other than maybe operator error. This hair dryer is great, it dries my hair much faster than my other Revlon which is about 3 years old and I love the different settings. I wash my hair every other day, so it doesn't get daily use, but so far so good. The cord will only retract well if you have the handle extended, if you try to fold the handle and then retract it wont work. It is nice and compact to keep folded in my bathroom."
"I received my leopard Babyliss dryer from Beauty And, and I believe it is the real thing - not a counterfit. The packaging, accessories, and dryer all appear to be very well-made with great attention to detail. The cord is quite thick and long; you can tell by the cord alone that it is a powerful machine. It is the best hairdryer I have ever owned and it dried my very long fine blonde hair in under 5 minutes, without much heat at all (seems like it would cause less damage to hair). It is certainly worth the $59.95 I paid for it."
"This is the 4th time I've bought this dryer over the course of a several years. It does fail at some point, but at the constant daily use it gets. Still very worth the price, it's quite powerful and puts out more heat and airflow than others I've used. Very happy with it overall!"
This is my second one as the first one got a short in it.  I love not having the hairdryer laying out in the way.  It helps keep my bathroom organized
"First discovered this brand of hairdryer at a hotel that my husband and I stayed at and loved so much that when we got home I went online to find one.  It is made very well, a little more expensive than what you would pay for one from walmart but that was okay with me.  I haven't always had good luck in the past with hairdryers but I think I'll have this Andis for a long time."
I travel frequently and love this hairdryer because the dual voltage allows me to use it anywhere and it is light to handle and small to pack in my luggage.
"Tiny, lightweight, but packs a powerful punch!"
"Works great.  I've had it a couple of months and still working fine.  Blows hard, gets hot.  Variable settings.  Long cord and relatively quiet."
I have used this dryer for years and I love it. Being a hairstylist ...we are rough on dryers and this one takes it to the bank!
"I thought it was a bunch of nonsense when I read this hair dryer did all these awesome things to your hair, but it actually reduces frizz. I'm not sure if all hair dryers do this or if it's just this hair dryer, but whenever I use it I notice my hair is a lot smoother and easier to brush through. I've had it for 2 years and no problems, definitely would buy again!"
"Who knew there could be such a big difference in hair dryers?  Well it's true!  This hair dryer is SO powerful, it dries my hair much quicker than other models.  I love it."
As long as my wife loves it...I'm happy.  She loves red and finally she has one with all the features she desires in a hair dryer.
"Not sure it's a professional grade dryer, but I have trouble working with the heavier ones so this is perfect for me.<br />Also, the price is right."
"Very compact, easy for travel packing, and works very well. For such  a small dryer, it packs a lot of power, and barely takes much longer than my full size dryer, to to it's job. Folds, and takes up 1/3 the space though, and comes with a cute case, and 2 attachments"
"Says it's perfect for traveling, and she loves the cold temp button for when she doesn't want the high heat."
My wife loves this hairdryer. It has multiple speeds and settings and even the hot setting doesn't get too hot for her. It's lightweight and not too big. Still easy to travel with also.
"Best hair dryer ever. Super high power. I dunno if it has something to do with the &#34;ionize&#34; part , but it actually thickens up my hair. I'm 46 and it's getting a little thinner up top and man this thing does wonders for bringing a fullness to my hair. Can't go wrong with this one."
I use the comb attachment and my hair is dry and full of volume in record time!  Much better product than I expected!
"We were looking for a good quality, simple hair drier. This one seemed to fit the bill.<br />It works well, dries hair quickly, and seems to help tame the &#34;Frizzies.&#34; We have been using it for quite a while now, and have had absolutely no issues with it."
"I had a dryer like this and after 4 years it died. Hard to find one like it, but Amazon had it. Perfect for drying thick wavy hair. This works so much better for me than the 2000 watt ion dryers. They frizz my hair. Hard to find a &#34;regular&#34; dryer. Thank younAmazon:)"
I did considerable research before choosing the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer for my wife.  She wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly.  So far it meets all of her expectations and we're very satisfied.  We are being careful with the retractable cord as others have suggested.
"I used this on my husband's back, and while yes, it hurt (HELLO, you're pulling the hair from the roots, of course it hurts!) it did a great job at getting all of the hair.  It didn't leave much of anything behind and I never had to redo any spots.  I did my husband's entire back and went through an entire thing of wax (although we had tons of strips leftover), just so you can judge how much you might need.  Oh, and it smells good, too!"
"Very handy for the grooming kit, you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry"
"I first discovered this little gem of a hairdryer at our condo. while on vacation near Orlando. I was so impressed, I ordered one when I got home and use it as a spare when I go to the gym. There's a lot of power in this little dryer; two speeds - high and low. I prefer high and my hair (which is fairly long and thick) dries very quickly and seems to wave extra nicely with this dryer. I love it!"
"The day I started using this hairdryer, I got compliments on how good my hair looked - no joke!  People asked me if I'd gotten a haircut and I had to tell them no, just a new hairdryer.  It's a powerful machine for how small and compact it is.  It folds up nicely to fit easily in a gym bag, suitcase or small bathroom drawer.  The cord doesn't retract, which is good in my opinion - my last hairdryer almost started a fire when the retracting cord frayed and sparked.  I'll update if anything goes wrong with this dryer, but I've been using for about 2 months now with no problems.  Highly recommend it for the price, value and functionality!"
"Great product, have had it for about a month now.  Seems well-made, love the soft coating, plenty of power, cool-touch button works well.  Only one slight negative... the placement of the temp. switch is right where my fingers fall on the handle and I always turn it to medium instead of hot heat, but a minor consideration overall. Got this with an on-line coupon which made it an even better value!"
"The drier is GREAT. I don't usually review items but this drier is the best one I've ever used. For the price ($23.66), it far exceeded my expectations. Although I had never heard of this brand before, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It has very easy to use speed and heat settings, the low setting is just right for my fine hair, but still gets hot at that speed (unlike the Conair I was using). It's not heavy, the 'ion' technology seems to be working.. My hair dries much faster, with less frizz, higher shine and so far with less damage to my hair. Results from this drier don't even compare to my previous Conair 255R. Also WAY better than a Bed Head drier I bought a few years back. Buy this one."
"i love this hair dryer, decided to get a replacement hair dryer because my other one was dying and it took me forever to dry my hair.  this hair dryer is not only great quality but it actually dries my hair in half the time.  it looks good and very easy to use.  the motor in the dryer is not loud and annoying like some hair dryers. my only complaint is that i keep pressing the button while drying my hair. but i think once i get used to holding the dryer from the bottom, it will be fine.  if you want a good hair dryer for a great price, this is it."
Great for traveling. It takes up very little space and weighs next to nothing!
Love this little blow dryer than has more power than my big expensive salon dryer.  Great for travel.
"I had seen these before in various hotels/motels. Last week I asked the maintenance person at the Place d'Armes about these units, and was told that they were very reliable, my favorite criteria.<br /><br />I ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day. They are unbelievably easy to install, and work flawlessly. No more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs.<br /><br />two thumbs up."
"I have been using these dryers for quite a few years and I am fully satisfied with their performance and durability.  My wife, who uses a fancy high power dryer has put hers aside and taking possession of mine. It is small, comfortable to use, dries well and it is quite dependable. You need nothing more."
I have very thick hair. This hair dryer works amazingly. And it's really convenient to bring for travel because of its tiny size. I love it and will absolutely buy again.
I am not very good at styling my hair but I find this dryer seems to be the correct temperature and has the directional stream going in the right direction.  Very easy to use.  I had used the dryer at my daughters and so decided to purchase it.  I would highly recommend it
I waited until I used the hair dryer for a couple months before writing a review.  I have medium length hair and dry my hair about 4 days a week.  So far this hair drying has held up very well.  It's light weight and is actually a little quieter than my previous Revlon hair dryer that died after 10 years of use.  I don't use the diffuser because it doesn't do a thing for my board straight hair.  For the money this is an excellent dryer.
Fast shipping. Works wonderful for my curls.  My perm was mostly straight and dead looking and just using this once with the diffuser made my curls come back to life and the dry damaged hair look go away.  I highly recommend this.
This thing is seriously tiny! So tiny but boy does it pack a punch. Hot air and blows as much as any conventional sized blow dryer. I am so happy with this hairdryer I'd recommend it to anyone.
"I just got me new blow dryer and I LOVE it. It is so quite and it dry's my hair in half the time of my old one, I also love that the cord winds right up."
"It smells good, is a nice texture (not too thick, not runny), and doesn't weigh down my long, fine hair.  I rub a bit on the split ends on any stray hairs - a great grooming creme.  A little goes a long way.  Cool pink pump container, too."
"I had bought this blow dryer in a convenient store and loved it!  I went back and purchased an extra one for my guest bathroom for company to use.  Our family has a lot of birthdays in March and I thought this would be a great gift for my daughters.  The convenient store did not have any of these left, so I went to my Trusty Amazon and bought two from them. All of our daughters have waist length to knee length hair and I have very thick and long hair and it takes us 30 to 45 mins with other dryers to dry our hair.  This blow dryer does my hair in 15 mins.  I love this thing!!  We don't understand how some say they get their long hair stuck at the intake in the back of the blow dryer because most women do not have knee length hair and we have never had this issue.  If you want a powerful blow dryer, this is the one for you.."
Great hair dryer. I like that it has a cool blowing feature because in the summer time I can dry my hair without heat. Works fine for me.<br />The handle is a little big and awkward to hold when I switch it to my left hand but if I hold it up at the top it's okay. The pros outweigh the cons for me!
"Its been a week I received this hair dryer and so far I am satisfied with its performance. It is very light and small, infact smaller than a fold-able hair dryer. Perfect for traveling. It heats up instantly and dries hair faster. I intend to use it outside the country and hoping it will keep up in its performance.<br />However, I think changing the voltage is not easy. have to figure it out.<br />One of the reason I am giving it 5 star is for Amazon's service. The price of this item reduced by $5 since the time I purchased it. I happened to notice it and called Amazon. they swiftly refunded my money. Couldn't be happier."
"Wattage not too high and just the right size.  It's small enough to tote to the pool in my gym bag, but large enough to do a great job at home, too.  I have had it a couple of years now.  It looks like it might continue to work--unlike so many other electrical products in this day and age of globalized manufacturing.  I cannot tell you hiow much money I spend just trying to get away from products made by slave labor!"
I first ordered on of these hair dryers about 5 years ago after using it  at a hotel in Maui. It's light weight and  works well for my baby fine hair. I always have a hard time finding a simple hair dryer that has the right combination of power and heat. The first one I ordered lasted about 3 years. I think that's about the life for this product since it does not have a removable vent/filter to clean. But...after trying a few others I went right back to the tried and true!
"Great power, compact shape, easy to use. This is for my regular daily use because the small size fits under my sink but is powerful enough to blow out my hairstyle every day."
Cheap and enough for normal use.
"Our old hair dryer has seen better days,so my niece picked this one because pink is her favorite color. Revlon is a name that's been involved with hair,so I said why not. The dryer seems to dry hair well,and my niece likes the color,so it's a win-win!"
I bought this for my rental and haven't tested it out myself but it's perfect for that.  Not sure about everyday use.
"First purcahse with the seller, delivery to Canada is about 2.5 weeks, and product is vry good, worse for the dollar spend."
I first tried this at a Marriott and loved the hidden cord.  I'm tired of multiple cords on my counter.  The speed is great as is the power.  It dries my hair faster that my old drier.
I think this is great for travel and at home.  You just sit and get your hair dryed and device is small enough to walk around with.
"Great hair dryer!  I have short hair and can dry my hair in about 90 seconds.  It also is small enough to not take up too much room on the bathroom counter, and is light and fits well in my hand."
"I have had this hair dryer for a year now and I love how quickly it dries my hair.  It also gives my fine hair more volume.  When I travel and use a hotel hair dryer, I can really tell the difference and miss my hair dryer!  It has a 5 foot cord and several drying options.  My only minor negative is where the buttons are located, I sometimes hit them when I grab the hair dryer."
"My daughter in law recommended this blow dryer, so I purchased it.  It dries my hair in half the time than my other blow dryer.  It's light weight and easy to use, yet powerful!"
Its a small blow dryer but it does the job great like a bigger blow dryer would.In this case size does not matter because it does the job.
"I love my new Rusk! It is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but it is easy to hold. The 4 attachments make any style possible."
"So since this isn't sold by amazon, I'm mainly reviewing the seller (Wish4Star).<br /><br />I received this order in a timely fashion (it's shipped standard USPS and so took a few days... maybe 5 or so). All the items in the pic showed up and the packaging was compact and secure.<br /><br />However, upon going through all the razors (great selection of blades BTW), I noticed that one box had been opened and a razor had been opened! Yuck!! So I contacted the seller and he assured me this had never happened before (I have a feeling he's telling the truth) and that he would send me a new box asap. Well I just received my replacements (yeah he sent an extra pack!), which showed up quite quickly.<br /><br />So all in all I trust this seller & had a very positive experience with him. I will most likely be purchasing in bulk from him once I settle on a single brand of razor."
Our blow dryer died recently. Panic!! But we just didn't have the opportunity to hunt around in local stores to find a replacement for the one we'd had for so long. I took a chance and looked on Amazon and there it was ... the exact one we wanted! It has a lot of power and we're very pleased with it.
"No problems and drys my hair well. There are only two settings, however the temperatures are great. The low gets hot enough and the high gets hot. The shipment was really a big surprise. I received this product within two days time from ordering it."
"I have owned one of these dryers in the past, and found it like many others.. in a hotel bathroom. Great dryer. Very affordable. I accidentally broke mine dropping it down an entire flight of stairs. Just replaced even cheaper than I purchased it for 5 years ago."
This hair dryer is by far the best one that I have ever owned! The price was definitely right! I love how quiet it is compared to other hair dryers that I have owned! It has three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cool button that you can press to get a blast of cool air. It dries my hair a lot faster than other hair dryers and it leaves my hair feeling softer than when I dry it with other hair dryers. I would definitely recommend this to others!
"Great for personal use and for one person using daily. It's got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and I love the retractable cord. I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren't super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I've had my dryer for months now and it's all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren't careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don't just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button. It keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area."
"good product, this the second one we have owned. Highly recommend this hair dryer, it is like the one's used in hotels. The first we owned lasted 12 years of everyday use."
"Really like this hair dryer.  Does not frizz hair when drying. Can be used with or without several dryer attachments. Like all silver color.  Controls are well placed and very easy to use.  Has really long cord which helps.  A little heavy (but I'm in my sixties) but its weight not a real problem.  Hangs up easily when not in use. Highly recommend this hair dryer.  Price reflects quality, value and great find!"
"Got this for my wife-she LOVES it.  Did my research on which hair dryer to get-and the power on this one is incredible.  Still noisy (all hair dryers are), but less so then some of the previous high end ones she has used."
Makes Blow drying so easy. I have very thick hair and the combs are sturdy. Easy to handle and does not get too hot.
I have frizzy and curly hair so it is hard to find a blow dryer than can straighten easily and quickly. This pro blow dryer definitely does the trick. It is strong and gets the job done.
"This is an excellent little hairdryer!  It is hard to find a hairdryer that produces more than a weak stream of air, and this one certainly does!  It blows lots of air and dries your hair really quickly.  I've had mine for about a year, and it is still going strong.  I just bought my mother one for her birthday (she loves it), as well as a second one for myself for travel."
"Good basic hair dryer.  Like all the rest prolly won't be handed down to my grandchildren, but serviceable."
"I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don't like this dryer.  When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  Otherwise, it's a great little dryer."
"This is a godd little hair blower--no ions--which I don't want since I need bulk, not flat.  I gave one to a friend who doesn't have too much money and she loves it too.  I'm leaving them at my nieces' (three) homes so I have a reliable, good hair blower whenever I visit them."
"I love the hair dryer, fits the wall perfectly, cord is long enough & hangs on hook when not in use.<br />For the ones that do not like the night light on the base, you can push the test button which will turn the light off.  Then push the reset button to turn it back on &/or to use the dryer."
"I bought two of these, one for each upstairs bathroom. The arrived quickly and at first glance, I was intimidated about installation. Then after reading the instructions, and seeing that they actually include a paper guide, you just tape to your wall and drill holes where the dots are... I installed both of these completely by myself! (I am a stay at home mom, so that IS a big deal!) It took no time and they both were up! They brace very solid against the wall. The dryer worked quite well and was very quiet compared to our old dryer. It also has automatic shut off, you can even hang it up while it is on and it will shut off as it is put back into the cradle. VERY NICE! I would buy again in a heartbeat!"
"I love my hair dryer.  I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  I saw a few negative reviews about the quality.  So since mine is pretty old, I can't vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  I've been super lucky with mine.  It gets daily use if not more. I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst has worked well for be. My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don't retract. I keep it clear of lint and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  I hope everyone has the excellent experience I have had.  Everytime I look at a Revlon or Conair hair dryer, I cringe. I've never had one of those last more than a year. After 10 years, I would purchase this product again, but mine just doesn't want to die just yet!"
"First of all, let's put things in perspective -- I am not a stylist.  I don't use a blow dryer to style my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!<br /><br />So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.<br /><br />I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.<br /><br />But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.  What's better than that?"
"Love this hair dryer. For years, I had a terrible old dryer that wouldn't die. When it finally did, I was worried that anything new I got would be junky like so many electronics these days. I have had this hair dryer for about a year now and still love it as much as I did the day I got it. It dries really fast without being too hot to damage my hair. It has a satiny finish that feels nice in your hand too."
Just what I wanted. Light weight and the switches to turn it off and on and the intensity are easy for me to use. I have MS and have a hard time with switches.
"This is a very good qaulity hair dryer.  It is light weight, has plenty of power and yet is incredibly quiet.  Much better than a previous version that had the power but also the added weight.  The Andis 82005 closes the gap between merely a consumer product and a professional dryer, but retains a reasonable price."
I read a lot of negative reviews on this dryer. I love it! It's lighter  weight than the older model and low noise. Drys my hair fast without being so hot that it burns my hair!!
"This hair dryer works great. I have long thin hair and I am quite happy with the performance of this dryer and its settings. The hot temperature is hot without being too burning, and the high blows just the right amount of air. I actually like using the hair dryer with the concentrator on it and that's something I haven't been able to say about any of the last other models I've owned. I also feel like it dries my hair without leaving it frizzy, but there is only so much I can judge on that since my hair is long, thin, and straight. Overall, very happy with the product!"
"I've never had it in me to buy an expensive blow dryer, so I'm no expert on dryers. But I'm very satisfied with this one. Very powerful and  you can't beat the price"
We bought this for our rental property and it works very well.  I would highly recommend it to anyone for your home or rental property.
"Excellent hair dryer for a low price;  I have 2 of these dryers;  They easily fit into a gym bag, get the job done and is very simple to operate;  You can't go wrong with this dryer"
I love this hair dryer - ergonimically balanced and dries hair fast. No high pitched whining noise like my old hair dryer.
The best l have ever used.  Can see and feel the difference in the way my hair styles after drying.  Not too heavy and the controls are placed conveniently to enhance changing the temp and air velocity.  Reasonably priced and with Amazon Prime-----no tax and free 2 day shipping....hard to go wrong.
A bit on the heavy side but very well made.  Wide range of heat and blower settings.  Works great!  When was the last time that you bought an electrical appliance for under $30 that had a FOUR YEAR WARRANTY???
"This small dryer really does its job.  I relied on other's reviews which were extremely helpful.  The most expensive product is not necessarily the best product, and this one proves it.  Great value."
"I love this hair dryer!  It is quieter than my older Conair.  It has nice speed/temperature settings that blow dry quickly without as much damage. I can dry my below shoulder length hair with the medium heat/air setting in less than 10 minutes. My hair is soft and easy to style, plus attachments stay on tight. I will buy Remington from now on."
"I am not a salon styilst, just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime, even at midnight if it is when the time is available. I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).<br /><br />One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).<br /><br />After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.<br /><br />The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always. I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.ds, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback.

"It's is awesome, made my life easier and I don't have to go to the parlor every week as I was doing before. I have curly hair, with this product Im able to blow dryer well and style with my flat iron. The only negative about it  is the little attachable brush, not good quality, I used once and its gone, needs a replacement. The combs are fine!<br />Overall I recommend the product, It was a great addition.<br />Rose Rosa"
I am always traveling and needed something light weight and small. After reading other reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I love it. It's very light and small. It also comes with a travel size bag. It doesn't tangle your hair. Very good dryer for those who's always on the go or even if you're not and you want something light and small!!!
"The best, hands down! My long, thick, naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight! I use this in conjuction with the revo styler, resolve or lavei shampoo. I also use sleek look or sleeking conditioner. Then I finish sparingly with my own version of Ojon oil.    Even other Andis blow dryers can't touch the performance of this one. Neither can the other way more expensive blow dryers."
"I just got mine today and to test it I decided to do my sister's hair ! So When i open the box let me tell you I didnt expect it to be so small . However , according to the description it was said to have more power . I told my self I'll be the judge of that been that I had the twin turbo 3200  so I said this one should deff do better . So I did her hair & finished it very quickly actually  and I can say the hair was very shinny, the size did not have anything to do  with the power this blow dryer provided!!! So I am pleased with the results the hair was very soft and like glowy which never happened with the other dryer !"
"I bought this dryer about a month ago exclusively for travel, but I like it so well that I've been using it for my regular one.  I like that the retractable cord keeps my counter looking uncluttered, but it doesn't always retract as easily as it should.  I sometimes have to coax the cord back in the handle, but to me, it's a tolerable hassle (especially for the price point).  The dryer is very powerful.  I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  Overall, it has a few flaws, but for $19.99 it's a heck of a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have had this over a year now and it's still going strong after daily use.  Love this thing!"
"Needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while.  I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now."
"This hair dryer is awesome. Dries my hair in 10 min. and leaves it smooth! Other dryers I've tried either overheat before I'm done drying, or take at least double the time.<br /><br />I actually had to order one for my mother after she tried mine."
Bought this to replace my (extremely) old dryer. This thing is fantastic. It now only takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair (after its air dried for a while but still) and gotta love aa product that supports such a good cause.
"It's powerful, not too loud, and not as heavy as people seem to say in other reviews.  Very efficient and does a great job."
"Exactly as described - so small!  When it arrived, I thought it looked like a toy, but this little dryer works!  Just used it traveling and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms.  Doesn't weigh a thing, takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers.  Great decision!"
"I have been using this product for nearly a month now. From a guy perspective I think this product is really great. I use this product since my hair is quite long and for some personal reason I don't like to dry my hair using my towel. Anyway, the best thing about this hair dryer is that it dries my hair really fast and also produce low noise. Well, if you use the high air mode, the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products I have used. Basically I just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn't too hot.     Furthermore, when you first use this product, it will have a burning metal smell (like soldering smell). However, after 3-4 times of use the smell will be gone. The smell won't stick on your hair though, so it isn't a big deal. This hair dryer is light which I think is a plus."
"Why does this little compact travel dryer work better than my bigger more expensive hair dryer? Which I've put away in the guest bathroom. This is a great little dryer. I wish it had a quick cool shot button, but I wouldn't avoid buying it for that reason."
"This has been a favorite perfume of mine for a long time.  Many years.  Spicy floral aroma, not too strong.  The problem is that Oscar de la Renta no longer makes this scent, so essentially we're buying what was manufactured ?? years ago.  Eventually there will be no more.  And eventually I suspect the remaining bottles will not be as full-scented as they once were.  That also means you can't get the lotion or dusting powder anymore.<br /><br />So get it while you can... or not, because I'm still using it and don't want to run out!"
"I had purchases matte polish previously so i know that it doesnt last as long, but its better than what other reviews are saying. I love the color and the matte finish is great! I have been wearing it for 4 days and no chips so far! You just have to put one thin coat on and it wont come of in huge flakes."
"It is a little loud, but overall it works great."
"My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one. I am so glad I did. This blow dryer dries my super thick, long hair way faster than any other blow dryer. And I think it looks shinier and straighter too. The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments. The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn't get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron. (I wish they had the retractable cord too!). And the cord doesn't retract too fast and hit you in the hand. Great, salon-quality blow dryer for a fraction of the cost."
I've been using this little powerhouse since 2002 and just now on my third Conair. It Last's a long time and was thankful it was still around so I purchased two this time. Just make sure you turn the air intake cap counterclock wise to clean out the lint that's caught on the grate or it becomes to hot. It get's very hot already but I've never had one burn out like other brands.
"Confession time: I am not a man. I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews. For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair. Now I'm going to buy one for my daughter-in-law!"
"This hairdryer work exactly like it was described. All features work as expected. Comfortable to hold, not to loud and cord retracts just fine. Would definitely recommend."
Works perfectly to dry my curls without frizz & in half the time of my old hairdryer...perfect size and weight for me.  Love the bright red color too.
I had one of these hairdryers for several years and had to get another when the old one quit.  Easy to use.
"Taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer, I have no complaints. It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm."
i have curly hair. After being without a blow dryer for a long time i decided to by this one. i love thats its pink and a donation is made for each one sold but it also is the best blow dryer ever. i use the medium setting and my shoulder lenght hair is completely dry in just a few minutes. then i either straighten my hair  with my flat iron or add a little leave in conditioner spray to wear it curly. its easy to use and light weight and doesnt get too hot and fry my hair.
"I have used this model for many years. When one wares out I buy another. It does not last supper long, but works well for me at a very reasonable price. From experience, it works as well as anything else in this style and price range. I hope they never stop making this model."
Prefer this dryer for many years as it isn't too small to handle but large enough to hold and direct in drying hair. For medium size it is lightweight. I don't use the attachments for my shorter hair. Dryer lasts for many years.
"Bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it. Powerful enough, not too noisy, takes up little space. It does exactly what you want from a travel dryer."
"I was looking for a quiet hair dryer that worked well & this one is perfect.  A little difficult to work the buttons one handed at first, but I'm sure that I just have to get used to it  -- i recommend it without reservation."
"Even though this is a &#34;professional&#34; style pistol hair dryer it's not  full sized  (it's medium sized).<br />It's best suited for shorter hair styles, otherwise it may take longer hair longer to dry due to less air flow and it's 1600 wattage (but it's still pretty powerful for a medium dryer).<br />It's light weigh and has a matte finish."
Teen daughters love this hair dryer.  Takes up much less room in their bathroom than a full size dryer and is much quieter.
"I am a 27yr old black woman and i use this dryer to dry my 20in malaysian body wave full sew in. it dried my braids completely so if you're wondering if it works for weave yes. I've only used it once since i bought it and once again to quickly dry my boyfriends boxers last minute and it worked for that too lol so im pretty satisfied. so far so good, thanks!"
I saw this in People Style and wanted to try it.  I have long thick hair and it cut my drying time in half.  It's perfect and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.
"i have heard about ENjoy products a few times, and it was recommended by my hairstylist. I still went out on a limb by ordering this pomade, but I LOVE IT!!! I have long straight hair, but after i blowdry/straighten it, it's still a little frizzy and i have flyaways. This pomade helps a ton, you only need about the size of a nickel, and you can use it from root to tip without it looking oily (of course if you use too much, that might not be the case).  Also, is smells SOOOO great! The price is good, i can see it lasting for a long time since a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with the same need as i had.  ;)"
"All I can say about this hair dryer is that my wife loves it. I purchased the very same one around 5 years ago. Well, it finally died, but since it was so good, I purchased another one for my wife. She says that it works faster than others she had before, that is comfortable to hold and obviously it last for a very long time. She highly recommend it!"
"This is the second one I've purchased (still using the first one which I purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond).  I like its features so much that I bought this second one as a back-up in case the first one quits, but it's still going strong at about five years old."
"This is my second of this particular hair dryer.  But the first one lasted 10 years which is amazing.  Since I couldn't be without a hairdryer, I bought another one.  However, I sent in the old one to Elchim for repair.  On their website it said the repair was $20.  That was correct and for $20 I now have a 2nd hairdryer ... not that I need it since this product lives up to the hype.  This is the hairdryer my hairdresser uses and swears by.  I highly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer!"
"I LOVE THIS DRYER, BECAUSE HAS SEVERAL DRYING SETTING, COOL, WARM, OR HOT, HIGH , LOW, NEGATIVE ION, NETURAL ION,  My husband mention how quiet  this blow dryer is to use and how fast it dries the hair."
I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.<br />I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.
"This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time.  It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum).  It is a perfect size for the bathroom.  The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang.  That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer."
"Way better than my previous dryer. I was cheap. I was trying to save money for a while... in the worst ways possible. I ended up buying this $11 dryer because it was cheap.  And for a year, I went around with wet hair. I tried to tell myself that it was okay because of all the money I was saving. But it did not feel okay. I finally ended up getting this dryer though and it was like night and day. This dryer works so quickly. It makes you save time and time is the most precious resource of all. It will dry hair quickly and efficiently.  I do not use any of the attachments that come with it. But if you style your hair, just know, those are options too."
This hair dryer is amazing- I just ordered another one for my daughter- She has super thick long hair and doesn't like to dry her hair because it takes too long- We just tested this hair dryer and literally her hair was dry within 10 minutes- Great product!
Simple blow dryer with cool function
This is an awesome blowdryer - it has cut my &#34;getting ready&#34; time by at least a third! Definitely recommend
"Nice, small compact blowdryer with alot of air flow."
I can't find this at my local store anymore and I just love it... so glad i found it here and bought this as a backup.  Works well and seems to last a long time. Have had about 4 of them so far over the years ... wouldn't use anything else if i can help it.
I loved it. It does the job that I needed done.I will not change to any other dryer as long as I can purchase this one.
Kept looking at different ones and finally decided on this one. I have hair I blow straight everyday so I need something that will last and so far no complaints on this one. Good output and a nice weight.
"This hair dryer is reasonably priced for the quality of the product. The sleek design, quiet operation, and versatile settings were what I was looking for in a replacement hair dryer- and this product delivers. I've only used it twice and am already in love with it."
This was so cheap but the product is NOT - excellent quality!!  LOVE it and use it a lot!
I recommend this dryer 100%. Really a good product. I dried my hair in only 20 minutes and the appearance was shinny and straight.
"I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair. I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &#34;sticky&#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS very inexpensively.<br />I did some research online and scoffed at the $150+ dryers that were being promoted. This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.<br />WOW. I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair. I styled it myself for a formal Gala event, and was able to achieve the shiny look, feel, and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve. It was unreal. Even on a work day I feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer. It targets the hot hair wonderfully and leaves my hair so dry, shiny and healthy.<br />I went back and ordered one to send to my mom! She is also a victim of ignorance-to-bad-dryer-itis, so I went ahead and sent her the cure.<br />Happy Drying!"
"Easy wall mount.  Plenty of power with two settings.  Easy clean filter.  The cord is a little short so distance from out let to mirror is a consideration.  Overall, I would purchase again."
"I love this little blow dryer.  I use it to warm up my bed when it is cold at night.  (before I go to sleep)  I dont use it to blow dry my hair so I dont know about how it would work for that, but it works great for my purposes."
"I LOVE this blow dryer. It really is quieter than any other one I've owned. The attachments that come with it are great, and it cuts down a ton on frizz.<br /><br />I love that the handle folds up for easy storage, and it's really lightweight. You don't feel like your arm is going to fall off while drying your hair. It's also pretty quick. I have thick, straight hair that goes halfway down my back, and it takes around 10 minutes to dry."
"Had surgery on my hand so I needed something light weight, yet powerful enough to dry my very long thick hair. Took a chance and was surprised that the dryer was both ! Excellent price as well. I am buying another one for my daughter in law."
"Great price, sturdy, dries my thick shoulder-length hair quickly.  Not a quiet device, but well worth it.  Hair feels smooth and shiny, not weighted down."
"I chose this hair dryer simply because I saw in a news article that it was highly rated and I LOVE IT. Not sure why reviews are about the button placement and weight. I am like such a baby with heavy items and this is fine. As for the buttons, you get used to it after a couple of uses. Great product and it definitely dries faster and is pretty!"
"I decided to buy this hair dryer after sifting through consumer reports and customer reviews. I couldn't be happier to have the quality of this dryer at the price I paid. I have VERY thick, longer hair that used to take me 10-15 minutes to get completely dry in the past. I have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed, damaged feel I used to get with my old dryer. The ceramic/ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description. Love the retractable cord. I'm very impressed!"
"I've had this blow dryer for probably a little longer than a year and I absolutely love it. It's blow power is incredibly strong compared to most dryers (think hurricane vs gentle breeze). Of course, you can use the low setting which is powerful too but if you want to dry your hair fast, this dryer will not disappoint. It also heats up quickly, cools down quickly, comes with several attachments, and has a long cord. The only downside is that I don't like where the buttons are because the way I hold it to dry my hair, many times, I accidentally turn the heat onto cool without meaning to. I would buy this a thousand times over."
"Pros: Lots of nice features; fold up handle and retracting cord. Really does make my hair feel soft and seem healthier.<br /><br />Cons: It's not as lightweight as I would have hoped or some other reviews have said. It's also not as quiet as other reviews have stated, the noise is average, not any quieter or louder than others that I have owned.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with it, especially for the $25.00 price.<br /><br />Update 04/16/13 - owned for over a year and still going strong."
"Thought it was a little heavy when i first used it. I got used to using it and i don't think that now. It's very easy to use. Has 3 different heat settings. Has a low and a high speed. The cord keeper feature is great, saves a lot of space. I'd recommend this hair dryer."
Love it. It's more comfortable that the one one I previously had. Easy to use. At least I can lay down.
My mom wanted a small and powerful hair dryer and when she opened this on Christmas day she was quite excited!
"I have been using this for a year, love it.   I leave the 1st application on my hair for 40 min to cover gray completely. This will make your hair more reddish than the color of your choice so be careful. I use color black, so the finish is warm brown (my natural hair color is dark brown)   you will need disposable gloves and cap, and some plastic sheet to cover your floor."
"My daughter bought this for me for Christmas.  The color is generic, but I must say, it works fabulously!  A lot of heat, a lot of air, and I can also easily push a button for cool air with my thumb to set a curl with a round brush.  I can turn it off and on and off again to re-roll my hair with both hands, without it refusing to turn back on until the entire machine cools down 10 minutes later.  I can set my hair with it in about 5 minutes!  Electric cord works great with it, too."
"As far as wound care goes, this tape is mediocre at best.  The tiniest amount of sweat or moisture on the skin causes it to peel right off, rendering it fairly useless for holding a dressing in place.    The one area where this tape really shines, however, is in binding orchestral sheet music parts.  The 1 Micropore tape is absolutely the best solution I've found for taping orchestral music parts together.  It sticks just enough to hold the pages together perfectly, yet not so much that it can't be repositioned without destroying your parts.  It's extremely thin, easy to tear to length, folds perfectly, and doesn't stretch at all.  It's about as sticky as masking tape, but much thinner and much stronger.    I'm constantly being complimented on how my parts are bound, and it has everything to do with this tape!    Stop using Scotch or masking tape -- and buy this immediately.  You will not be disappointed!"
"I bought this hairdryer more than year ago when my last one lit on fire. I choose this one because I know the Babyliss name and I loved the pattern. The pattern IS actually as cute as it looks in the picture.<br /><br />Weight: This dryer weighs about as much as a weighted tape dispenser. It feels like a professional hair dryer and is not easy to break.<br /><br />Design: The cord on the dryer is somewhat rigid and unwieldy. It became easier to wrangle when I bought Velcro ties for the cord (On Amazon: VELCRO Brand - ONE-WRAP Thin Self-Gripping Cable Ties: Reusable, Light Duty - 8&#34; x 1/2&#34; Ties, 100 Pack - Black)<br /><br />Speed of drying: I can't say much here. After all, it is just blowing hot air, but I guess that I can say that it dries quickly.<br /><br />Temperature: The hot setting gets pretty hot. Not hot enough to burn your scalp, but hot enough to get the job done."
"I purchased this one after keeping an eye out for a compact wall-mounted unit for our small guest bathroom.  It fits in a tight space quite nicely.  Does all the things that a hair dryer is supposed to do.  Reasonably quiet and robust drying air flow.  A good purchase at a very reasonable price.  Would recommend for anybody looking for this type hair dryer.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000X2UCJO Jerdon First Class Wall Mount Hair Dryer, 1600 watts, 2 Speeds/Heat Settings, White]]"
By far the best hair dryer I've used and for the price is definitely worth getting one of these bad boys!  Make sure to clean the back every now and then just place against your vacuum hose to get excess hair and debris!
"This blowdryer is excellent -- it can handle my lion's mane of hair. It is light to hold, easy to  hold and use and high-quality construction.  The Fekkai salon on 5th avenue NYC uses these dryers which is why I ordered it. I will note that the cord is surprisingly thick and heavy compared to other regular retail store blow dryers, but it provides a generous length."
"I use this as my home hairdryer, not just when I'm traveling although the bag it comes with makes it perfect for that too. It doesn't have a lot of power but my hair is really fine so a lot of hairdryers seem a little bit of overkill for me. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with really thick hair though as it might take a lot longer to dry."
"I bought this for travel purposes and it has exceeded my expectations. When folded up, this hair dryer fits in the smallest places and isn't bulky at all. This portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer I have ever tried. The only criticism I have for this product would be how loud it is."
"I have thick, long hair and this was recommended by my hair stylist. It is very powerful and dries my hair more quickly than anything I have bought before.  I would highly recommend this."
"The old hair dryer that my wife and I used was old and started giving off a burnt electrical smell. While I was online ordering another product from Amazon, I decided to give the hair dryers a quick look. After looking at several, I chose this one because of its features and low price. I must say that we are quite pleased."
"I was looking for something nice but quiet. This isn't bad - doesn't have the high pitched sound some of them have - though it's still a hair dryer so quiet is relative. Both attachments are easy to use and overall very happy with this dryer, especially for the price."
"I was looking for a lightweight, high-power hair dryer with lots of features (high/low, warm/hot, cold shot) ... and this one surpassed expectations. It is very light and sleek, making it easy to manipulate and switch hands/sides of head. It is also very powerful without being overwhelming. It dries my thick head of hair faster than my previous 3 dryers did. I can't think of any criticism, except a curl diffuser attachment would have been nice."
The hair dryer is lightweight and dries my hair quicker than my old one.  The price was very reasonable. Overall I am pleased with the performance although I have only had it for about six weeks.  Its durability remains a question.
"It's powerful and with high efficiency. Just hope that it can continue working well for me for a longer time (at least more than 6 months.)  :D<br />By the way, delivery is also fast."
Initially purchased this for traveling since it has the ability to work with European voltage as well as US. I now use it every day. Its light and powerful. Highly recommend.
"It's everything the other 4-5 star reviewers said. My favorite part is the soft sound and the long cord.  And of course Amazons service is one of the best!!! Love Amazon!!    Update;  8 months after purchasing this dryer, I pressed the cold shot button and it would not pop back out! I was unable to send it back to Amazon for an exchange but they told me to contact the manufacturer and that it was still on warranty! I did and Onei Beauty made it simple! I send it back to them and they'll send me another! Voila! Done! I'm not sure how long this product will last, but feel confident that the company will take good care of me should it happen again within a reasonable time frame! Because after all I REALLY LOVE THIS DRYER!!"
"Yes, please and thank you! I'm so happy with this dryer. I have very thick, coarse hair (4c), medium length. This dryer beat my old Conair dryer hands down - it takes about 30% less time to dry my hair. The design is perfect - comb attachments slide in and stays in place during the entire drying process (my old dryer's comb would always pop off at least twice and I've broken two comb attachments in as many months). I also like the width of this dryer. It does get very hot so use a high smoke point oil like coconut to protect your hair while drying. Bottom line, this is a very good product at a very good price. I also got the Andis flat iron - my new dynamic duo!"
"I could not find a hair dryer less than 1850 watts in any stores, so searched the net and found this one.  It's great and doesn't blow the fuse in my bathroom (I have an older home with 15 amp fuses)  My old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt and now it seemed like no one made anything less than 1850 watts.  This is a wonderful little dryer...a space saver and does the job."
We have two of these dryers at home in Michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in Florida.  Small but plenty powerful.
"Cheap, but powerful enough to get the job done! It is smaller than a regular-sized hair dryer that most people use at home, but it is larger than those super-compact travel hair dryers. However, I will be using this on my travels instead of those compact ones because of its power and multiple settings."
I am a 60-something female and as you can imagine have owned my share of hairdryers over the years but I have to tell you that this is the best and a real bargain at the price!  I am ordering more for gifts.  It is very lightweight and the fastest dryer I have ever owned. My only regret is that I did not find this one years ago.  You will not be disappointed with this one.
I never realized that spending a little more on a hairdryer could be so worth it. Cut my drying time in half. I've just never even thought of ordering a higher end hair dryer. Glad I finally wised up!
Good hairdryer for the price. Some hair dryers really make my color treated hair look dry and frizzy. This one works well with my hair type to keep it looking smoother than the average dryer.
Can dry hair faster than the other of the same voltage I ever used.  A good compact hair dryer!
this product dries hair efficiently and quickly. It includes 2 heat settings and a cool boost button just like the more expensive models.
"I have used this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with this hair dryer.  It was not overly expensive and works very well, quickly drying the hair."
"I am verry happy with Body Time Spray-On Natural Body Moisturizer!    I was a faithful user of Nivea Spray-On Moisturizer for several years. Unfortunately, Nivea discontinued this product.    After an internet search, I located Body Time Spray-On Natural Body Moisturizer, and immediately ordered two bottles.     In my opinion Body Time is better than Nivea. I will continue to purchase this product, and I have recommended it to my girlfriends.    Renate Wagner"
"I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2.  I tried to find locally, but couldn't find any from this manufacturer...but was tired of NOISY, HEAVY hairdriers!  This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot.  It is also very attractively styled.  No regrets."
"I don't put a lot of fuss into my hair, but recently we moved to a much different climate (hot and humid). Since I didn't want to wait all day for my hair to mostly dry, I wanted to pick up a cheap hair dryer. For the price, this one is fantastic. The hot setting is a bit hot (but aren't they all?) but the cool setting is really strong, so I use that most often. For all the power it puts out, the dryer is small too, which is great.<br />If I had to make a complaint, it would be that the cord could be longer, and it isn't coiled so it doesn't stretch at all."
I couldn't live without it!
"This hairdryer is the best I've had yet.  Its not too noisy, its not too weak or too strong and is very lightweight.  I blow dry my hair with a brush and it takes about 15mins and because its so light my arms never get tired.  I would buy it again."
"This is my second 209R.  When my first one finally expired after around five years of daily use, I knew that I wanted another just like it.    This dryer is wondefully efficient, lightweight and has the cord-keeper feature that makes it very easy to store.    Very highly recommended."
"I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol). Standard hair dryers max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry. It's amazing. I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie's and keep my hair style set. Not that hair that long has much style.    It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out. The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug. So I'm easily able to plug in else where an still reach the bathroom.  I'm thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal, closer to five. Every minute counts when your getting ready."
"Powerful, and quiet. It doesn't have that high pitched whine. It doesn't get super hot and doesn't have to because it's powerful enough. Other dryers would make my hair hot to the touch or burn my hand. My hair seems to be healthier and smoother after using this for a couple months too!"
"With three teenage girls in the house, the hair dryer gets a lot of use. A LOT OF USE. We've blown through quite a few hairdryers - no pun intended. This one however, seems to be the clear winner. As a stylishly bald man, I can't personally vouch for it, but the female testimonials are unanimous... this is an excellent product.<br /><br />Full disclosure: the dog isn't a big fan, but she doesn't like baths much either, so can'r be surprised."
"I wasted so much money on a few hair dryers, I wish I would have ordered this one first, its a really great hair dryer"
This is a good ceramic hair dryer for the money.  The retractable cord is a bonus.  Don't expect a $20 dryer to last forever so treat it gently and it will last a long time.
This is a small powerful hair dryer. It fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color. Our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite.
"This had terrible reviews but it was the only one I could find with the 3 things I wanted: diffuser, retractable cord, and folding handle. I figured for the price it was with a try. I'm so glad I did because I love it! I don't understand the negative reviews. It dries my hair quickly and my very curly hair looks great!"
"I suppose some people are never satisfied. I read all of the reviews and was amazed at the detail some wrote. For the price and good quality of this hair dryer I continually am amazed at some of the comments. It drys hair better, it doesn't, it's heavy, it's light WTF? The dryer works as well as any my family have had in the last 30 years. It drys hair--That's it. If you want to spend hundreds well, be my guest. As usual, fast delivery, good price and free shipping in certain cases and always a pleasure to shop on Amazon. Buy it--you'll like it! or don't ?? dang!"
This hair dryer works extremely well and is easy to handle.  The price is very reasobable.
This was a gift and I couldn't have chosen a better product myself.  I am able to dry my hair in about half the time w/o a lot of frizz.  It is light-weight and the placement of the controls are perfect. No accidental control switching while holding and styling.  Never heard of this company but you won't be disappointed.  Give it a try.
this t3 is easy to use and much lighter than other dryers. it dries faster and leaves the hair shiny.
great dryer-----love the diffuser that comes with it.  Not too expensive and it's lightweight and compact.  very highly recommend
"This hairdryer works particularly well for my fine hair in that it does not &#34;overcook&#34; it as there are multiple settings to choose from. You can choose from 3 heat settings as well as 3 force settings, and lastly there is a &#34;cool shot of air&#34; setting. All of these options have allowed my frequently highlighted hair to remain somewhat healthy looking as opposed to the blowdryers that use maximum heat all the time. I would definitely recommend."
"I really love everything about this hair dryer.  It is fast, has lots of settings, and black with PINK TRIM.  It is a little heavy, but it works so well I don't care.  I am thinking my old, cheaper hairdryers were too light and could not get the job done.  This cost a little more, but I am totally happy with it.  Get one!"
"I love this hairdryer!  I've had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny!  My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn't find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I've had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It's fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don't have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!"
I have thick hair and this baby gets my hair dry quickly and WITHOUT frizzies! Love it!
"This is worth the money.  Don't waste your money on the cheap ones, spend a little extra and get one like this that is good for your hair."
"I discovered this hair dryer at a hotel I was staying in and loved it. After I got home, I went on line and found it at<br />Amazon for a really good price. It is small enough to pack in a suitcase without taking up much room. but heavy duty<br />enough to handle my thick hair. I love it."
This dryer is different than any dryer I have had before. First off its very light. Second it doesn't ruin your hair like normal dryers do with high heat. This still produces heat but not like the old dryers that will burn your hair off.
I travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage. It's powerful and drys my hair quickly without &#34;frying&#34; it. I've tried more expensive models (both Andis models and other manufacturers) but I keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others.
Does the job at an unbeatable price! I have very thick Romanian long straight hair and this dries my hair well and pretty fast. Great product and would buy again if I had to.
I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer. I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes. My hair is relatively short and fine. I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well. I like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand; I recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand. It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.
"After using the same blowdryer for probably 8-10years, I decided to upgrade to a new one. I have very thick (*VERY THICK!*) moderately wavy shoulder length hair. Due to my hair thickness, drying times were typically 30-45minutes. I wish I was joking. This dryer dries completely in under 15 minutes (about 10-12minutes more precisely). I am so thrilled with this dryer!! Can't say enough good things about it! I like the texture of the dryer itself, love the speed of drying and the cord is long enough to actually be able to use it! SCORE!"
I haven't used it yet so I can't say much.  I'm waiting till we move and I'll use it in the new house.
"I just love my new hair dryer!  My husband got me this after I learned that I have some hearing lost.  (Been using the dryer everyday for more than a month.)  The sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers I've owned.  What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren't disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  This is a huge plus for us.  This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.  This is an appliance that I use at least once every day, it's definitely worth every penny!"
I am so excited by this dryer. It much quieter than my old one and dries my hair super fast without feeling dried out.
"Twin switches for dual heat settings and dual speed settings - plus the blue &#34;no heat&#34; button.  Reasonably lightweight, comfortable grip, priced less than almost any other dryer you'll find at a store and yet works just as well, I think.<br /><br />Be a good steward and get this one."
Works extremely well. Dried my hair in a third of the time it takes with my old hair dryer. I recommend you spend an extra 20 bucks and buy this hair dryer instead of buying a cheap brand. It's a great deal!!!!
"This hair dryer was out of stock for more than 2 months. I even tried xtava.com to buy this hair dryer but to no avail. I contacted their customer service but they just asked me to wait so I waited and waited. I didn't want to buy any other hair dryer. I just had to have this hair dryer because of its 2200W power and nice design. Consequently, I ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months. But, after using this hair dryer today for the first time. I absolutely do not regret the long wait."
"Hey All,<br />I am not so blessed with fine, thin hair that unless its pinned up and perfectly coifed its a frizzy, fly away mess.  This hair dryer changed that! With its settings and cool air, I can dry it and leave it. No more constant pinned up hair. I can let my locks down! SO yes. I highly recommend it. Its not perfect, Its a little bulky and takes some getting used too (you might have to change how you dry your hair) And I don't recommend traveling with it. BUT for a good stay at home dryer that works like a charm, has easy to use settings I love it -So much that I sent one to my sister :)"
Works better than my more expensive dryers.
This is now my favorite hair dryer. I use it every day. It's so light my wrist doesn't get tired.
I have had the Remington blow dryer for 5 years but unfortunately I left it at my daughters home.  I have called a few times to get her to ship it back but she keeps forgetting so I bought another.  Love it just as well as my older one and looks the same except for color.  Found out my daughter loved the blow dryer which is why she kept forgetting to mail it back to me.  We both would recommend this hair blower....especially if you have thick hair like we do.  It works great.
"First bumped into this product while travelling. Marriott Hotels do a good job of equiping their Hotel Rooms with User-Friendly<br />Appliances. This dryer is no exception. Its' small, compact, hangs easily net to our bathroom mirror. My wife raves about.<br />Dryers usually burn out besause the user usually forgets to clean the lint screen in the back of the dryer. I have had this dryer for several years, cleaning it occassionally and its still going strong. There are several styles, check the model that best fits your<br />needs."
Performs as expected. Easy to handle.
Purchased to take to Mexico and it is quite powerful for a TINY dryer!  Doesn't take up much suitcase space.
I also started using this as my main hair dryer.
"I got tired of cheaper hair dryers burning out on me, so I bought this hair dryer in February 2009 - over 5 years ago.  I use it every day and it's still working great.<br /><br />The switches for off/low/high and low/medium/high heat are on the handle of the hair dryer, and yet luckily I don't accidentally hit the switches when I'm holding it.<br /><br />This isn't lightweight and it takes up room when traveling, but I still insist on bringing this with me on trips.  Very happy I spent the extra money for it because it's saved me money - I don't have to replace a burned out hair dryer every year."
"I love this hair dryer. It is quiet, but powerful. I used it to replace a Remington hair dryer that only lasted me a couple years. I'm hoping this one last much longer"
"This was a gift to my Daughter. Loves the pink color, works great she has used the hair dryer everyday since she has received it."
Does exactly what it needs to do. Solid and durable. Gets so hot makes you wanna smack yo mama. Buy it.
"I gave this to my daughter that is going to college and storage is a big concern.  She has only had this for about 3 weeks, but I love the cord storage feature."
"Have had several before, wife like the convince of being hung on wall.  This is our third unit, wish it was more durable."
Hardest blowing hair dryer for the price.  This is the second one we bought. Works great!  Can't go wrong. x
"This hair dryer is powerful, quiet by hair dryer standards, and has a solid quality feel to it.  I spent a lot of time researching different options and am happy with my purchase."
Dries my thick hair in no time.  I love it and wish I would have bought it sooner.  It's worth the money.
"I have long dark hair that is prone to grease, this dryer makes my hair manageable and makes it feel clean. I love it"
"Do not underestimate the size of this dryer. My goodness this dryer is hottttt. I have weave in my hair and I decided to wash it and lord this dryer dried the hair within 10-15minutes. I really really really like it and for the price, you can't beat that. What more could you ask for."
"I used this hair dryer while staying at a Marriott hotel and loved it.  My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  The folding handle and retractable cord make it easy to transport and store.  I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn't work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn't believe how quickly her hair dried......"
I bought this hair dryer because I have the larger version that I use at home and I wanted the same quality for when I travel.  This packs well and I love the retrackable cord.
The Conair 1875 hair dryer is powerful and quiet.  I'm very satified with this purchase.
"Most people would call this a travel hair dryer.  I don't travel, but I have short arms and don't like most hair dryers that have a long nozzle on the front.  When my last dryer died, I couldn't find anything like it locally.  I finally tried looking for Andis online and was thrilled to find this.  I hope it lasts as long as the last one did."
"I had my previous Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for a VERY long time.  My own stupidity was actually its undoing. I tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right, burning out the motor. Soooo I had to get another hair dryer.  I decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part. It is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside. I only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that. I probably got more than I need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell. It is the bees knees! Don't know what that means exactly and I am younger than that saying is....but it is kinda fun saying it anyway."
My wife and I prefer these smaller hair dryers over the large bulky kind. This dryer puts out enough heat and air to handle our hair needs. Its small size also makes it easy to pack for traveling.
"This hair dryer was to replace my wife's previous Conair travel hair dryer. This one is a little noisier than her old one, but is by no means a problem noise-wise. It still is much quieter than many she has used in the past.'<br /><br />The dryer drys her hair well and quickly. Plus it was a great price on Amazon."
"1) I can now say I own the worlds smallest Ferrari!<br />2) This hair dryer lives up to the hype!!<br />Not going to lie, I was skeptical at first.  I hadn't purchased a hair dryer in over a decade and the price was a little hard to swallow.  After some reseach and all of the fantastic reviews I decided to go for it.  I am SO glad that I did!  This hair dryer doesn't get scorching hot but gets hot enough and has power like no other!  My hair feels softer after using it and I don't even need to use the straightener afterwards.  I personally don't have a problem with the weight of the hair dryer and it's no louder than any other hair dryer I've used.  If anything I think it's slightly quieter than most.  What used to take about 12 minutes to blow dry my hair now takes 5 minutes, literally 5 minutes or less from wet to dry  (the first time I used it I timed it at 4 minutes 20 seconds!).  It is absolutely incredible and saves me so much time!  Beyond happy I bought this and I would easily recommend to anyone."
"You can't get much for $20 these days.  However, an Andrew Jackson will get you the Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 watt hair dryer from Amazon.com, and your even have some change left over!  This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.  Well, I don't know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It's really not a big deal and doesn't take much effort on the user's part.<br /><br />I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.  Overall, for less than $20.00 this is a real bargain of a hair dryer and I couldn't be much happier with my purchase.  Thanks for the great deal Amazon!  =o)"
"Nice little blowdryer.  We bought two, one for each bathroom.  They get really hot on low setting."
"Wow, this works really well for the price. It gets rid of frizz and is really quiet if used on the low setting (which I use). I have curly and EXTREMELY frizzy hair, and this helped it get smoother while also giving it volume that I love. Also, the price is pretty fantastic for what it does."
"Love this dryer, ordered with Amazon Prime under 12 , 2 day arrival and use just for my Wonder Wash and Vapper dry system, wash in Wonder Wash, wring, hang on dryers until near dry and hang inside Vapper last few minutes for warm towels, shirts, light robes, socks etc good laundry system under 90, no more laundry mats!."
"Having used numerous blow dryers in my business, I have to say this has been one of my favorites for so many reasons. It's lightweight and I can actually carry on a conversation with my clients without having to lower the speed...love the design! I highly recommend this product and would purchase again."
If you are looking for a lightweight dryer that doesn't create hurricane force winds this is the one. My hair is short/medium length and fine. I don't need a mega dryer that sound like an aircraft. This is a compact little thing that fits the bill. It is also a tad quieter than the typical 1875 watt dryer. Two settings high(hot) and low (warm)work great for creating a curl/wave with a round brush. Would recommend for short to medium length fine hair.
"This is a nice blow dryer. It works well, is very solidly built (somewhat heavy for its size, but that doesn't bother me). It is comfortable to hold and just the right size (medium...not to small or big). The highest heat setting is too hot for me (which is a change from my previous blow dryer, but tells me it has good heating elements), so I keep it on medium. For some reason, I thought it was black when I purchased it, but it is a very pretty dark plum color, with pink accents...very &#34;stylish&#34;! :) Oh, and I love the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature!"
"I love this! Not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when I'm in a hurry, but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places! There's a bit of frizz but it's not bad compared to what I've experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer. Amazing product for a curly haired girl!"
"This dryer was affordable and has held up very well. I use the flow narrowing attachment and even with daily use, I notice my hair is much smoother and shiner, and has less damage, than every before. I've been using this dryer for over a year without a problem and really love it.<br /><br />Edited to add: I have now been using this dryer for two years and it works just as well as when I first bought it. I would buy again if I needed to replace it."
"I purchased this to replace a 14 year old Conair sufferering from heating element failure.  The old I got for its claim that it was quiet, to use near my sound sensitive husband and hoped that this would be the same.  It is and more!  It does not claim to be quiet but it is.  It is delightfully light to hold too.  The 6 setting options work well.  I am more than satisfied, I now hope for a long lasting relationship."
"I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok.  I really can't say that the ionic action it's supposed to do does much for my hair, since I usually use both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn't terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it's ok with her, it's fine with me."
"I have wanted a new dryer for ages, but kept waiting because I couldn't decide on what to get.  This Conair is a great choice.  I never realized a dryer could actually be quiet & do such a great job on thin, flat hair.<br />The hair dryer is so quiet, compared to my old one.  My hair is smoother with no static electricity.  A really nice dryer.  The defuser makes my hair fuller than it really is."
"This is an excellent dryer! It is dependable and delivers the temperatures I expect, but the main reason I chose this model is that the classic squirrel-cage blower produces great air flow. I was never satisfied with the wimpy blowers on most of the other styles.     I bought two of these from Amazon a few years ago. Two, because I thought such an inexpensive dryer might not last long very long and buying the pair was a better bargain because the order qualified for free shipping. The second one is still in the box awaiting its turn; the first one hasn't failed yet.    I see several comments here about travel. While this dryer is more compact than many of the bulky styling dryers, it is neither dual voltage (switchable) nor universal voltage (auto-converting), so pack a converter if you carry it overseas.  I use a smaller, folding, dual-voltage model for travel (then find that all the hotels have built-ins anyway)."
"This was a replacement, I had the same one since at least 2005. It is very light weight with lots of power. Easy to use to style with."
"This blow dyer is the best and a deal at this price! I used it and it was SO quiet I couldnt believe it. It also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting. I have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft. I recommend this dryer. Its not a looker but it gets the job done. Whoever said it was heavy is mistaken, its not heavy at all. The comb attachment is great also."
"if you are a cosmetologist like me you NEED a GREAT hair dryer!  I have yet to come across a GREAT hair dryer! I have had 5 hair dryers in the last 2 years and they have ALL turned to JUNK in about 3-6 months use at my shop!  I figured that I would give this dryer a try since it had a 4 year warranty I could return it for a refund if it was the same OLE dryer as the rest.<br /><br />Boy was I glad I got this dryer! the drying time is cut in half with this dryer and I DO NOT NEED to flat iron the hair after drying to smooth the frizz (oh, did I say frizz?  sorry, this dryer does not frizz the hair!). You do not even need to use any frizz control products with this dryer cause the negative ions that this dryer produces really does close down the cuticle and cause a lot less moisture loss and leaves the hair shiny and silky soft!  This dryer is a lot quieter than most dryers!  I had a client comment Wow - This dryer is really quiet!  I did not even say it was any quieter than any other dryer.  I have gotten raving comments and have been asked where I got this dryer!  All I can say is I got it from AMAZON!<br /><br />I really love this dryer LUXURY OR FERRARI just does not begin to describe this work of art!  I highly recommend this dryer for ALL the hairstylists!<br /><br />I give this dryer an  A+++++++"
"I purchased the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 six months ago, and it was love at first blowdry. During high school and college, I owned a series of inexpensive, low quality hair dryers. Yes, after half an hour or more and some expletives, they did dry my hair, but it was always flat and without shine. I blamed my hair, rather than the hair dryers.<br /><br />At the warm heat setting and high fan setting, this FHI hair dryer gives me soft, voluminous waves in less than fifteen minutes. I never knew my hair could look so beautiful and healthy! I blow dry it immediately after every morning shower, and I use [[ASIN:B004461ZL4 Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil, 6.8 oz. bottle]].<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot! The first time I turned it on, I thought I had received a defective model like some of the other reviewers. But I had accidentally pressed the blue cold shot button found on the inside of the hair dryer handle.<br /><br />UPDATE (after one year): I still love this hair dryer, and it's working just as well as the day I purchased it."
"The Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is exactly what I was looking.  I had an old one that I loved but I used it so much, I had to get a new one.  One thing I can say is that my old one last a very long time.  I know that I will enjoy my Soft Bonnet Hair Bonnet Dryer for years to come.  I highly recommend this hair dryer to everyone who likes to relax while getting their hair dry."
"Works great for its intended use, especially for how small it is!"
"I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok. I usually use this and another dryer, both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn't terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it's ok with her, it's fine with me."
Exactly what I was looking for.....as it is only used when traveling and hair is short.  Light weight and folds neatly.
"This is my third Yellow Bird.  I keep one as a spare just in case -- air flow and heat are superior to any product (including the Conair family) that I've ever used.  I've bought them for both daughters, who will also continue to use them as long as they are produced."
Love it!  Lighter th!an I thought a dryer could be.  Lives up to it's reputation...dries my  thick hair in record time
"Our old Conair started making noises about a month ago so we bought this thinking we would need it some morning.  The old one is still running, with a little noise, but it is the earlier version of this one and we have been happy with it."
"I think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews. It dries hair quickly, but doesn't damage it by being too hot, nor does it make it frizzy. It is not too loud - it is not exactly quiet, but nothing dramatic. It is not too heavy either. And it's a good deal! I have had it since a month and I actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now, because my hair looks so nice now. (Well, not that I was a monster before)."
It has great power for such a little hair dryer.  I have very thick long hair and it does a great job.
"If I had only known what a difference a hair dryer can make for your hair. I admit that I love to buy beauty products, but especially hair products. My hair is colored/highlighted, fairly straight, but not thin. Lately I keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair. Little did I know that using the Conair Tourmaline Hair Dryer would solve that problem immediately. The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it's nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It's a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too. Ironically, I don't always use a blow dryer because I want healthy hair, but this dryer seems to make my hair look better. For the price and function, I recommended this dryer."
"I LOVE this hair dryer! I bought one for myself and others as gifts after trying this at a Marriott hotel. It dries my hair so fast and for the price you can't beat that! It is light and love the retractible cord. After a while you have to push the cord in yourself but I've had it for over a year and use it everyday so it is definitely durable. I wish it came with a diffuser and other nozzles like some of the other hairdryers but if your looking for an inexpensive but reliable product, this is it!"
"We bought it not long ago, about a month. My wife like it! it has all the features that are needed (hot/cold air, different temperature of hot, ionization that you can turn on/off, different speed) the sound is ok I guess. hope it will work for a long time."
Just what my wife wanted for the bath room. Just the right size to fit on the small apace next to the mirror. Was easy tp install and looks like a professional job of installation.
"Good speed and heat options. I like that the hair dryer is pretty small. My other one was huge and awkward to maneuver. The concentrator attachment is good. Every hair dryer needs one. The diffuser is scary haha! I have no idea what to do with it but whatever. It is apparently for creating volume, but I have thick, short asian hair so I don't need any extra volume. Cord length is fine. The back opens up really easily for cleaning. The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn't work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it's just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can't really definitively determine that. Anyways great hairdryer! :)"
Works well and the speed and temperature  adjustments are easy to use.  Well worth the small amount it costs.
Small but powerful.  Easy install and arrived on time.
"I always buy Conair Hair Dryers!  This one is lightweight...I like the different settings of the dryer..for me it works great...I have very short hair and it is fine, but you would think my hair was thicker because of this dryer and the small round brush I use.  Extremely happy with this purchase!"
"This little hair dryer was just what I was looking for!  It is small and light weight, just right for me.  I also wanted a dryer that was low amperage as my old one kept blowing the circuit! All in all a great price, too."
"We're in the health care industry, often times after our patients undergo MRI and other brain imaging procedures, they need to shampoo their hair. This product is just right! Works fast!"
"Can not enough about. Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect. OMG it is so true. I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn't gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false. Even me going cheap worked. Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands. This will get the job done. You should never use above 1800W anyhow. Don't forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well. MIRACLE worker.<br /><br />My hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way longer.<br />My previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.<br />This dryer takes my hair 10-15 minutes (maybe) with brushing it out.<br />My hair is soft and semi sleek.<br /><br />My hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK. This dryer made my hair wonderful. I was able to do things to my hair that I never have before because of it. So in love."
"With items like this, I think most of us are creatures of habit and prefer to use what we're used to using. If it's worked well for 45 years, that's a pretty good recommendation.  That's how I feel about these Revlon tweezers. Mine - which I've really had for about 45 years, I think, mysteriously disappeared recently.  Someday they'll probably just as mysteriously reappear.  In the meantime, I couldn't find a replacement, have never been able to use the flat-edged ones, and was reluctant to spend a lot of money on expensive tweezers that get somewhat mixed reviews.  Since the latter two categories were the only types I could find in my local stores, I was glad to find the Revlon tweezers here.  And you know what? As I'm sitting here typing this, it occurs to me that, now that I know these are the real deal, I'd be a fool not to go ahead and order another pair, while they're still available, just in case my new ones disappear anytime within the next 45 years.  I think I'll do that!"
Hair dryer works perfectly HIGHLY RECCOMEND
"I love the ionic conditioning feature of this hairdryer. It works! Other than that, it's pretty much your average hair dryer. I do keep accidentally turning it off because of the way the switch is located, but I expect I'll eventually adapt to that."
"Amazon sent product on time as promised. Dryer is a small, compact and powerful. The new black finish is nice ... not shiny black but soft matte feel to it. Gets hair dry relatively fast. Very good for use as a travel dryer or at home."
"There is not much I require of a hair dryer, just one that dries hair quickly and has options for heat and airflow level.  I'm not sure the high priced hairdryers actually perform any better than this one which costs less than $20.  Great buy in my opinion."
"I have purchased two of these blow dryers, one for myself and the other as a gift. The HSI works well, dries hair quickly, the controls are easy to use and the cord is longer than any other I have purchased. I have noticed that my hair is smoother than when dried with my last dryer, a Babyliss Pro. Both of us are happy with the HSI. I would purchase again."
I'm happy with this product. I have long thick hair that normally takes forever to dry. This makes it easier and faster to dry my hair. I'm very satisfied with the Andis Dryer.
"My old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke.  I hadn't researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I'm very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren't ringing.  I highly recommend the Remington hair dryer."
"I've been using hair dryers since 1975, and this is by far the best I've ever owned. It reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed: moderate heat but high air flow. That's the correct way to do it. (The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don't know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can't vouch for the cord's durability, but I see no reason it wouldn't hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I'd still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I've put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul. It is far, far above anything I've seen in the stores since squirrel-cage motors disappeared some years ago."
"I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it. Having crazy curly hair I am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair. I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair and I barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane. Not only that, but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job! It's an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again I wouldn't hesitate buying another Onei MK-II Air Ionique. And to boot it's a fabulous Christmas present!!"
"This is a worthy product from a notable seller.  The customer service is superb, shipping is quick, and the minoxidil solution has offered personal results that I haven't seen with 5% solutions.  I've used other 15% solutions, and this is the one I choose by preference.  The Azelaic Acid is a theoretical DHT inhibitor (testosterone conversion to DHT production is the absolute cause of the hair follicle demise....aka hair loss), and combined with the 15% minoxidil mixture, the solution offers the possibility of solid regrowth .  Honestly, I've used this product (in combination with additional regrowth methods) and am receiving results that I have not had in the past using other regrowth combinations (I've used this 15% solution for roughly 5-6 months).  I began thinning in my early 20's and by 25 was shaving my head (which, I didn't mind so much but wasn't completely doing so by preference).  I'm currently 29, and my hair is gaining the density as it once was at 18.  I recommend the product."
Mom was desperate for a new dryer even though she doesnt use the old one she has now.<br />But besides that this was a perfect upgrade.
"Great hair dryer . Wife loves the retractable cord and compact size. After using the hair dryer for about a year, the cord broke inside causing the dryer to shut on and off.  The warranty is about useless because after paying all the shipping costs both ways, it costs as much as buying a new one."
"It's amazing you don't know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one! This hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others.  My old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin, fine hair. This one only took 5 min! Love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel.  Works great!"
"This is my third Hot Tools bonnet dryer in 25 years. I love it: highly recommend it. I, too had the bonnet constantly unhooking from the hose but realized after the second dryer that the bonnet has a notch inside the ring that clicks to keep the connected to the bonnet. The dryer does get very but with 4 heist settings I keep lower it after 10-15 minutes then every five."
"Infinity by Conair Mighty Mini Blow Dryer is awesome! It's so small and lightweight I forget I'm holding a blow dryer!<br />Don't be fooled by the small appearence, you'll definitely get much bang for your buck with this one! I have long curly tresses and it drys my hair lickidy split.<br />Would Absolutely recommend to a friend (and to a complete stranger too)!"
"The initial reason for buying this hair dryer was to replace one that had died. My decision was based on price and product name and couldn't give a hoot about the ION feature. After a few weeks of use the woman who cuts my hair remarked that my hair felt smoother and was laying different. Good to know that it wasn't my imagination. Also, I found that the nozzle is a lot cooler than my old Conair dryer. It's so cool in fact that I don't hesitate putting it away immediately after use."
"I've tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n' Hot (on  wheels & the bonnet dryer).  My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n' Hot dryers.  For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  Finally, I thought &#34;Amazon--bet I can find it there.&#34;  Sure enough, there it was!  I ordered it immediately!  I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  I keep the vent closed for fast drying.  I am a licensed Cosmetologist who uses the commercial/industrial dryers at that salon, but at home, I use my Conair...works just as good!  Thanks Conair and Amazon!  Never stop making this product!..."
"I had a smaller travel Conair for years and it just died. I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed. This little dryer is perfect. I have long hair and I don't like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful. I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it's small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn't get sore.<br />Also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad. Very handy.<br />Highly recommend this hair dryer!"
"I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  A bonus for me was the low noise level of this appliance.  I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability."
"I read the reviews on this hair dryer and decided to give it a try. Going on a big trip and definitely needed a small travel size dryer. This hairdryer is amazing for its size.  I have fine hair but a lot of it and this thing works great great, it's amazing for its size how much power it has. I have a very expensive Ionic ceramic dryer and this thing dries my hair just as well. I've actually even started using it on an every day basis and for the price you cannot go wrong!"
This was perfect for my trip.  Even when I did not realize I had to turn the dial to a different voltage in Singapore - it just flipped the breaker and did not burn out the dryer.  When I was finally smart enough to realize I needed to select the voltage I could not have been happier.  I have long hair and like to dry my hair upside down at times.  I hate when my hair gets caught in the fan.  This dryer had the perfect cover and my hair never got caught or tangled.  It folds up for easy packing too.
"It took me waaay too long to find a hair dryer that I didn't think was going to start a fire or ruin my hair. I decided on this despite some bad reviews, and am glad that I did. It's pretty (I know this isn't important to some people), and it dries really well. I haven't had any problems with it and love the accessories that came with it."
"If you are like me, the cheap cotton rounds shred when using them leaving annoying pieces of cotton all over your hand and face.  I've always paid more for premium rounds less likely to shred and they are becoming harder to find in the stores in my area.  These don't shred and have the choice of an exfoliating side or soft side.  Search carefully at Amazon.com to find the lowest cost.  I got mine for $19.99 for a box of 8 tubes and free shipping when I added another free shipping product that I also wanted.  I'm happy to store these until I use them given the quality and price I paid."
"Great little hair dryer that gives you what you need without being too huge or expensive.  Great for small spaces, after gym, people that MUST travel with a dryer, and I imagine, people with easy to manage hair.  This is definitely a no-frills, standard, and simple dryer.  If you're looking for low maintenance, low budget, easy, this is it!"
Well worth the money! I'm growing super long hair and this makes my hair so soft and shiny! I should have discovered this earlier!
"This is absolutely the BEST hand hair dryer I have every had.  I have 4B hair/natural,  and it dries my hair in less time and straight!  You will not go wrong with this"
I use this to travel internationally (so far just Denmark and Spain) and it worked fine with the European adapter. Just make sure to flip the little voltage switch before you use it!
"I have very thick and long hair and after having my old dryer for years, the motor was worn out and old. This new dryer is a perfect size, less bulky than my old one, and also very quiet. I don't get ringing in my ears due to the noise. It is not very heavy and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am very happy with this product."
professional grade in my home!!
This little dryer is my favorite.
I love this little dynamo.  I bought it for travel and when my home dryer broke I used this little wonder.  It works better and faster than any dryer I've ever used.
Love this little dryer. I want one for my bathroom. Using in my daughters bathroom but do plan to travel with it.
"Lots of power behind the air, cool shot button AND cool setting, which I love because my old one only had the shot button which made me have to keep it held in entire time if I wanted cool air......."
"A bit old fashioned, but I've had one around for years!  They work for me!"
I agree with the comments that this hair dryer works even better than the one I regularly use and is regular size!  I haven't used it for travel yet as I am still planning my trip to Italy -- I look forward to using the dual voltage feature.  And this isn't too large for packing as some have indicated.  The handle folds nicely and will take up far less room in my suitcase over my regular dryer.
"Great hair dryer. Blows hard & dries my medium long, fairly thick hair dry in 3 minutes. Love it!!!! Would definitely recommend this for any type hair."
"I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!"
"After several years of daily used, my trusty Conair 1875 finally quit on me.  Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!  So, I gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other Conairs before it."
Love this dryer.  Replaced my old Sedu one that finally bit the dust.  Leaves hair shiny and silky.  Dries in half the time.  Use on my pet on low setting.  They love it.
"I like this hair dryer because it works quickly, doesn't over dry my hair so there's no damage for using it, and it doesn't weigh much."
"I looked at local retail stores and couldn't find wall mount units.  Don't know why anyone would want one just lying on the counter.  I was skeptical of the Ionic feature, but I believe my hair feels softer and less straw-like after using this dryer.  Feels well made and should last.  At first I thought the high speed wasn't powerful enough, but I think the quietness of this unit is deceptive.  It's really blowing as much air as my old dryer, which was good, but it's so much quieter that you think it's not as powerful.  The night light is quite bright and is a pleasing green, but I wish I could turn it off during the daytime."
"It was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn't work. The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn't blow. I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding. Had to return it and didn't replace it.<br /><br />REVISED: December 1, 2015<br />This new review is LONG overdue.<br />NOT ALL HAIR DRYERS ARE CREATED EQUAL! I never knew there was such a difference a hair dryer could make on the styling of hair.  After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit. Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.<br /><br />After I received the replacement I immediately had to wash and style my hair. I can't believe how shiny and soft my hair felt. It's so easy to style my hair now. And it's quiet AND light.  If you're on the fence in purchasing this hair dryer, do not hesitate, buy it. I can't thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy. Sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated."
"Quiet and quick. My old hairdryer was a screamer and I got this one because I was developing tinnitus and everything I read suggested controlling decibels was important.  The buttons are right where you grip the handle, so it takes a little getting used to placing fingers so you're not changing your settings.  My hair is smoother."
"This is a nice, lightweight hairdryer.  Use this one over my old one all the time now even though I specifically bought it for travel.  Like the feel of it in my hand, and puts out less heat than my other one.  I recommend this dryer.  Does a great job on my short, thick hair and dries quickly."
"I am a former hair dresser of the 60's and 70's .All hair services were done with roller sets and a time under a hair dryer.So I feel qualified to rate this dryer. IT ROCKS! The heat and air circulation are great. Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use. The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer. Best of all,its quiet. Instructions for assembly are very vague. Just use your common sense and look at the pictures and you'll figure it out. I had mine together and running in about 15 minutes. For the money I don't think you could go wrong. The only thing I would change is the plastic legs. But what isn't plastic these days? Good buy."
Works better than the large one I have and is so small
Easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight.  you can take it anywhere in that house I usually watch tv while my hair is getting dry. ?1/26/2013
"I have been using it for 3 weeks now, every morning to dry my hair and I love it. The color is nice (red, not pink), it is not too loud, there are 2 speeds and 3 temperatures. I use high speed and medium temperature and it dries my medium length hair in a few minutes. If I use the high temperature, the drying time is about half. There is one feature that I totally love - the RETRACTING CORD - no more wrapping the cord around the hair dryer. LOVE IT!"
Im a dude first off. At first I thought it was real heavy then I got used to it however this is my first hair dryer as I am growing my hair longer. Ladies beware of the weight however it drys my hair very quickly its about 4 in all the way around right now and takes about 30sec tops completely dry. When you buy it there is multiple settings you just have to play with the two switches that flip up and down. NOT PICTURED IT COMES WITH A FUNNEL AND THE FUNNEL WITH THE COMB ON BOTH SIDES!!!!!!!!<br />Im 1 for 1<br />Take my advice at your own risk.
"This is a great hair dryer! Unlike some of the reviews I do not feel it is heavy ,but I have always used a full sized dryer as opposed to some of the more compact ones out there in the market. I did have to get used to the switch placement the first couple of times I used it, and the nozzles can be difficult to turn if they are put  on too tight, but these are minor adjustments one has to make while getting used to a new product.     My hair is noticeably straighter and very soft since starting to use this dryer, I don't necessarily feel it dries my hair any quicker than my old one  did, but the end results are definitely  better!"
My daughter likes it because it takes up little space in her drawer.  It is light and dries almost as fast a her precious large heavy one.
Very nice dryer.  It's not as powerful as ones I've had in the past but I have short hair. I don't think it would be powerful enough for long hair. It was my mistake not to realize the power level that was posted in the ad.
"I took this on my vacation and it worked wonderfully, so I purchased another. The bag will hold more than just the dryer, I threw in combs and a few other small items. I will be buying a third as a gift."
It has a lot of power.  Easy to hold and small enough to be easy to pack for a trip
This hair dryer works extremely well and folds and stores neatly in a drawer. The retractable cord is easy to use with just a push of the button.
Use every other day and after 3 yrs it is still going strong.
"after having my previous blow dryer for almost 6 years, it finally died on me. i did a bit on research on some blow dryers and to be honest this one caught my eye only because the color lol i read some of the reviews and went ahead and purchased it. it was suppose to arrive on a friday and i recieved it on monday :)) that was a plus, after usuing it I LOVED IT, it was light weight, small and came with a diffuser and another gadget. i have long thick hair and my hair was dry in less than 15 minutes and it was soft and had less frizz !! love this product !"
"i have limited space in my apartment..every inch counts. that doesn't mean that i don't want the best, and i have it in this teeny tiny dryer. tucks into one of my baskets when not in use, but when in use, works like a charm."
"it took me a while to find a blow dryer that actually made it easier to do my hair , usually my hair would still be super fluffy and still kind of tangled after blow drying . I have really kinky curls and after using this my hair was almost straight . I only used a flat iron so it would be sleek but this blow dryer really works . it made my hair shiny and straight and it gets really hot which helps a great deal. I totally recommend this blow dryer to anyone especially if you have kinky curly hair like my self ."
"I can not say enough good things about this hair dryer. I have long curly hair that took over an hour to dry. Now I can actually leave for work on time. My previous dryer was more expensive and not even close to being as good or as fast. No reason to ever spend more money again. I am a very satified customer. Without a doubt, I will be a repeat customer next time I need a new hair dryer."
"I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!"
I love this dryer. I use it as both my everyday dryer and my travel dryer. It's just as powerful as a full-size but without the weight and bulk. I'm seriously never going back to a full-size dryer again.
I have used many many less expensive hair dryers over the course of 30+ years and they often break within a year.  I have had this dryer about two years now and it is still going strong.
"I hardly ever write reviews of products -- I can't even remember the last one I wrote. However, I'm pretty inspired right now. This dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it's always been. It's not frizzy, so I'm not doing tons of follow-up flat-ironing. And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I'm finished.<br /><br />Now, it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up, but for now, I'm pretty sure this is the best purchase I've made in years."
"great for traveling. have a little trouble getting cord to retract but I haven't used it much, so should loosen up as I use it."
"I purchased this watch for a legally blind, elderly friend of mine. The watch is just like the one Radio Shack use to sell. This watch is far superior to the new watch Radio Shack is selling. It can be heard loud and clear, and it is easy to use. I would recommend it for any one with vision problems."
It is so hard to find a small blowdryer. I'm very happy with this!
This item arrived quickly and just as advertised. I love it.....it dries my thick hair in a flash. Try it!
"Not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price. It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I've never used (pinpointer and curler?) The 'cool' button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn't have a 'medium' setting but I don't think that's worth 20 bucks. If you don't like the color blue, well you're outta luck. Guess since it isn't foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it. The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer."
"My wife was looking for a high quality hair dryer for a long time. Finally, we found what she was looking for. Panasonic from Japan, product that trust :)"
"I've never used a pumice stone before so when I purchased this one and used it for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised at how it worked. My tootsies were soft on the bottom like they hadn't been all winter.<br /><br />I'm so glad I purchased this. Plus, the little string allows me to hang it with my loofah."
The hardest part of having your old hair dryer die on you is getting used to a new one.<br />This hair dryer is fabulous and so quiet compared to my old one!
"This is a great dryer. It blows hard which is what I wanted. I have short bleached hair. I don't use the attachments. I haven't noticed that the ion feature has done anything different for my hair. It has a nice long cord which I also like. Some reviewers have mentioned it being heavy. Not true, maybe for a three year old, but not an adult. It just feels like a nice solid, well made dryer. It's louder than my last dryer, but not too loud. I don't think that whole ion thing does anything no matter which dryer you use. My hair is the same, with or without ions. What smooths it out is the fact that it blows nice and hard. That will probably change though as the filter gets clogged inside. That remains to be seen. I'm happy with it."
Fantastic bonnet drier. Definitely worth paying a little extra to get a quality product. I primarily use this when I am doing a deep treatment on my hair.
"This is my second dryer. The first one broke in half.  I used duct tape to make it useable until I received the new one. The motor continued to work well.<br />I ordered the same model hoping I could use the same wall mounting.  But no, they had redesigned slightly and just enough that we had to remove the first mounting and replace it.  I like the convenience, but I would really like to see them redesign it with a few more features:  keep it compact, wall-mounted, but add a cool function and make it quieter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is very loud, even though they advertise differently.  I would recommend it as is, but would love those additional features."
Hair dryer was very easy to install and looks nice on the wall.  The design of base and cord holder keeps everything in its place.  The night light is sufficently bright for late nite visits to the john.  The dryer works sufficently and as expected.
"I have WHITE blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. I never leave home without mascara (yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too. I'm vain). I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!  I can now go to the water park, the pool, the beach, etc and actually have noticeable eyes without having to bother with waterproof mascara (that destroys your lashes anyway).    It was easy & fast to use -- start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes. If it's messy for you, you're using too much of the gel at one time. The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair's cuticle. Once that's done, it's just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto! Dark lashes!      Ladies, it only COLORS your existing lashes, it doesn't make them longer or thicker.  If you take your time and apply it carefully, you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes.  I colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago, and it's still going strong.  I'll probably do a touch up in another week or so. I'm very happy with this product. I wish I'd found it 20 years ago.  I can't imagine not having this in my beauty arsenal. Now that I've discovered it, I'll never be without it again."
"I bought this for an upcoming trip.  It is super lightweight and easy to use.  It doesn't have a cold shot but I don't need one.  It also doesn't have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  It is also perfect for her hair on low.  I do recommend this to anyone especially those with mobility and dexterity issues.  It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female's hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!<br /><br />Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.  I don't have curly hair, so I don't' use it."
Exactly what I was looking for!  It folds in half for maximum storage!  Easy to use and I am able to dry my long hair within minutes!
"I bought this dryer after much debate over its price about a month ago.  I had decided the price was worthwhile given how much more expensive it is at regular stores in the mall compared to Amazon.  Although it is still on the pricey side, I feel this was an excellent investment.<br /><br />I have fairly long hair that I blowdry every morning, and this dryer really does speed up that process.  It's true that the dryer doesn't seem to blow with much force, or with much heat, but it actually dries my hair much faster than any of my old brands (conair, vidal sassoon) with less noise and without me working up a sweat.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it indeed makes your hair smoother or shinier... I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.<br /><br />I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that."
"This thing is SO fantastic, seriously. I'm tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before I need a new one. It dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than I've ever experienced from a dryer. I'm notorious for showering at night simply so that I don't have to bother with drying my hair because it takes too much time in the mornings, but this dryer makes what is generally a lengthy and annoying process a quick, simple thing. The retractable cord is a huge plus, the folding neck is a plus, I really just can't say enough good things about this dryer. Especially for the price! BUY IT."
"Don't know the longevity of this item yet. But it's a must have for travel. On the Euro setting, low is high enough! I have lots of fine, curly medium length hair and it dried in less than 10 minutes. Yes, it's loud but worth it as a space saver and effective dryer!"
"I used this powerful, 1875 Watts, Dual Voltage 125/250 blower in Cuba last week, along with a separate plug adaptor. It worked perfectly, just turn the button on the handle with maybe a knife (or other instrument) to 250V setting, and use on high or low settings.<br />This is a great product for me, I don't like the blow dryers usually found in hotels outside the US (you need to continuously press on the power button to keep it on) because it's awkward scrunching my hair into the diffuser with my other hand. Also, the diffuser is high quality with twelve prongs.<br />It's not exactly tiny in size once it's open, but is slightly smaller than my regular blower, and it's great the handle folds.<br /><br />When travelling, it's the small conveniences that make me happy, and this blower did just that!"
"Best dryer ever.<br />I am able to dry my medium length, thin hair in 5 minutes. Not too hot and the cold shot works great for setting your style. I'm on my 2nd one of these in 3 years?I travel with this dryer so it gets beat up, but has outlasted every other dryer I've ever had."
"Highly satisfied with the hair dryer and the company. My hair is long and thick. It is every texture in the book. Some curly hair, some straight, some frizzy, some fine, a lot gray, all highlighted/colored. It normally takes me 20 - 30 minutes to get it completely dry. Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down. With this hair dryer I had it completely dry in 10 minutes. When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron. I live in the Deep South. Heat and humidity are a way of life. I can't tell you how happy I am with a hair dryer that cuts 10 - 20 minutes off the time I have to spend blowing more hot air my way.<br />Also, I have received two very service minded emails from the company. It is because of these that I was prompted to write a review.  A quality product and a customer service driven company deserve a shout out."
"Great hair dryer with 3 speeds, which is super hard to find!  (I have dry curly hair and really want a low speed and a medium speed.)  Also folds for travel and has removable concentrator attachment."
"Dryer was delivered on time.  It is powerful, dries my short hair in 2 minutes and isn't heavy.  Love it."
"My hair normally takes forever to dry, but not with this dryer. It  drys so quickly and will NOT dry out your hair. Worth every penny"
Works very well thus far.
I am small with shoulder problems and this is very compact and light weight.  It packs a punch with power!
"so far so good.  My husband ordered it, but we both use it.  Have had a similar  one before and used it for years.<br />Hoping this one last as long."
I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I have heard no complaints so far. Shipping was fast.
"Good solid unit.  Feels super well constructed.  I am an electrical engineer and appreciate the solid heavy motor.  This likely means it will last.  It moves a bunch of air.  It heats quickly and strongly without odor.  Does a terrific job on hair.  Noise level is quite low for the amount of air its moving.  The surface finish remains excellent after 6 months of heavy use.  My wife loves it.  The buttons are placed such that neither one of us inadvertently changes the settings during use.  Neither of use uses the attachments so no help there.<br /><br />While I stress the solid feel of the unit as a good thing, I don't feel it is too heavy and neither does my wife.  I guess it depends on your expectations.  It will probably strike some as too heavy.  Not us."
Powerful but quiet.
This thing is amazing. I was tired of using the crappy cheap one my mom bought for me and my sisters. This thing i hav seen all over youtube and can't get enough of it!
"This blow dry is awesome!!! It dries my hair so quickly! I have used blowdryers, but this one beats them by a long shot. I like that it is heavy duty and built to last. Looking forward to having this for a long time."
I first used this brand of dryer at  Barona Casino hotel. It worked so good I ordered one as soon as I arrived home. I thought it would be really expensive but it is not.
"works great for me, i dont need anything fancy but this one has everything i needed. the attachments help for random things as well"
"enjoyed this dryer for many cruises and wanted my own, Have not been disappointed!!  Powerful and tiny, delivers as promised"
I bought it for traveling but I use it all the time because it's powerful and lightweight. Definitely recommend the hair dryer and the seller.
Even better than the Revlon version i had before. Controls are easier to use and it isn't too heavy in my hands.
I found this is really worth for me.I'll definitely Prefer this drier to everyone. It dries hair    just within 5min.
"We've only used this a few times but we have not gotten sunburn at all and I can feel pretty good about the ingredients, especially for kids."
"I have really dry hair and this product really helps style and hydrate my hair. Easy to use, apply before blow dry. I noticed a difference the first time I used it. I have been using it with the Moroccanoil."
"This thing has unbelievable bang-for-buck.  It's compact, comfortable, and powerful.  If you need a compact hairdryer buy this one. You won't be dissapointed."
"This was a purchase to replace my old dryer - which was the exact same brand/type - of nearly 10 years. One morning it just stopped heating up, so I hurried to the store for another, but couldn't find anywhere! Thank goodness for Amazon ^_^ My old one was boring gray, so I really enjoy the new bright colorful look. And I did try other brands, which I returned, as no other dryer ever got hot enough to straighten my frizzy hair, so I'm really glad I was able to find an exact match here."
"I did quite a bit of research before pulling the trigger on a new hair dryer. I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works. I've dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons. Below I have compared the two dryers:<br /><br />Conair 173RZ VS. Vidal Sassoon VS501<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Pros:<br />Lighter and smaller than the VS501, which is easier on my arm<br />Puts out more air than the VS501<br />Folds up for easy storage and travel<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Cons:<br />Not as hot as the VS501, but still drys hair just as fast if not faster due to the air flow<br />Shorter cord than the VS501, which unless you need it can make it easier to store<br /><br />Overall Summery:<br />The Conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small, fold-able, lightweight design. The color isn't my favorite, but the fact that it meets all my criteria and I can take it with me when I travel makes up for it."
"My favorite so far. Takes less time to dry and is quiet. My original one stopped working after about 1 1/2 year, they sent me a replacement right away. I had the new one in 2 days!"
"I have been looking for a small, low voltage, hair dryer for some time. Went to Napa with some friends, and this hair dryer was in the Hotel. I used it, loved it, wrote down the name and found it at Amazon.com. Ordered it and it came within days. I have thin hair, and this is best for me."
"The first one lasted me ten years and passed down to my son still working. I really love the retractable cord, prevents clutter."
"While US Pediatricians strongly urge parents to leave the earwax removal to professionals, people in Asia do this all the time. I was able to see the earwax with the light and gently scoop out the canal.  The big scoop and the tweezers were too big for his 9 year old ears but the smaller scoop worked perfectly.<br /><br />WARNING: DO NOT try this on yourself or go too deeply in the canal.  It's long enough to do some real damage."
This dryer is average size nothing compact about it.. And it's not as warm as my normal one but it does fold up and I love the cord I usually turn it on high for a few seconds just so it will warm up a bit but the high is to strong to dry my bangs and hair so I turn it down to med.
Great size and does a good job. The detachable black diffuser piece is extremely hard to get off (at least mine was) so consider whether you will take it off and on often.
This just arrived and I've used it only once but my first impression was good.  It dried my hair (which has natural waves and can be difficult to dry/style) quickly and seemed more powerful than my last one.
"Awesome product!  Just what I wanted.  I have medium length, thick, curly hair that takes forever to dry, and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser.  I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  When I first received the product and removed it from the box, I was skeptical about its ability to dry hair.  It looks like a toy.  However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  It works great.  I use it every day.  I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  Finally someone who makes a storage bag where the product actually fits once the consumer uses it. (Unlike tents that you can never stuff back into the bag once you unpack them.) I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift."
"The blow dryer I had since high school finally died so I bought a new one. There's nothing special about this hair dryer, but there's definitely nothing wrong with it. Nice, powerful stream of air with the option of cooler air, hotter air - and high and low power. It works quickly on my fine hair and on my daughter's thicker hair."
"I love this hair dryer! I have long, natural hair. I used to blow dry and flat iron my hair until it started breaking and looking *dead*. I heard about this dryer on You Tube from &#34;Sista with Real Hair&#34;. I ordered and received it within 3-4 days. No more blow drying for me. Great Price too!"
"Before I ever used this product I thought all hair dryers are the same because they simply just blow air. After used my friend's Panasonic Nano hair dryer, I knew I was wrong. This is so much better than the cheap dryer I bought at supermarket. My hair wasn't at all frizzy with this new hair dryer. I'm in love with this product"
"Been using this twice daily for over a year. Simple, effective. You don't really need anything more than this to make wet hair dry. My dog would probably give it a 1 star review, but he is biased because he hates hair dryers in general."
I do my share of traveling with work and personal.  I noticed that I always used the hair dryer that was hanging up in the hotel bathroom.  I rarely used it at home.  I realized the convenience of ready to go made the difference.  No more cords to untangle before plugging in.  I am extremely satisfied with my new Andis 30975.  Plus now there isn't an ion to be found on my head.
"I wanted a smaller dryer for traveling and that would dry my curly hair fast.  This is a fantastic dryer.  My hair is curly and midlength and it dries in 7 minutes!  And it does a fantastic job of smoothing it out, even on my worse days!  I love it."
"I recently got to try this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised. At home I had the Sharper image 1875W quiet Ionic hair dryer and this is what I am comparing it to. I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place. Almost 10 years, not bad at all!"
"Worth it! I'm so glad I listened to my hairdresser when he recommended this hair dryer. Obviously, he uses his multiple times each day and his lasts for years. It really did cut down my drying time. Only negative is the weight. I don't mind it as I'm using it - it's an other arm workout :) it's when I travel with it that makes me wish it was lighter. I'm always to the weight limit on my checked bags so this goes into my carry on and it's another workout! Still love it and would recommend it."
"I found it ideal as a travel hair dryer. It's small size fits into my shaving kit, but it also surprised me just how powerful it is, to dry and style wet hair."
I have thick curly hair that I straighten twice a week. This hair dryer makes it easy! I highly recommend it!
"The quality of ionized hair-drying you get with this dryer is no less than top of the line salon dryers like CHI. The build quality of this dryer is better than my CHI that died on me. When I opened the CHI to attempt to repair it, I couldn't believe how cheaply made it was and I was amazed at what the retail markup must be. It's like jewelry, they must be making a fortune...The only reason to buy a CHI over this dryer is if you are a stylist and you have an image to uphold, i.e. pretentious clientele that would look down on you for using a Remington."
"I have short hair, so use this as my daily hair dryer. Very compact, strong heat and airflow.  Warning: it's a bit loud."
"love this dryer,, it is my second one, but wish it lasted longer- first one was less than 2 yrs"
Easy to tote around.  Small and light enough to keep in my gym bag.
I only wish that I had bought this blow dryer when ever they first came out...my hair drys in more than half of the time faster....excellent product...
"It's extremely hot, so it just takes 15-20 minutes for me blow dry my wet hair as if I have ironed it :)"
"I have always had difficulty using the round brush and a normal hair dryer to straighten my hair.  My arms would get so tired.  With the Andis 82105 Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer, I am able to make my spiral curl hair straight in 1/2 the time that it used to.  I have been getting so many compliments on my hair since I bought it!"
"A few years ago, I used a First Class hair dryer that was provided in the Marriott Hotel and loved it. When I got home, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I love this hair dryer! I use it all the time - not just when traveling. It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also. We both prefer this hairdryer to many other more expensive ones we've tried through the years. I highly recommend this hairdryer!"
It's been more than a year since I made this purchase (dropped it a few times) and the dryer works like new.
"I looked for months to find a hair dryer that had 3 heat settings (low, med, high) AND 3 actual fan speeds (low, med, high). It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.<br /><br />Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I'm trying to cover all the topics.<br /><br />Fan Speeds:<br />High: It's a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I'd compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.<br />Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.<br />Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.<br /><br />Heat Settings:<br />High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.<br />Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.<br />Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.<br /><br />Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I'd like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.<br /><br />Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I'd rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don't move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don't find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.<br /><br />Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you're using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.<br /><br />As a whole:<br />This dryer is a fantastic buy! I'm going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn't get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won't blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon's site; it's nice, but I really didn't buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident.

"Long and heavy duty cord, powerful, great attachments, enough settings and the buttons are a little recessed so you can't mistakenly hit them while you're drying.  Fees sturdy but not too heavy.  Good product for the buck."
"This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time. It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum). It is a perfect size for any bathroom (we bought a white one for one bathroom and this black for another). The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang. That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer."
"So this blow dryer has a purple hint of color just an fyi and love it. I used it for the first time because my other blow dryer would cause a lot of split ends, instantly. So I used it for the first time and no split ends, yay!. I also did use another blow out product with this blow dryer which you should try to prevent split ends. I use the RedKen Satinwear Blow dry Lotion before I start blow drying and both combined work wonders. Your hair will look like you just came out of the salon."
"This was purchased to replace the one that got stomped (by accident). It is of a very professional quality, without the high price tag."
"Easy to use, it has two different attachments and several speeds to choose from. It works well for home use."
"I needed a basic, reliable hair dryer.  That is what I got, and I did not over-pay for it.<br /><br />The option for air-only is convenient - in a pinch I was able to dry out a nearly-ruined paycheck without damaging it."
"I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Chi dryer, one almost twice as expensive as this one, that was none-too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year.  I was somewhat skeptical of spending even $80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful.  However, this dryer does not disappoint!  It's reasonably light weight, powerful and easy to grip for self-done blow-outs.  I will say, it's not particularly quiet, but I am a consumer level user so I could really care less how much noise it makes.  All in all, it's a solid purchase, highly recommended!"
"I love this dryer!!!!  It is quieter than other dryers that I have owned and dries my hair in half the time.  It is a little heavier, but it is very well balanced so I don't notice anymore."
This is my third Andis Hangup Pro Turbo Hair Dryer of this model over the past 15 years or so. My husband and I use it on a daily basis and love the convenience of having it on the wall for easy access. Product is very reliable. Must keep dust screen in back of handheld unit clean. It is very easy to clean as it unscrews. Wall mount has a reset button if unit shuts down due to overheating which doesn't usually occur if screen is kept clean. Would purchase another of this product when needed.
"Very high powered drying with 3 heat settings, and 3 power settings.  Really like the way it streamlines the air.  Have not tried the diffuser yet but I am sure it works well.  Got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg.  Only one coil was working.  Dries my hair in about a third of the time.  Would recommend to a friend."
"I saw other reviews talk about it being super powerful.  I don't find that, but it's quite adequate.  It IS heavy and big, but I'm ok with it, and I'm tiny.  I don't see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling, which this does.  I love the low noise level, as it is right by my ear, I've had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past.  The only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle.  I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it's easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I'm a tiny person.  Sometimes I grasp the blower part like pros do in salons, thank goodness for its low vibration.  Just that the beautiful silk finish gets oily from my hand that way.  Oh well, still a great dryer overall.  I've had it a year already."
"I've only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days, but I already love it. The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn't burn my scalp.etter than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update.

"A little noisy, but powerful, small enough to pack. Cord is a bit on the short side, but it's perfect for my use."
"I bought Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer almost a years ago (02 August 2014), and it is a great hair dryer - definitely a 5 stars.<br /><br />Both I and my husband (and occasionally our dog) have been using this hair dryer on a daily basis - we're among those people who always dry their hair - and it still works perfectly.<br />I am quite picky when it comes to hair dryer: I like them to be powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, but I also want them to be gentle not to kill my hair. The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.<br /><br />I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!"
"I was really affraid to purchase this product on line, since its just coming out as one of Pibbs newest editions. I must admit,this blow dyer is hands down top of the line,I work mainly with blowouts on natural hair clients,Im saying this blow dryer can straighten out the thickest kinky tightly coiled hair hands down, during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable, oh and not to mention the drying time, I'm throwing the in towel on that one,just made my job easier, super light weight, not heavy like the other dryers use to be, my dryer for ever,love,love,love my new pibbs,faster drying time+more clients= fast money;)"
This dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one but this one is lighter and easier to style your hair with.  Itdries your hair quickly too.  I don't need it on the highest setting for too long.  It came with a concentrator and a diffuser.
"I have straight thick hair and my old hair dryers would leave it frizzy until I slept on it. However when I tried it with this blowdryer, even at the fast dry attachment, it was smooth and sleek.<br /><br />Now that I have a digital perm, I can use the diffuser. I put half of my hair twisted, sectioned into thirds and put it on the diffuser! It works wonderful so far. I'm so happy with this blow dryer. Worth the price. First expensive blow dryer I have owned. Now I can have nice waves."
"I installed this little hair dryer because I was tired of the hair dryer and cord laying on my sink and counter -- it always seemed to be in the way.  My concerns that this hair dryer was not powerful enough turned out to be for naught.  Excellent hair dryer, plenty of power and a lower setting for those who like to take twice as long with their hair (like my GF).  Easy to mount -- love the hook to hang the cord on."
The only negative reviews I read about this (and all other dryers) is that some die too early. Hopefully this one will not suffer from early death syndrome. It is ideal for bathrooms with limited counter space. We are extremely please with the design and the white night light is a nice feature and not too bright as was mentioned in reviews of alternative models. Chose this one after analyzing reviews of all models. It is a little more expensive but well worth it.
"I like the color, the attachments, and the retractable cord. I didn't feel like the hair dryer was too heavy or too loud. If you blow dry your hair on high then yes it is loud but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet. I'd buy this again, I think it was a great value for the price."
This was delivered well within the promised window even though we were in the middle of one of the worst weather weeks this winter so far.  When I used the dryer I was even more pleased because my hair felt sooooo soft and was so shiny. Even my hubby thought my hair felt softer.  You ladies are doing great work and I thank Amazon for carrying your line of products.
"As a scent-o-phile, this was a classic that just HAD to be tested for my collection. Visit basenotes-dot-net to read about the legacy of this fragrance. If you like Creed's version of Original Vetiver, but find it a bit too clean and light for a vetiver, you REALLY must try Guerlain's formulation. This set is not the newest recipe, but the previous one from the 90s. Apparently the newer version is a bit brighter, but not nearly as rich.<br /><br />This starts clean with a hint of lemon and grass clippings, but quickly dries down to an earthy and slightly mineralic cedar. Final dry down is to a rich and exceptionally warm woody oak-moss with a powdery overlay. Soapy-clean permeates throughout the entire range of the scent.  This is mature, masculine and a barbershop-clean classic. Makes Creed's version seem flat and incredibly overpriced.<br /><br />The EDT miniature is splash only (no spray). The aftershave lotion smells even warmer than the EDT, due to high oil content and no alcohol. The bath gel/shampoo is a bit chemical smelling at first, but complements the cologne well enough."
"I'm so excited to write my review for this one. I was doing research about the best hairdryers, because there are millions of them out there.<br />This one is perfect.  I have waist length, thick, wiry and wavy red hair that really enjoys frizzing and making my life unpleasant.  Finding hair products that work for me, is like my life's mission.  This does get hot! I'm not sure what might be wrong with the other reviewer's products, I think mine gets plenty hot.  Hot enough to dry it fast, without burning the mickey out of my scalp, and man does this thing have POWER.<br />And  its quiet for how much fast air it can blow!<br /><br />I love this, it works great on my hair for volume, or diffusing, and even straightening.  Cuts my hair prep time in half.  Recommend!"
I ordered this off Amazon as it was half the price of Target.  I was worried that it wouldn't be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back) thick hair.  It works just like a bigger dryer and is the size of my hand.  I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  Got this dryer and Remington Travel curlers...its all good.  Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.
"I've NEVER styled my hair with a blow dryer. I always just dry & then flat iron, for many reasons. Mainly I'm not coordinated enough to use a round brush & hold a blow dryer. In my 20s I bought the round brush blow dryer. You know the all in one, lol & it worked okay but my hair was still frizzy. This blow dryer is AMAZING! Even with me fighting the round brush in one hand & the dryer in the other, my hair is smooth & shiny. Just like when I leave the salon! Don't pass on this one ladies, worth every penny! I did notice a weird smell, I'm hoping it was just the dryer components heating up for the first time."
I've using this dryer for 2 months and decided to get one for my sis and my mom too. It's different than the regular dryer cuz it comes w/ multi-functions. You can choose &#34;scalp mode&#34; for sensitive scalp and &#34;skin mode&#34; when applying face mask. Its a bit pricey but the money is all worth it!!
"This has the performance I was looking for.  I have fine, straight hair that I blowdry almost daily and this has the power to not only cut down my drying time but also makes it so I dont have to use the flat iron as much because it powers out the waves I do have.<br />I do sometimes hit the cool button by accident while drying because of where its located on the handle but I can live with that.<br />My sister had this dryer before me and I had to copy her.  The only con I would say is it doesnt get super hot but my daughter loves that about it when I blowdry her hair."
This is my second--I blew up the first forgetting to convert from US to European currency (it was quite dramatic).  But I rushed to Amazon on my return and bought another one--it really is the best US or intercontinental hair dryer I've ever traveled with.  It gets very hot on high--which is just fine with me.  And it's a noisy sucker.<br /><br />But it weighs very little and is a real trooper--I think I had the first one over five years (and its ultimate failure was mine not the manufacturer's).<br /><br />Read the reviews--most people really really like it.
Love it!  Very gentle on your hair.  No more heat damaged hair. In 5 to 10 minutes your hair is dry with curlers or without.
This is the second of this product that I have owned.  The first lasted over six years but unfortunately quit working so I ordered another just like it.  Works great.  I don't have to go hunting for the hair dryer and plugging it in and putting it away every day.  I highly recommend it.
I like that this hair drier is quiet. It has multiple heat settiing with a good high heat setting.  It is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some. Although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability.  I have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality. This is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical Conair brands.I have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day I purchased  If looking for quite and quality I would recommend Remington.  Well worth it.
This hair dryer is the best anywhere. This is my second purchase due to one of my granddaughters breaking the previous one. Will order again in the future if need be.
I have a bad shoulder and this is great for traveling. It holds to the mirror really well with a small travel size dryer. Not sure if it could hold a bigger dryer. excellent product. Quick delivery
Both my daughter and myself were looking for a dryer that didn't go in the drawer.  I read all the reviews and choose this one.<br /><br />I really like the simplicity of the dryer.  It dries my hair with ease and I have thick and long hair.<br /><br />The only drawback to this dryer is the length of the cord.  Make sure you can place close to the edge of your counter top.
"Dryer works as intended and is more useful than a salon style dryer in that it's portable.  I also think using a bonnet as opposed to salon style dryer is more efficient in drying the hair due to creating a closed hair-drying environment.  However, that's just my opinion; I don't have anything to prove that.  The only negative that I have relative to bonnet style dryer is -- from experience -- the bonnet wears/tears up before the dryer breaks and I haven't been able to get replacement bonnets."
Great hairdryer. Works perfectly fine. It dries my hair in less than 5 minutes! My hais short but a bit thick.
Got this to use on my dog who needed to be bathed almost every day.  Gets the job done quickly which is what I wanted.  Have owned it for five months and hope that it has a long life.
"I cannot believe I spent this much on a hairdryer, but I do really like it much better than the one I got at the large chain store. Wish it cost less, but would probably buy it again... ( :"
"The matte finish was the first thing we noticed when we opened the hair dryer.  It is great - looks good and has a great - soft texture.  The temperature settings are low, med and high and it has a cool button for when you need a blast of cold air.  The fan can be set to low and high.  The fan moves lots of air.<br /><br />Even an 80's era, big hair band could save time with this product.  That kind of hair needs to be washed, rinsed, washed again and then heavily conditioned.  The conditioner softens the hair and forces it to accept massive amounts of water.  This increased water volume must be removed prior to styling or the hair will just sit there flat - like a poorly tuned guitar.  Pull the Conair 225NP from the holster, point it at the hair and get started.  The powerful DC fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out.  The three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process.  The entire band can share one 225NP and still be on the stage in time to rock the house!<br /><br />Medium heat and high speed fan gets hair dry fast with no friz."
Drys hair quick! A little bulky but worth it.  The other reviews were worth reading for this item. Thank you
I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  Sadly it passed away.  I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &#34;if only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  I wasn't eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn't match the wall color.<br />Yippee!  I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.<br />The new dryer is perfect!
"This hair dryer is extremely affordable, especially when compared to other brand hair dryers of equal ability.  This dryer is easy to use and is great for any female in your life."
"The hotels I normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer.  After a few tries and loved the power and level of dry time, I just had to order it.  I got the regular and travel size.  Love them both."
"I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time."
"I've had this hair dryer for almost 4 years now, and to this day I love it. I have dry, frizzy, Hermione Granger-esqe hair so I needed something that wouldn't feel like I'm frying it. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone. It comes with a diffuser which I only used like once or twice but it's ok. I'm gonna have this one for awhile, I love the sleek design too, I don't see it becoming outdated like those pink and green hair dryers from the 70s or something. Thanks scientists at Conair, I salute you."
"This is probably the best hair dryer I've ever had.  I have really thick, corse hair and haven't generally dried it much in the past because it would take so long.  Then once it was dry I'd have to straighten it because it would be all frizzy.  Not anymore!!!  This thing dries my hair quickly and also leaves it very smooth.  I LOVE it!  Now I dry my hair almost daily since it doesn't take me an hour from start to finish!"
Works very well.  I have the same blow dryer in the past and that lasted a long time it's a really great blow dryer
"This is a great hair dryer for traving. it fold up small and the cord retracts into the dryer at the push of a button. It drys my long, thick hair in record time. I couldn't ask for a better product."
"Great hair dryer. I have coarse, thick hair that retains water really well. This dryer has enough umph to do the job."
"...worth five stars just for that. Quiet, powerful with several settings and a comfortable ergonomic handle. Convenient hook keeps the blow dryer out of our way next to the vanity when not in use."
Looked for a long time for a hair dryer that has a low medium and high heat setting and a low medium and high blower button. This is a great hair dryer dried my hair fast!
Love this! It's stronger than most blow dryers I've used in the past 3 years. The look is very professional and the color is a deep purple with soft pink. I should have purchased the hair wand that went with it. Matchy Matchy!
I got this dryer to replace my old one and wow does it make a difference.  My hair is so soft and shiny. I can even use this to dry my 1 year old daughter's hair and I couldn't to that with my old one because it would get too hot even on the lower setting. It dries fast without burning.  Definitely worth every cent!
I love this blow dryer! I was tired of taking 5 minutes to blow dry my thick hair so I went on a search for something that would be faster. So many say they blow dry faster but this one really does. So glad I purchased this. I no longer dread blow drying!
Shipped quickly and works wonderfully. Nice hot dryer to get the job done in no time. You will not be sorry!
"I've used it at least 5 times in the 3 weeks since I bought it! Arrived via FedEx two days after I ordered it, very easy to assemble and operate. Highly recommended styling tool, particularly for natural hair wearers, or at home hair style mavens. My friend in the military posted overseas swears by hers! Offers high heat or cool temperatures, and has a built in timer. Easy to move around as needed. Would totally buy again!"
"i absolutely love this hair dryer! i cant believe i waited so long to buy one. great for roller sets ( my 2 1/2&#34; rollers are almost too big- they barely fit , i think a 2&#34; roller would be more comfortable) and deep conditioning treatment, i do one almost everytime i shampoo now its that easy. it is large and raising and lowering the bonnet is not easy but it only takes about 15 minutes for my hair to dry with a roller set at the setting on 60, you cant beat that! no more tugging and pulling on my fragile bleached hair to blow dry it ( which takes me about a half a hour) i just sit and relax for 15 minutes and then touch the set up with a flat iron. i would buy this over again in a heart beat!"
Got dryer pretty quick.  my daughter loves it and she has thick long hair.  Satisfied so far with this product
"Not only am I happy with this hairdryer, but I've already had a houseguest that is coveting it after using it. It has great power, is small enough to consider taking it when I travel, and was really reasonably priced. I hate to admit it, but it's better than the $150 Italian hairdryer that I was replacing."
Wonderful hair dryer.  I bought this one for my camper and after using it I put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house. It dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy.  I was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it I will not use anything else.  I love it!
"I have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one. I'm so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I'm not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn't convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &#34;white girl afro&#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!<br />After reading some reviews and Q&As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!<br />My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn't be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.<br />I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it."
"For the price, this is a pretty nice dryer. I almost never use the low setting on hair dryers regardless, but I tested it just to see, and it's not quite hot enough to give me the oomph I need to dry my hair. So there's that. The cold shot seems to suck up a lot of power, and I don't use it any more for fear of blowing a circuit breaker, but considering how much I paid for it, this does its job and it does it pretty well."
"As a cosmetologist, we all need a professional blower, shipped a lot sooner than what I expected and worked perfectly fine. Brand new product."
I have fine & thick hair and this product has cut down 50% of drying time.  It is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare.
When I decided to purchase this..my mind was made up..I was going professional.  The price for a professional hair dryer could be very expensive considering I am not a hairstylist; so I brought this..it was priced in the middle.  I totally love this Elchim!!! I have curly hair and I could straighten it or wear it curly with no frizz.  I would recommend this product.  It's worth every penny.
Got this for my gf for Christmas and she couldn't be happier.  She likes how quiet it is and the extra piece on the end of it.  Not sure what that's called or what it's used for but all that matters is that she's happy.
Other reviews indicate the advertising was in error as the unit did NOT include acool slection.  The one we received DID have this. The unit is extremely light and gets the job done.
"i am a hairdresser for 20 years, i've had tried so many different blow-dryers but this works wonders on every hair types,no other blow-dryer make the hair silky and shiny like silver bird,but it will not last long ,like in two months it will brake, every two or three months i buy new one as i did not find a better blow-dryer i will keep buying it.."
"New favorite dryer for professional use. I am a stylist and having the right dryer makes all the difference. This things blows hard and gets hot. I use it on medium heat and low speed and still cut my drying time in half with gorgeous results. Very little need for curling iron or flat irons when done. Time saver, light weight and I even like the diffuser:"
"I have long fine hair. I very rarely use a hairdryer, but when camping, traveling etc there is a need. Having dual voltage is a plus. This one is simple, reliable, dries my hair nicely on low, and in short does what it should do. Really like the supplied cone for directed drying."
"I bought this for my wife with her long,thick hair because she always complained about how her rotary style hair dryer wasn't powerful enough. I was at my barbershop and noticed this was the model my barber used and it blew strong hot air so I decided to get her one and she loves it."
"I used this dryer in Italy. They have a higher current, so I'm glad I read the directions. I set the dial to the correct current, and only used low setting. It was quite powerful, and dried my hair in an equal amount of time as my full sized dryer at home.<br />Also, it comes with a little diffuser that works well. How cute!"
Live this hairdryer
I did my research before buying a new hairdryer and this one fits the bill without having to spend $1-200.  It works well
"I defrost my freezer with it, I thawed out my car doors with itr.  I live in a humid part of the country where a towel doesn't quite get the job done so I use it for that.  I even dey my hair with it"
"A MUST HAVE FOR FREEZY/CURLY /UNRULY HAIR ,MAKES BLOW DRYING A BREEZE,I PURCHASED ONE ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO...STILL GOING STRONG!I USE IT EVERY DAY,ALSO FOR TOUCH UPS, SO I'VE DECIDED TO GET A NEW ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER THAT WILL GRADUATE COLLEGE(JUST IN CASE SHE DECIDES TO MOVE OUT...:)),FAIRLY LIGHT,RIGHT PRICE,AND COMBINED WITH AMAZON SERVICE AND RELIABILITY.........PRICELESS ,GO FOR IT ,YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
I've been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months and I love it. It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East. I also like that the dryer came with the two attachments. The handle also folds in to save space on packing.  One thing I would point out to people looking at the reviews is that you will need a screw driver to change the voltage of the hair dryer. Just something to keep in mind depending on your use of the hair dryer. But I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone needing a dual voltage or travel hair dryer.
"Purchased for domestic travel. Solid construction, compact, and the high heat speed has a powerful air flow for such a small head size. Drys hair fast. Has low heat speed if you need it. Very satisfied with purchase!"
"My Elchim from the 90s finally died and it was like a death in the family.  My hair, while I used a temporary hair dryer was atrocious with frizz and stray hairs everywhere.  This Elchim showed up and it was like a miracle.  The hair dryer is just amazing.  I read some of the reviews and there was a burning smell for the 1st and maybe 2nd time I used it, but never again.  It leaves your hair silky smooth!<br />Oh and regarding the heaviness...don't judge a book by its cover.  It is heavy until you use it.  Then magically the weight is distributed nicely.  Don't ask me how...some kudos go to the designers!"
"Works great, not heavy on the hands to use and it doesn't fry my hair . I have baby thin fly away wavy hair and this blower keeps it in control with minimal heat . Definitely recommend! As usual Amazon delivers on time or before time."
"Very nice little hair dryer for the money. Good reviews are what sold me, and I wasn't disappointed."
"Today,( 3/14/14) that I used my hair dyer, I have to say I just love it. My hair is naturally curly but takes so, long too dry. I have a hand held dyer with the diffueser attchatment an it makes my hair puffy.  I started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick an sufficient an when looking they were really expensive as well as shipping and handling but when I compared on amazon your company caught my eye because on the head of the dyer was elongated and there was zero shipping so, all I paid was 104.00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling. I also colored my hair an I use a heating cap an it does not color my head completely so, this will make for a better job on my color. Thank you so so so so so much......"
"I had to have a hair dryer so I could dry my Silky Terrier's long fine hair after her bath. I needed a dryer that was lightweight because several years ago I hurt my hand and it's hard for me to hold a heavy hair dryer for very long. This is perfect. It's very lightweight, small and easy for me to hold. I love this hair dryer and don't mind using it, as it doesn't hurt my hand at all."
I've been a stylist for 15 yrs and I can tell you nothing compares to this dryer in terms of closing the cuticle with added shine however I do recommend getting the Twin Turbo/ionic for $30 more it's worth every penny. I couldn't be more happier and it's made in Italy so the finest materials go into construction and you can feel it. The weight and the little kickback when turned on sounds crazy but this this is powerful.
"Pleased with new blow dryer.  Dries hair, just as advertised.  Love the retractable cord.  Keeps my gym bag a little less messy.  Love the red."
"I've ordered lots of things on Amazon before, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review. I just love this hair dryer! I bought it because I was tired of all the different cords on our bathroom counter- hair dryer, straightener, curler, husband's shaver charger, etc. So the retractable feature was what drew me to this product. But after using it, I've found a bunch of added bonus, one of which is how fast it dries my hair. It literally takes only half the time than my previous drier. It's also pretty quiet, and the ceramic coil doesn't produce the burning smell like older hair driers do. Overall I'd say this is the one product that really impressed me. [...]"
"Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful.  I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn't have fingers; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers) I've used.  It left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers.  The only drawback I can see is it's quite large so when traveling I will have to resort to my old fold-up one."
"Perhaps it's strange coming from me, but I've purchased 2 of these and it's still my favorite blow dryer!<br />I used this dryer for more than 4 years and never had a problem.<br />I purchased a second one because I gave the first one to my fiance', who lives in Japan!<br />Her mom fell in love with it, didn't bring it to the States so I had to buy yet another ConAir blow dryer :).<br />But now she has my second one, and won't accept the ConAir Infiniti Pro I bought for her.<br />Too bad, because I miss my cordless action :(<br />But I can still blow dry my hair after taking the braids out, because this is by far the best dryer ever."
after too many drops it finally stop working. I am surprised it took so long! def. buying another one
"I'm no hairdresser but to me these clippers feel like a professional set. They're heavy and sturdy and powerful! They have a thick, no-nonsense cord. Just sturdy! Oh, and they cut hair really well too, no more catching. I'd recommend these for sure!"
"I have used this product for several years on trips outside the US - mostly in Europe and Israel. This is a very fine product with three important factors:<br /><br /> -- 1600 Watt. At this lower wattage, I have never had a problem with foreign electrical power in any room I have rented.<br /><br />_-- Dual Voltage. Since its a travel hair dryer - I would suggest you keep voltage at 220. I kept switching it every time I came back to US and apparently the switch broke. See Customer Service below.<br /><br /> -- Customer Service. After 2 years of use, they said no problem and replaced the hair dryer immediately.<br /><br />I wish every company was as consumer friendly as Andis and stood behind their products as they do."
We have one already just like it and the wife loves it and that is why we bought another one.A Bargain.Our old one is 6 years old and we are ready for the new one.
"Tiny and light, just right for carryon air travel. This is my second one; first one lasted for several years with DAILY use. Can't live without it."
After 8 years with my old hair dryer. It was time for a new one.<br />This dryer had more option than my old one.<br />And it cut my drying time in half.
"I am so glad my other dryer bit the dust! This Dryer is the nicest one I have ever owned, It dries my hair quickly without blowing like a tornado and my hair is a whole lot less frizzy!"
I love this hairdryer. It has a lot of power and I like that it has three heat settings as well as two fan settings .  It is not too loud and not too heavy.
Use it as a cheap heat gun for installing skins and such on tablets and phones.  Works well enough.
I would definitely recommend I am African American and my hair is natural. This blow dryer gets my hair straight without the extra hassle plus the comb attachment makes it super easy.
"Does not dry out my thick, coarse hair. Hair is softer, more manageable, and more conditioned compared to a standard hair dryer. Highly recommended!"
"I love, love, love this hairdryer!! It dries my in half the time my old one did. And it doesn't get hot to the touch like my old hairdryer did. My only complaint is that it's heavier than I expected but not so heavy that it's unmaneuverable."
"I have very thick, frizzy, and what you could call &#34;confused&#34; hair (not wavy or curly or straight). I have straightened my hair with a blow dryer since I was 13 years old. Needless to say, I have been through A LOT of blow dryers. This is the best one I have ever had. I'm on my second and about to buy my third (for backup). It does get pretty hot, but I alternate with the low and high setting depending on which part of my hair I'm doing and how much is in the piece. I HIGHLY recommend this blow dryer if you have thick, unruly hair as myself, it's a BEAST. What used to take me hours now takes me 30-40 minutes tops. Very happy."
"With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use. <br /> <br />The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9) aren't long enough to make its use practicable. <br /> <br />Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer."
"I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  The only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler.  Other than that side note, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair)."
This is an excellent hair dryer and really feels like it will last a long time.  Very high quality and well worth the money.  Only gripe is the toggle switches are a tiny bit too short/small for me to hit with one handed operation but thats just me. This is a must buy if you are in the market for a decent hair dryer that isn't too expensive. MM
"I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.  I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!"
"I have used this dryer several times.  I like the settings and also the fact that it isn't too heavy for it's size.  Also, the price was right and it had other good reviews."
"I never actually thought that a hairdryer could be different from any other hair dryers. Unbeknownst to me, I was sorely mistaken. This keeps the static out! And I admit that I have quite a mane of hair, and this drys it in record speeds. A lot of customization with temp/speed/air flow. Highly recommended."
"My husband put it together and got to use it twice. So far so good, but you do need to be careful so it won' tip over. It is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad. If I did not hear the ticking I would not know if it was on or not. I can have a conversation with the person sitting under it that's how quiet it is and it gets really hot. My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable. For the amount of money I think it is worth it."
"I researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one. My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. Remington also has a 4 year warranty, which is very comforting."
"I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I'm coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later. I've burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past. I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.<br /><br />The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I've stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!<br /><br />While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It's not hard to turn back on, so I don't see it as that big of an issue.<br /><br />I've had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments. I called their customer service number and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I'd had the dryer for more than a year!"
Had a hard hood dryer for over 10 year. Yes it worked great..donated it to my neighbor.. this software bonnet puts the heat in all the right areas of your head. Light weight. go too the Landry room and fold clothes while on my head.<br />Lol..Yes I do plug it in there
Exactly what I was looking for! Here's hoping it lives a long and service-oriented life.
Great hair dryer. It's kinda heavy it really dries my thick hair fast.  The cold shot is nice and cool.
"I have never paid so much for a blow dryer, but I have NO regrets.  I feel as if it is so worth it and I get a quick and professional blow out.  I expect this to last a very long time, but I would buy another in a heartbeat."
"After buying cheap, but high watt  dryers for years, I am a convert. This has cut my drying time in half."
I really like this hairdryer!  I bought it to replace my Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light.  That dryer broke after a year of use and had a disgusting bright green nightlight.  This Sunbeam is wonderful!  It is very powerful and super compact on my wall.  The only complaint I have is that the on/off button are not on the handle but on the hanger.  I prefer it to be on the handle but that is just a personal preference.
"good travel dryer. small, light and worked well for our three week trip to Italy. only needed the outlet adapter. did not need a heavy converter. still using for travel."
"Love this powerful dryer.  It's pretty heavy duty, and it's a little heavier in weight than any other dryer I've had.  But it has the cool setting medium heat and High fast dry mode.  Pretty loud, but what hair dryer isn't it?  It smoothes the hair too , removing the frizz.  Combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results!"
"LOVED this hair dryer! Didn't even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn't resist. I figured my old one would break eventually. I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it. WOW! I couldn't believe how soft my hair was! My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz. I usually had to tame with Biosilk Silk Therapy after drying. But with this dryer, I don't need to use anything! My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty. It dries faster than my old one and it's quieter (big plus since my baby's bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)"
"Was looking for something exactly like this! I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair. creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this. I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one! Just the right strength. It does get hot so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you'll be just fine. highly recommend!"
"This dryer dries my long hair quickly and efficiently.  I even notice less frizz than I used to, which is fantastic."
I have used Quantum for over 20 years - through all it's changes.  I have tried numerous other kind but always return to Quantum because it is the only one that  can handle my difficult hair. It is a great product.
"I'm not one to buy expensive haircare products but after a stay at a hotel, I fell in love with the blow dryer in the rooms.  I wrote down the brand and model and set out to find one when I got home.  Amazon was the only place that was still selling this model.  I almost bought 2 in case they go out of production but I guess I'll just use this one and hope it lasts forever, lol."
"I had this exact same hair dryer - purchased at a retail store - for years.  When looking for a new one, I bought this one again on Amazon."
"I've had a few different hair dryers and by far this is my favorite. Fast, powerful, and lite. Definitely recommend it."
"My wife swears by this hair dryer and she is on her third unit. That may sound bad, but each one has lasted 5 years, so definitely seems okay for the price.<br />Lightweight, nice rubber grip, and not too loud."
"This dryer exceeds expectations.  Dries hair fast, is quiet and light weight (big plus) and no frizzies!  In fact, sometimes it makes my hair too silky so I have to use more harsh shampoo or only a teenie weenie bit of conditioner."
I bought this dryer after using my mom's similar dryer and reading the reviews for this one. I totally love it. I have very thick long hair and it took close to an hour to fully blow dry my hair with my old conair dryer. This one dried my hair in literally about 5 minutes. It is also very light. I wish it was a tax quieter but overall I am more than pleased with my purchase.
This hair dryer works really fast on Turbo and my hair feels very soft when it's dry.  I really like it!
"So far, I like this hair dryer.  It is very strong and has really helped cut down on my dry time."
"I LOVE this drier as it is compact, folds, takes little space in the suitcase and works well. I don't use it often as it stays in my suitcase and is ready for the next trip."
"my other ionic hair dryer just quite, so took a chance on this brand and not sorry what so ever!! fairly quiet and love the optional speeds and temp's that my other one didn't have."
"For me, this dryer has been fantastic! I have had it for 3 months and use it 3 or 4 times a week; and, I have no problems with it at all. It is compact, which means it takes up very little space. I would recommend it, based on my experience."
I bought this hair dryer to replace my previous Hot Tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use. This hair dryer is even better than my old one! It is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one. I take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily.
"Absolutely love this hairdryer. It has a special grip coating that keeps it from slipping around, and is powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly without frizzing"
This little hair dryer is fantastic for the price!  It's speedy and I love the fact it hangs up.  The black is priced much less than the white.  Super Bargain!
"I bought this for my wife - in fact she didn't even know I got it for her until it arrived. The (now previous) unit she had was making me deaf - from halfway across the house!!  This is much, much quieter, and the frequencies it produces are not ear shattering. She hasn't complained, so maybe she was thinking the same or perhaps she just likes how it does her hair - she looks good to me!!."
"Product was shipped promptly, is exactly as advertised. Not too much, not too little.....does the job to dry both my hair and my Chihuahua's after a bath."
The reason I bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle. The fact that it's a great dryer and ionic was a plus. My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer. You have to pull it out and try again. If you're not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently. This happened to me . I tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because I couldn't get it back together. I bought another one and now I am more careful.
"We actually bought this for drying the dog after his baths. He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.<br />If you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician."
"OMG, I have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years!  After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.  I highly recommend this dryer, and you can't beat the price!"
Hard to believe a hair dryer can make such a difference!  This one does.  Hair feels amazing and it's incredibly fast.  Can't beat the price either.
"If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price it's a great deal.  It is not the identical model to the current one, as it only has 1600 watts vs. 2000 watts for the current one.  But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an authorized dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  I'd rather pay $100 with no warranty than $300 with one (that's like spending $200 on an extended warranty)."
"We wanted something that our children could use since we have very limited counter space in the bathroom.  So far, it's been just what we needed.  And, it is much more quiet than hotel wall mounts we have used."
"Perfect for vanity top storage! I hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my BR countertop. Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder. So, I got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at Bed, Bath, & Beyond. Problem solved! The solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer, it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup, AND eliminated the counter-top clutter of a power cord."
"I love this hairdryer because it's small, and lightweight, yet quite powerful, both in heat and flow.  The switch is very easy to use, and I prefer a small white hairdryer to be accidentally seen on the bathroom counter, instead of a huge heavy clunky black and chrome model that doesn't fit in a drawer when I need to tidy up.  This one is also small enough for travel."
Strong blow dryer. Had the exact same one and after 7 years it started to spark inside so I decided it was time for another one.  I use it several times a week and am hoping this one lasts just as long.
"It looks like it would be too small to be effective, but not so. This little gadget really blows, and in a good way. The dual-voltage aspect makes it good for international travel. Get one. You won't be disappointed."
"Used this product at a Courtyard Marriott and was surprised to find it better than my home hair dryer.  I have thick hair. It usually took me a long time to dry my hair with my old dryer which was heavy, plus the cord got tangled, and the high heat, which I need, often got too hot.  This Ion hair dryer had NONE of those issues; so when I returned home I looked it up on the internet and was delighted to find it reasonably priced and bought it.  I've been using it for 2 months now and love it."
The temperature and speed is just right.  It doesn't dry out my hair.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer
"I had a little difficulty finding a surface to put it on that would match up with a seat that I had to be high enough up into the hood.  If you're short like me (5'2&#34;), you can't just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs.  It would be helpful if the advertizing text stated how high the top of the inside of the hood was from the surface on which the dryer rested."
"Curly hair here. I think it does dry faster, but my old machine was pretty worn out.<br /><br />I love that there is an actual setting for cool air plus the button for a shot of it.<br /><br />My finger always ached after using my last one, which only had that blue button and not the addt'l setting."
"I had been looking for an affordable but fast drying dryer. This one is amazing. It gets my hair dry a lot quicker, does not overheat, and has great adjustable speeds and heating. However, I will say that the only con to this product is that it is not completely comfortable to hold. I will occasionally hit the cold button on the hair dyer because I don't know where else to comfortably hold it."
Very light-weight.  Dries my shoulder length THICK hair very fast - almost half the time my old hair dryer.  The red color is cool!  Discovered the Andis brand while staying in a Marriott recently and really liked that one.  This is an upgraded version.  I've read that some people think that it's loud but I don't notice it.  Sounds just like the ones in the salon to me!
"This is a GREAT dryer.  I have very long hair, and it used to take about 20 minutes to get it dry.  This dryer gets me out of the bathroom in about half that time."
"Bought it for my wife because her cheap hairdryer was extremely loud and woke me up.  This one is awesome.  Super quiet and she loves it.  It is quiet enough that we can actually talk while she drys her hair.  That would never have happened with the old dryer.  She says it takes about 5 minutes longer to dry her hair, but that is because she only uses it on medium heat.  High heat is very hot and she is afraid it will hurt her hair."
I love it. No more clutter in the bathroom.
"Purchased several of these a few years ago. Gave one as a gift and my wife kept one. She loved hers, so when she recently gave it to our daughter she bought this one as a replacement. My wife likes the size, power and temperature of this hair dryer and rates it 5 stars."
Works really well! Only thing is control switches are where your fingers go so fingers push switches and changes settings while blow drying.
"It rewinds every time!  Has the usual features, is priced well and except for the purple exotic feature, it blends well in the bathroom."
Works better than any I have used in the past.  Recommended by my beautician.
"Replacing earlier unit, same model. Found only on Amazon:)"
"It's roughly the size of a 5 inch sub from Subway.<br /><br />It dries my hair on two different settings.<br /><br />It feels solid, looks nice with it's black/white colour scheme, and it's now mine.<br /><br />You should buy one too."
"This was an inexpensive hair dryer and I was skeptical about it at first.  It didn't seem to put out as much power as my last dryer which shorted out and blew a house fuse.  However, it seems to dry just as quickly and is not as noisy as my last dryer.  It's easy to handle and not too heavy.  I have been happy with this product."
My only regret is that I didn't find what is essentially the same hair dryer - also available from Amazon - without the wasted (and unneeded) plastic frame (housing... frame?)  above the unit<br /><br />This product attached to the wall with the double faced &#34;sticky things&#34;  included. It hasn't fallen off. It dries my hair. I'm happy.
Had a similar one before and missed it when it finally died. I probably had it ten years or more.
"I have spent lots of money on expensive hair dryers, and this one is by far the best I've ever used."
"I had this same hair dryer for over ten years before it stopped working, so I replaced it with the same model!  I only wish there were more color options, but for the quality the price can't be beat!"
"Bought this for my elderly mother, whose old hairdryer was heavy and bulky. She loves this one, it's light and much easier for a handicapped person to use."
I really enjoy this hair dryer. I needed it to straighten my unruly beard. I don't just it everyday but its loud fast and efficient.
Just what I was looking for! Had one almost identical but fried it in Iceland. Shopped all the locals and could not find this really small size. Bought one with a folding handle thinking that would make it workable but not so. Found this one on Amazon and it is the perfect replacement. Blows like a fool and is small enough to pack.
"THIS IS MY 2ND. ONE, MY FIRST ONE BROKE WHERE THE HAIR DRYER HOOKS INTO THE MOUNT, I WOULD MAKE THAT AREA STRONGER."
We were looking for a replacement for our hair dryer that died. It needed to be powerful for long hair. This one does the job.
"i have owned a few of these before, same style and model. they are very dependable. i love having them mounted on the wall in the bathroom."
This hair dryer seems to work well for all hair types. It blows hot and helps with coarse or unruly hair types.
This is my second of the same model.  Previous one was used every day for over 5 years - exceptional value for money.
"Exactly as described.  Powerful dryer.  Only used it two days so far, but seems to have cut my drying time.  Lighter weight than my old one.  Overall would recommend."
"Bought this as a replacement for an earlier version of the same thing.  The button that you press to start the cord retraction is placed at the widest part of the unit (by necessity) and it got shaved off when closing the vanity drawer so I could no longer retract the cord.  Other than this inherent drawback, I love that the cord retracts for safety/neatness/space-saving, etc.  Dries efficiently without being smoking hot."
"This is my second Andis, it worked so well when it gave out I ordered another one this past February.  Hopefully it'll last as long as the first one.  A great deal for the price."
"This is the second T3 I have purchased, the second was for a gift.  It dries your hair fast.  Saves a lot of time.  Well worth the price"
I was looking for a dryer with no heat option... Those that I have found before have the button that you have to press down in order to get the cool hair...This one is different you can totally dry your hair without using any heat at all because  you can just press cool air button and unless you change it you only use the ambiant air like a very powerful ventilator...
"I love this hair dryer.  It dries my hair fast, and makes my hair very shiny and straight.  I used to use Revlon hair drier from drug store which is about $15.  Revlon hair dryer usually stops working after one year from purchase and makes my hair very dry and unhealthy.  This Panasonic hair dryer is a little pricy compared to regular dryer you can get from drug store but you get what you pay for.  It's worth it.  The finish of the body prevents your fingerprints to stick even though you have hair cream or hand cream on your hand so you can keep the beautiful appearance of the dryer. I feel my hair has been healthier and shinier with this.  I highly recommend this product."
"Decided to buy this hairdryer based on what my hair stylist said. I always wondered why it seems faster to dry my hair at the salon than at home. She said something about ionic hairdryers that not only speed up the drying time, but takes away unwanted frizzy hair. She said to buy a ceramic brush as well to help with drying and to prevent frizzy hair. After purchasing this hairdryer and the right brush, I am able to dry my hair in 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes with a hairdryer bought at like CVS or Rite Aid. I have really thick, medium length hair. Where I live where it gets humid from time to time, my hair does get frizzy. After buying this hairdryer, time and frizz were no longer an issue. My husband even commented on how fast I have been able to dry my hair. I figured if he noticed, then I believe I made the right purchase. This hair dryer is a &#34;game changer&#34;. Definitely, helped me get ready for my day a lot faster."
"After having read the majority of the reviews here, I'm happy to report that this dryer is fast and very lightweight.  My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don't miss having all of the other speeds.  This was well worth the price and I wouldn't ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer.  But the results are well worth it.  Highly recommend!"
"This is the best.  My daughters and I have different types of hair and different lengths. This dryer is so easy to hold, not too heavy or awkward and does an amazing job for each of us with the different settings and attachments  Our only problem was we needed to use it at the same time...so we bought another one!!!"
"I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. I have long and very very thick hair, so I need a powerful dryer (I've tried many of the dryers one could find at the local Rite-Aid or CVS and even after an hour my hair would still not be entirely dry). This one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight. From what I've looked at, this is the strongest travel-size hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip I was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old Solano (which, for the record, I love, but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase). I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space). I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you need something you can travel with. My next purchase will be the 2400W Babyliss, once I can find it in the US."
"My hair is very dense and attracts static VERY quickly.  My usual blowdryer (and all the others I've owned in the past) left my hair dry but pieces of my hair sticking straight up and I'd always have to use a smoother to tame them.  Thankfully I showered at a friend's house one day and borrowed this dryer.  I came out of the bathroom and my friend was like OMG YOUR HAIR LOOKS AMAZING.  No flyaways.  No static.  My hair looked better after JUST DRYING IT than it usually did after I spent 30 minutes styling it.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on Amazon Prime ten minutes later and tossed my old dryer as soon as it came in.  I have since bought two more for my best friends, and they swear by it as well."
I like  the easy access of the dryer hanging on the wall rather than stored in the vanity drawer. It works well plus takes up little space.
"I have full size T3 for the home, and I wanted a compact T3 for travel (because no one wants to have a bad hair-day on vacation; think of the pictures!) I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it."
"oh my I am so pleased. I had my other Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for 22 years. it went through me and 2 daughters and still works. I don't think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less. This blower has large shoes to fill. if it last half as long I will be very pleased."
"I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on a blow dryer and then have it not live up to its claims, but I have to say I am delighted!  My long, curly hair was dry in 7 minutes,  and was soft and not frizzy!!"
"I bought this to replace the exact same model we had for the past 6 years. My wife had dropped our last one for the last time. It didn't stop working, but had so many cracks and was so loose, I was working she would electrocute herself sooner or later.<br /><br />Anyway, we/she liked it so much, we bought the same model."
"I was previously using a compact hair dryer that did more damage to my hair.  With the included nozzles, the adjustable temperature and adjustable air power, my hair is smoother and dries a lot quicker than before.  The cold air button is also a plus if you're round brushing your hair.  The non-slip coating on the dryer makes holding the device very comfortable.  HSI is powerful and works wonderfully.  Love it."
"I have oily skin on to of dry skin, therefore, makes it very hard to find a good skincare line. I get so tired of trying out skincare products made for combination skin (normal/oily). Face creams for dry skin is just too much moisture and oil for my type of skin. Finding good all natural skincare is even harder. I use Pangea Organics line for the day time. I use this oil for night because I wake up with very oily and very dry skin. Using this actually helps reduce this and makes my skin feel so much softer. It's hard for me blend this oil on my face alone without using more than 2 drops. So, I mix this in with my Pangea Organics face lotion at night and wake up with refreshed-looking skin. I haven't tried using this oil in the day time since I get the midday oil slick, but I hear Argan Oil reduces the oiliness without drying the skin. Here's another bonus, my skin tend to get flushed in the afternoon, like as if I just ran a marathon. Using this Argan Oil reduced the redness.     One of the reviewer says it might not be pure because it is fragrance free, instead will try one that has the fragrance. I don't doubt this is product is of lesser quality because the information supplied by Slice of Nature says that there are 3 processing types for Argan oil. One of them is make Argan oil fragrance free and most of the time comes out clear. The other type of processing keeps the fragrance and the color is yellow or darker AND it is mostly used for cooking, maybe for cosmetics. I personally don't want to put cooking oil on my skin, since cooking oil can go rancid very quickly. That's like saying that I will put grapeseed cooking oil for my body. Would you do this? This one from Watt's Beauty is clear and it is contained in a very simple and plain brown bottle with a dropper, which is very useful.     As always with any consumer products, it's always either you like it or you don't. I personally like this and will continue to use it.    I haven't tried using this on my hair or on my body. My hair is pretty normal. I do intend on using this with my body lotion very soon."
Love this hair dryer! 2nd I've owned. First one I got on QVC- Amazon was cheaper to go for this one!  T3 is worth it for hair dryer- I know they r much more expensive- but worth the price. Drying time is less- cuts down on frizz.<br />I'll never go back to store brand!!
"I bought this dryer because it came with a diffuser and I needed a dual voltage dryer for travel to Europe. It folds down and is great for travel. It works well on both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages. The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it. I only plan to use it for travel and only used it for 2 weeks overseas, so I can't vouch for its durability. At this time, though, I am very satisfied with it."
"I have thick, curly hair that I blow out every few days. This blow dryer has cut my drying time in half! The air force is STRONG with this one. Put it down on the bathroom counter and watch your hair ties and whatnot go flying. But it gets the job done, and incredibly well. My hair is *less* dry from this dryer, despite the high heat, and looks very healthy and sleek when blown out.<br /><br />WORTH IT!"
This dryer is lightweight by very powerful.  It dries my hair very fast on a low setting so I have less breakage.
Perfect for long thin hair that doesn't need to be dry in a salon. It won't burn your hair and will leave it with no friz
I wanted a hairdryer that has warm and cool settings and not just hot and hotter.  I bought it to dry my little Japanese Chin after her bath.  She hates to be wet and the Conair dries her in about 10 minutes.
"I have finely textured, shoulder-length hair, but a lot of it, so it seems to take forever to dry it.  My old dryer was pretty heavy, so much so my shoulder would begin to hurt before I could finish.  This past August, I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott while moving my son into his college dorm.  Having to pack lightly for myself, I counted on using whatever dryer the hotel provided.  When I saw how small the Andis Pro Style 1600 dryer in the hotel room was, I was skeptical of its power.  I was pleasantly surprised!  In addition to being lightweight, it was very effective.  I remarked to my husband at how quickly I was able to dry my hair (even with the Florida humidity) and that I wanted one of the dryers.  Since I could get it on Amazon for $13.99, I thought what the heck, I won't be gambling too much if it doesn't work.  I have been using it at least 3 times a week for the last 9 weeks or so without any problems. My dogs did not like it when we used the old dryer on them after a bath, but it is almost as if they like this one! Of course, I do wonder how long a $14 hairdryer will last, but my hairstylist told me Andis is a very reputable brand.  Regardless, it has been worth every penny. Highly recommend!"
We had the previous model for over 5 years.  Worked every day till the heating element broke.  So we had to replace it.  New unit is only improved.  Uses the previous mounting hardware on the wall.  We expect great things for this replacement.
"I recently upgraded my old dryer of 8 years.<br />1. This was slightly heavier than I expected, only because my old one was super light weight. However, the weight is not noticeable other than that. The material of the dryer is pleasant to hold.<br />2. Cute design with two optional add ons is a plus.<br />3. Dries quickly! I can fully dry my thick shoulder length hair in 3-4 minutes.<br />4. Much quieter than my old dryer.<br />5. The only con, is that the buttons sometimes can be pushed when drying the hair because of the way they are positioned on the handle. So, if you do not have a mindful touch while blow drying, you may accidentally switch from high output to low output."
I ordered this when the cord on the same exact one I had became damaged. I had it for about 5 years and didn't want to experiment with other models or brands. Old reliable wins for me!
So far so good. I've had it about 2 months. Cord still retracts and dries my thick hair fast with minimal frizz.
"Better than expected- really great value to price ratio. Did not find any of the issues regarding control buttons. Love the settings, cool setting a big + and a cold button for a burst of chilly air. 2 speeds, 3 setting plus cold button, fantastic air flow, does what it says for a fraction of the price of high end salon brands. Would gladly buy again!"
No more tangled cord! Love this dryer. It is also pretty quiet for it's high wattage. I recommend this dryer.
"Works great, and the cord winds up into the handle at the touch of a button, plus the handle folds down so it takes up less space when it's put away. Solves my pet peeve about hair dryers. I wouldn't use anything else, so I bought an extra one just in case they stop selling these (heaven forbid)."
"&#34;...more than you can afford pal.&#34; is not a phrase you should apply here. It's quieter, blows harder, has ionizer or maybe a deionizer, it's red, has an awesome cord.<br /><br />And did I mention its very quiet? Has more of a whooooooooosh shound than typical shrill hair dryer, &#34;Wheeeeeeee-zzzzzzzzzzzz-eeeeee-zzzzzz-eeee-hrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ddrrrrrrrrrrrrr-wheeeeeeeeesh&#34;"
"I have naturally curly hair that tends to be dry as I get older. When I would get a haircut I would always leave the salon with my hair wet because I thought drying it would cause it to be frizzier, my stylist proved me wrong at my last visit. So now that I knew I could dry my hair and it would look good I searched the dryers for curly hair and read all the reviews and chose the Conair YOU. I really like the fact that I can dry my hair and have it look great in about 15 minutes and that's using the low setting. It also comes with a defuser, which is a key to blowdrying curly hair. This is a great little dryer for naturally curly hair!"
"very strong and powerful hair dryer. a little bit heavy, but i don't mind."
"I have received this product today and used it. This blower makes my hair more manageable, and dried it faster too. I have a thick hair, and although my old blower is not really old (3-4 years old) but it makes my hair  frizzy after I use it. After reading the reviews, I said that I will give it a try, and I am happy that I did. I like this product and I recommended it.   p.s. I also read in some of the reviews that they died after several months so for now I am giving it 5 stars and I will update my review if it breaks since I just used it once."
I bought this for traveling. I have very thick hair that takes a long time to dry. This blow dryer is light weight but still does a good job of drying my hair.
"Lightweight and super fast. With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time. I can't remember the last time that I left the house with a completely dry head of hair...it used to take way too long to dry. Not anymore! I also like the little bling added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model. Worth every penny."
"I love this blow dryer!!! I have never really put much thought into the types of blow dryers I have used in the past. I thought severe breakage, damage and dry hair were the negatives that came with the territory. Boy, was I wrong!!! This blow dryer dries my hair REALLY fast and the results are great! My hair is much silkier and not dry at all! I can almost skip the flat iron, and I have really course/curly hair!!! I have used the dryer twice so far and my breakage has been reduced dramatically!!! This dryer is lightweight and I love the 2 concentrator nozzles that come with it! The cord is nice and long as well!!! Although it was expensive, I think I have found a winner!!! My old &#34;CHI&#34; can't touch this!!!"
"We first encountered this dryer in a hotel room.  My wife used it and immediately fell in love with it.  Small, but it packs a punch. Plenty heat and plenty air volume.  She simply had to have one since her dryer at home was getting sick.  I checked with Amazon and found the identical model we had used at the hotel.  She loves it and it has performed flawlessly for several months now.  We highly recommend this item."
The dryer works very well.  Dries hair quickly. Like the choice of settings  It is rather large so not suitable for travel
Fantastic Blowdryer.<br />Was looking for something that had some heat options and this fit the bill.<br />It actually dries my super thick long hair quicker than my last one.<br />I highly recommend this dryer.
"Usually I buy Conair hair dryers but chose the Andis and it is more powerfull than the Conair even though they are 1875 Watt.  I have not used the attachments because I have short, straight, thick hair that I blow dry and it just falls into place requiring little brushing.  I do believe it is just a bit heavier than the Conair dryer but not so much that causes me a problem.  I am so glad I chose the Andis instead of another Conair.  It was packaged very well and arrived two days after I placed my order.  I would be glad to recommend this Andis 82005 to my family and friends."
"This dries my hair very well, and doesn't cause any frizz. I have naturally thick, long, curly hair, so whenever I decide to straighten my hair, I need to ensure that it dries halfway straightened (I use a flat-iron after I am done drying). The concentrator does an amazing job straightening my curls while leaving my hair without frizz and fly-away hair (I also use One N' Only argan oil to help control frizz). I use the diffuser whenever I want to dry my curls, and I love the way my hair turns out after a few minutes of drying.<br /><br />This purchase was definitely worth it!"
"This hairdryer is fantastic. It is powerful, which means it dries fast, lightweight, and includes many different settings. The extra attachments also help for different types of drying. Although other reviews say it is heavy and bulky, the Andis hairdryer is far from it. I would recommend it for anyone."
"Derby Extra razors are the perfect razors for a beginning double edge shaver. I had tried my razor with the factory Merkur blade, and I got a half-decent shave, but I had to be very careful because the blade would randomly dig into my skin. I switched to Derby, and what a difference a Derby makes.<br /><br />The blades are very sharp- my wife tested them gently dry-shaving a bit of leg hair, and they left an instant bald spot. However, they're not too sharp as some people have said a Feather blade can be- I can even press down on my razor just a bit in trouble areas to get really close results, and not have to worry too much about slicing myself open.<br /><br />If you're just starting out with double edge shaving, do yourself a favor and pick up some Derby blades. The only reason I'll consider switching potentially to find a razor with more economical packaging. Derby blades come in little plastic mini-tubs that are individually wrapped, not to mention the blades are also individually wrapped. I would prefer to be a touch more environmentally conscious and get a paper sleeve full of razors instead of six plastic boxes.<br /><br />When packaging is your biggest concern about a product, you know there's good product in there. Recommended for beginning shavers, or anyone looking for a good workhorse blade."
"This hair dryer is the best one I have been able to find! I have very long and thick hair. It used to take me about and hour and a half to dry my whole head, this dryer got it dry in...wait for it.... About 25 minutes! Old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy! But this blow dryer left my hair almost board straight. I almost didn't have to use the HSI straightener that I bought along with it. I never used to blow dry my hair because of the time it would take plus how frizzy it would leave my hair but now I have blown dried my hair every single time! Totally worth it!"
"I don't use a blow dryer often, but with a new short cut I found I needed to- this blow dryer does wonders in a short time with my curls.... I use the diffuser attachment that came with it.  Super."
"This replaced my previous hair dryer, same brand and model, that had lasted many years.  My wife couldn't live without it."
Bought this for a 2-week trip to Chile.  Worked well on their 220 volt system though it cannot be used on High Heat and High Fan when operating on 220.  Once I got home to the US I moved my current hair dryer to the guest bathroom and am using this one now.  It has a strong fan and the heat options are accurate.<br /><br />The retractable cord and folding handle make it less cumbersome in the suitcase and it's easier to store at home too.
This hair dryer was recommended by my stylist over and above the dryers sold in the salon. This hair dryer has not disappointed! I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly! Worth the $$
I Received This Dryer In A Few Days After Ordering It....And Im So Glad That I Did!!! My Hair Takes A Long Time To Dry Typically; But Not W This Dryer.My Hair Is Very Thick & To Dry It Usually Is A Process. I Love This Dryer Simply Because It Dries My Hair In Record Time.!!! I Would Recommend This Dryer To Anyone.For The Price; This Dryer Is Amazing!!!
Best I've ever bought. I have long thick hair and it only takes about 5-7 minutes to dry with this blow dryer.
I absolutely love this hair dryer. My old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair and now I can dry my hair in 5 mins.
Product arrived quickly and worked as expected in Europe.
I love this Hair Dryer. I have thick long hair and it take around 5 mins to dry my hair.. Love it
"It worked well for me, since I use it everyday. No complaints on this product.  Easy to use and handle"
"Works well so far! I thought I'd give it a try since it was a fairly low price. It was bigger than I thought it would be. So if you're looking for something to travel with, this might be a bit too big. Other than that, this is a really good deal"
"Love the dryer. A funny thing though. I have short hair and the attachment that fluff's up your hair, I have not mastered using it yet. I am afraid I will knock  myself out. My hairdresser and friends laugh at me when I tell them about it. Otherwise, easy to handle and quick to dry."
"My girl ONLY wanted this hair dryer to replace the same one that just died.  Found it here on Amazon FAR cheaper than anywhere else and with Amazon Prime it was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days.  Great price and my girl loves it (she says it dries her thick hair fast and doesn't dry her hair out in the process), so that's it.  Highly recommend!"
I bought this hair dryer for my girlfriend. She has long thick hair and gets tired of all the maintenance it takes. She has been very happy with this product. It works quickly and doesn't damage her hair.
"I'm pretty lazy. I will avoid excess walking at most costs. My ass can prove it.<br />So, we needed a new hair dryer for the changing table (we dry off our baby after we use wet wipes on her butt, and after she gets a bath), and we had to have one that was fast and could have a &#34;just warm&#34; setting. This one is so good that I find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table. Without a mirror, no less. It's that good. So I just need to get a second one now because I can't keep this extra activity up.<br />Oh, and it's loud (I don't know how they'd make one that isn't), but I love the 4 settings (cool slow, warm fast, hot slow, and hotter fast) and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does. Even though it has the same wattage.<br />I also like the fact that it's white. Even if the cord isn't (that's actually annoying to someone like me who bought a white hair dryer because there are only bright colors in the nursery.... and now I have an unsightly black cord sticking out like a sore thumb). I guess you can't have it all."
"This thing really pack a punch. Perhaps they have to make the outlet diameter larger than others so the wind pressure isn't too great on the head and hair. This thing isn't slim but not too big nor too heavy. My just turn teen daughter like it and find it not too big or heavy.<br /><br />From out many broken hair dryers ceramic is certainly heat more even than non-ceramic ones. But since we mainly use it to dry rather than style, I'm not sure fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic. There is only one rocker button for cool / turbo. The other buttons are large slide buttons so you can't accidentally change the settings. The finish is quality hard glossy plastic. I will not buy non-slip rubbery finishes again as they degenerate in no time.<br /><br />So far so good for a couple of months. But I think they realized that they made a big mistake by not marketing it only to salons, with a price to match. I would love to have another one to replace my daughter's broken one but now it sells for 10 times the price I paid."
"Let me first explain two things-<br />One being that I work the nightly re-stock shift at Sephora and have my pick of any high end professional hair dryer at 30-50% off sale costs and I still chose this for many reasons. Secondly, I have used the same Revlon Ionic $15-20 blowdryer since I was about 16years old and never had any problems with it. I always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so.<br /> My hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave. My hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when I blew it dry but I just figured that was part of the drying process. One day while at work I was looking at a T3 and discussing how my hair frizzes, i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer. I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general. I wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it. After ONE use I could tell a huge difference. It doesnt dry my hair any faster though. I dont have any frizz and it is smoother, smells better, not to hot to touch, and a lot more shine! I really do recommend this to any woman (or man) who is considering buying a new expensive blowdryer and cant make up their mind...go with this one first!"
"LOVE this hairdryer!! I keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing I've done differently is to start using this blow dryer (with no cut or professional styling in months)! The small diffuser was a tight fit at first, but the more I've used it, the easier it's gotten. I guess the little tabs had to be rubbed down a bit. Never had a problem with the curling diffuser. 2 months in and am satisfied so far!"
I received the Hair Dryer today.  I used it on my daughters hair and it worked just as promised.  I am African American and this is the first hair dryer that I have purchased that has actually lived up to its claims.  My daughter has thick hair and this dryer literally cut the drying time in half.  The handle is comfortable to hold and the attachments work perfectly.  Also this hair dryer is much quieter than older models similar to this one.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone who hates long drying times.  It gets the job done and it gives your hair a natural shine.
"I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it's frizzy & I need to flat iron it.  I was AMAZED by this hair dryer!  I used the comb attachment & after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed!!!  It was straight & shiny.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!"
"This is my second time buying Ivory Caps - I went wiith the 3 bottles deal this time. I had taken it for about 2 months and had noticed a great difference not only in the reduction of dark spots and uneven skin tone but also in the smoothness and texture of my skin.  I appears smoother and softer especially on my face.  My skin appears healthier and a small scar above my eye appears lighter and less noticable.  I take 2-3 capsules daily with a glass of orange juice for the vitamin C content.  I find this works best. People, this is the real deal! I would absolutely recommend this product."
"My husband (firefighter) had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter until it cooled off.  Everytime I walked into the bathroom, there'd be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it so I'd wind up the cord and put it in the cabinet. EVERYDAY.  So for Christmas, I got hubby this blowdryer and we all love it.  Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  The kids can all use it easily (5 yrs and up), simple on/off button on the base, hi/lo on the dryer handle and it gets put away -- right away.  It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet and I love it!"
Excellent First  Introduced to this product at several 5 star hotels and figured it must be durable and it is.  One has lasted 5+ years with near daily use. New one is for guests. Have read a few negative reviews and figured customers got a lemon  It happens!
"I was looking for a travel hairdryer.  This is the ONLY hairdryer that I could find that had the retractable cord.  That does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle.  The handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily.  No buttons etc.  It does stay in place when using it.  Super duper drying power!<br />Product Dimensions: 4.1 x 8.1 x 6.1 inches ; 1.6 pounds<br />That said it is bigger and heavier than I wanted for travel but getting smaller like I have had in the past (and can't find) didn't work nearly as well.  I am one half star down because the size seems large for travel which would be the point of the design I would think.<br />All in all, its a great dryer and the best I have found for travel and function."
"This is an incredibly powerful hair dryer for the size.  For years I have run across this exact hair dryer at 5 star hotels all across the country & Caribbean.  I have really long, thick hair & always dreaded using the cheaply hotel dryers because they took FOREVER to dry my hair. This one worked like a charm time & time again.<br /><br />Finally, I looked it up & couldn't believe how inexpensive it was. I ordered 1 for my house & 2 for my beach house. Had them almost 2 years now & they still work great!!<br /><br />My only issue is that the retractable cord gets where it won't retract sometimes, but the dryer is still powerful & works like a charm!"
I have had 2 of these for a couple of years. The one that is used by 3 people daily finally went. Bought again because its convenient and has decent power. Added a third one to my daughters room to free up the bathroom.
"I have owned this dryer for two and a half years and it still work perfectly.<br /><br />All dryers seem to be the same with a fan, a heating element a stay cool body and some controls. This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast."
"i love the cord keeper Conair dryers.  Much easier to store.  My old Conair cord keeper (less expensive, 2 speed, 2 heat settings) wore out at the plug.  Couldn't be without a blow dryer so looked to trusty Amazon.  I saw this model and read the reviews.  I liked that it had a cool setting and didn't have to keep,the button pushed for the cool shot.  I also like that it has the cord keeper.  But the best feature about it, in my opinion, is that it is MUCH QUIETER than the less expensive model.  I get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum, compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes.  If a quieter blow dryer is what you're looking for, with 1875 power, this is your dryer.  Worth the extra money!!!  Buy it, you won't be sorry!  Super fast delivery!  Ps, use the concentrator nozzle, cuts down on frizz."
"I first bought this hair dryer because of the positive reviews left by other reviewers with thick hair. In the morning, I don't want to spend 20 minutes just making sure my hair is dry before I leave. I want some time to style, too.<br /><br />This hair dryer has a professional quality motor (1875 watt AC motor) which translates to stronger air flow, hotter air, and less drying time. That's exactly what I wanted and that's what I got. This hairdryer, with the airflow concentrator attachment, dried my hair in under 7 minutes, which is unheard of for me. It has 3 heat settings, 2 fan speeds, and a cool air shot button.<br /><br />BONUS: This hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others I've owned. It's still a hair dryer, so it'll make noise, but this one's noises are hushed.<br /><br />Besides its speedy drying, it's just a really pretty hair dryer. It's got an attractive black matte finish that's soft to the touch. It also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet, yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine."
"Sweet, works as expected!"
I LIKE AND IT WAS VERY AFFORDABLE.I USED IT TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WAS PLEASED.I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT BUT IT SAVED ME MONEY:-)
Works really good.. Thought it was bigger though.. It has a small nozzle. But it definitely gets the job done.
I bought this Conair when my old one finally blew.  After 10 year mind you.  I have short hair but need something with a couple heat and blow settings.  This does the trick.  There are two speed settings and three heat.  That gives you enough combinations to do the trick.  Takes me only 5 minutes to dry and style my hair.  It also has a &#34;cool&#34; button which is easy to reach.  The hook on the handle makes it easy to hang if you need to.
"I researched a LOT of hair dryers, wanting one that wasn't too noisy and that had BOTH temperature and fan settings-- Found it!! This is the one!! It wasn't as expensive as some that just seemed like more than I needed. It does the job I need it to, in a short amount of time, w/o frying my hair!  It's not the Large size so it fits easily in my suitcase and travels well. I love the matte finish, which keeps it from sliding off the counter-- just feels solid in my hand without being heavy!"
"My wife is happy with it, that's all I needed! Seems to work fine, and I noticed it's not as loud and annoying as some other one's my wife had before!"
"This hair dryer is small but its engine is powerful!!! I take it to gym, travel and daily hair routine."
"This is my second Portofino 6600.  My daughter and I have thick, long, curly hair.  This dryer cuts down the drying time by more than half.  The first is still going strong after two years of daily heavy use.  Also very pleased  with the diffusser and concentrating attachments.  This dryer has by FAR outperformed other well known brands costing two or more times the price.  I would do commercials for this dryer!"
"broke my arm and went on vacation so this little gadget hellped a lot. It will not hold a heavy dryer, but worked fine with a travel dryer.Suction will not work on a porous surface but did fine on a mirror or glass shower door."
"No sales puffing with this product.  It performs exactly as marketed and fits into small spaces.  The retractable cord was a selling point for me, and it drys my hair quickly and thoroughly.  I would have no reservation recommending this unit."
item arrived promptly and so far it works as promised. dries as quickly as can be expected for the price we paid.
Purchased this travel iron after my previous one burned up.  This one is compact and I love the retractable cord.  I have VERY thick hair and was pleased to find a travel iron with 1875 watts.
"My hair stylist recommended this product, and had me start on it before I started chemo, during it, and after it was over.  Even though it was tough and sad to put on my scalp during the process, having no hair, I'm glad I did.  It sort of gave me reassurance that yes, someday I would have hair again.  After a year of having to wear a hot wig, when my hair did come back, it came back VERY strong and full!!!   I'm not real big on the minty smell, but I definitely would recommend the product, and gave it to a friend that was going to be going through chemo too."
I put these in Rv's because they fit in a tight spot and work well.  Glynnsrv.com
"This dryer is even better than the one my stylist uses, he's SO jealous!  Takes me half as long to dry my long thick hair now, and it's not as frizzy either.  GREAT dryer!  OH, and it's SO quiet too, I don't have to worry about waking anyone in the next room when I do my hair."
"Small enough to travel but powerful, I like it better than my regular Revlon I was using for 3 years."
"Soory to have to say I bought this for a Christmas gift for a little girl. As far as I know, it has been fine."
"Only been using this for about a week now so I can't speak to the longevity of the dryer but I really love it so far.  Hair dryers have always been kind of hit and miss, mostly miss for me.  They are usually not strong enough, or too hot, or not hot enough, or cheaply made (even expensive ones), etc.  I have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry.  This dryer is amazing.  It has several settings and on the hottest, strongest setting I can dry my hair faster than any other dryer I've had.  But it doesn't get overly hot either.  I don't feel like I'm burning my hair and scalp as I have with other dryers.  As someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades, I feel like I finally found one.  I'm tempted to buy a bunch so I have them for the future in case this one ever goes away."
"I originally bought this model hangup hair dryer because of the cord hanger. In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying."
"In addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer, it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology.  One other reviewer said that it burnt out after 2 weeks, but if it lasts I would definitely recommend it."
"As a man I take pride in always being ready at a moments notice, but if you have a girlfriend you know that's not always true and sitting around waiting for her to get ready can be a pain when all you want to do is get to the party and have a few beers with your friends, with this bad boy she can dry/do her hair in 20mins or less (not including shower time, make up time and dress up time) Imagine waiting only an hour instead of 3! This has saved me time, money on the electric bill, and my relationship, plus chicks love leopard print, and it works great on my dogs (don't tell my gf)"
"She needed a new one, so I surprised her with this one. She absolutely loves it. Its the only thing she uses."
"I bought this for my sister, to replace her ancient conair hair dryer. She has super thick long hair and the old one did her well for years and years, so when it finally died, it only seemed natural to ty and find one by the same brand. Well, she loves this thing, it is super light and powerful. The diffuser makes all the difference in the world. Don't be afraid to buy this, you will be happy"
"You can choose hot, warm, or cold air in high or low airflow. The long cord allows you to move freely."
"Really small, but does a good job of drying. I just wish there was a diffuser -my other Conair one kinda fits so I use it, but it falls on the floor sometimes."
This is a terrific unit. It has separate heat and power adjustments.  Can be strong or gentle. Dried my thick medium length hair in 3 minutes. Every bit as good as units costing 4x as much. Why would you buy anything else? My previous Conair lasted over 10 years.
"After 12 years, my old (exactly the same) dryer died - it didn't owe me a thing.  I was pleased to find the same design still available.  We have a small bathroom so I don't have the space to leave a dryer on a counter, and I'm certainly not going to take one out each morning and put it away after use.  This is so darn convenient!"
"I love this hairdryer. It does blow HARD on the high setting, which is exactly what I wanted. I also love the hot, medium and cold settings. You can set it there and go on your way - unlike other hairdryers where you have to hold down a &#34;cold&#34; button to get the cold air. I try to use the medium setting as much as possible to limit the heat damage to my hair. The only thing that would make this hairdryer better is a retractable cord! :-D"
It gets my long hair dry in record time without drying it out!!  I love the cool down button as well.
"I purchased this because the sidewalks at my workplace are very uneven, and every time it rains we get huge puddles that cannot be avoided. My shoes always get drenched, and I needed a way to quickly and easily dry them. For that purpose, I've found this hair dryer to be very useful and efficient. I also use it to warm my socks in the winter. There's no better feeling than being out in the cold with warm feet.<br /><br />I can't speak to its intended purpose, as I don't have hair and so have not used it to dry my hair. Please don't hold this against me."
I have very long thick hair that is chemically straightened and high lighted. Usually I go through 2-3 hair dryers a year and never get my hair completely dry.... Until this dryer. It is AMAZING!!! Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer. My hair was COMPLETELY dry in 15 minutes. Save yourself time and money and buy this dryer. My only regret is not buying it sooner! Great price and will definitely buy another to have as a spare.
"This machine is amazing! Works like a charm. I have long, thick hair (down my back). This thing dries my hair in 3 minutes -- I have timed it. It used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Sturdy design, and the light pink buttons add a nice touch too."
"I asked my hairdresser if dryers made a difference and she went on and on about the one she used- which is this one. She said she even takes it home evenings and weekends to use on her own hair. Bad news- it cost about $350! I wrote down the model and thought i would just see what I could find. I couldn't believe it when I found it on here for under $100! I got it within three days of placing my order and tried it right away. It was truly amazing the difference it made with my hair. I have thinner hair with a natural wave so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy so I usually use a round brush with a dryer to straighten and smooth it. With this dryer, it was shinier and smoother in half the time. I have been able to come close to how it looks when it is professionally blown out. For all those who don't think a dryer makes a difference - I'm telling you this one did for me. Couldn't be happier with the purchase."
Lets just say...I no longer need to go to the hair salon to get my hair done. It dries your hair super fast and its not heavy to use.<br />In the beginning I had to get use to using it but  after a few tries I mastered blowing out my hair just like they do in the hair salon. I highly recommended!!!
"Great dryer! Lighter weight and less damaging than my old one. This is being picky, but I wish the switched the positions of the power and heat setting buttons. I hold the dryer in my left hand and the brush in my right (do other righties do this?). My left thumb is closest to the heat setting button (that I never change) and farther away from the on/off switch (which I use between every section of hair. The result? Accidentally switching the hear setting to &#34;blast furnace&#34; and burning my scalp. Conair, one little change, please!"
"So far this works great. I read some complaints about it not being powerful enough, but that's to be expected with a QUIET hair dryer. I live in a townhouse so I would prefer a quiet one over a powerful one, so it works great for me. It is also really convenient having it hang on the wall. Hanging it up was a little annoying, primarily because a screwdriver that uses bits is too wide to fit in the holes, but once I borrowed a regular screwdriver from work it went okay. I would say the high on this dryer is a little more powerful than the low on a regular one, but it still only takes me about 3-4 minutes to dry my waist long thin hair."
Used on my 5 yr old with African American natural hair. Does a super job especially when used in combination with a smoothing serum. When I use this dryer I'm cool with delaying flat ironing. Just ponytail her up.
"This drier has been working great for me for the last few months and I'm pretty sure I am using it harder than most.  I have it out at the barn with my horse and use it it dry him off after a workout and a bath.  This means that while it is only working on short hair, it has a lot of surface area to cover and it holds up the whole time.  Only bad thing I have to say is that the less than ideal environment with lots of dirt has caused me to see a fleck of rust or two on the front grill, but they don't  seem to be spreading and they haven't given me any trouble."
My wife was trying different brands of blow dryers for years. She was not impressed at all. Till our hair stylist receommended Elchim professional and my wife noticed the difference right away. She is very pleased.
"I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!"
"I purchased this dryer many years ago from a retail store.  As stated &#34;many years ago&#34;.  Easy to handle , great choices of temperatures and speed .  It finally gave out.  I tried a few other dryers,---full sized and small. and none could  compared to this mighty dryer.  Returned the other and then purchased this through Amazon.  Five stars..... !!!!!!!"
"I have thick, not coarse, but not silky hair.  I rarely blow dry my hair since it takes so long (maybe 7-10 minutes) with my old hair dryer, and I thought it made my hair coarser.  I decided to give the ion thing a try though, and it was the best investment (in time) ever.  It only takes  two or three minutes on high speed, medium heat to dry an entire head of shoulder-length hair!  (I don't blow until it's bone dry, just dry to the touch.)  After the first time, my hair was super soft.  After the second time, it got even softer and I thought it had more body too.  I've only had it a week, so we'll see how it holds up, but the ions really do work.  I'll probably never air dry again!"
I am in love with WEN!  I have very thin hair and was starting to loose a little every week or so.  It has stopped falling out and my hair looks and feels great.
"Bought this hair dryer for my wife to replace her old one that was starting to physically wear out. This one dried her hair several minutes faster than the old one (even with hair/dust cleaned out of the filter). Highly recommend, the finish is a soft touch / satiny plastic paint / coating that feels good to hold in your hand."
"Normally it takes me 1/2 hour to dry my long hair, but now only 15 minuites with this FHI 2000 hair dryer. Also, my hair is silky to the touch afterward.  The weigh of this dryer I feel a little bit heavy at first, but it's solid.  I bought this dryer in pink color before, and this black one is for my sister as X'mas gift.  I hope she will like it as much as I do.  Great service from Amazon.  Fast delivery-about a week.  Nice packaging-no damage at all.  Thank you!"
"When i had moved in with my gf, she had brought along one of those cheap Oral-B Vitality Electric Toothbrushes. She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode."
"I've been using this dryer for a couple weeks and I feel good about my purchase. I'm not seeing dramatic frizz reduction or anything but it does seem to have helped  a bit with my flyaway prone hair. I can definitely say that it is faster than my old dryer, and I'm amazed at how quiet it is!  I wish it was a bit smaller as it is sort of hard to store but other than that I am very happy."
"I like how much air and heat this hairdryer puts out. I have a ton of hair that takes ages to dry, but that time is much shorter with this hairdryer.<br /><br />The only downside is that I wish the cord was longer! My old hairdryer had a much longer cord and I was spoiled by it."
"When I ordered this styler I thought I was getting the (older) one that folds. The two models look very similar - I would think they are the same unless I look very closely at the picture. The reason why I was getting an extra one was because I was very satisfied with the old model - Light, small, dual-voltage, strong.<br /><br />This newer model works the same and looks the same. It just doesn't fold. The folding one is actually, IMHO, easier to bring when traveling."
"Wow.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!<br /><br />The Technology<br />Rather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.<br /><br />The Results<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.<br /><br />Before you use:<br />You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)<br /><br />5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!d some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).

The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)<br /><br />5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!"
"I love this blow dryer! I was hesitant to spend more than $20, but so glad I did! I have naturally curly hair and I notice my hair is way less frizzy! I did not notice it being heavy at all. Seemed same weight as my old blow dryer. The noise is about average. I wouldn't say it is quiet, but it's not too loud either. About the same as any other hair dryer I've used."
The ceramic dryer made drying my hair much easier than ever before. It cut my time down drastically and no more tangles at all. I love this hair dryer!
works as expected.  Love the zebra print zipper pouch it comes with.  Arrived quickly and price was very competetive.  Keeping it in my suitcase for travelling as it is small.  Small but quite powerful.
"Very light weight, easy to use with one hand as you round brush with the other... and overall was above my expectations!"
"I researched several ionic ceramic hair dryers and ended up with this one and I am in love. I'm glad I didn't spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket. I have thick hair and if I were to let it air dry, it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it. I love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser. I use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush. I'm literally amazed at how fast I can dry my hair with this thing and I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner."
"I love anything that can put away the cord in a snap and dries my hair half the time as my other regular hair dryer - they are right, ionic technology does work!  I have no regrets buying this item.  It works as advertised!"
"We picked a wall mount because she was always leaving her hair dryer plugged in, right next to the sink (that's a terrible accident just waiting to happen).  After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).  It comes with a wall template with a leveling line which makes the job go especially quickly."
"Love this little blow dryer, works like a regular size dryer!!!"
"a little big than I think ,but just ok"
"Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don't have to straighten my hair after. My hair is thick, wavy and frizzy. It also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes.  So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search. And it was half the price of the Sedu!"
"This is the best dryer I have ever used. It isn't all that quiet, and though it's not really heavy, it is bigger than I'm used to and so still a bit unwieldy in my unpracticed hands, but it dries my thick, coarse, shoulder-length hair faster than any other device I have ever used. It also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers. The Allure would seem to offer the benefits of an expensive professional tool at a surprisingly reasonable price. Hoping it holds up over time, and planning to purchase another to keep at my summer cottage."
"I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  I was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer I have had as a back up.  I have not been disappointed.  It has a nice feel, is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality dryer."
"When I ordered the anti-aging eye roller I thought, yeah sure, this will be like any other product that advertises the reduction of eye bags and puffiness. But, and I mean a big BUT, I found that it really does reduce the appearance of bags and puffiness.  I am glad I tried it and I am glad it is an OLAY product because I use OLAY exclusively for face and body.  Anyway, I would and have recommended this product to others so they can try it and other OLAY products.  I don't mind asking, because I am on a fixed income, for coupons, very substantial coupons for OLAY products.  I also like the regenerist moisturizer which I use at least twice a day.  Thank you."
"THIS DRYER IS EXTREMELY HIGH POWERED. IT IS SOMEWHAT HEAVY, BUT I LOVE THE GRIP OF IT AND ITS PROBABLY SLIGHTLY HEAVY BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIGH POWERED AND FAST DRYING"
"I bought this because I just moved and have been using my sister's hair dryer up to this point. I couldn't afford to spend a lot of extra money and I am already purchasing a million things for my new apartment, but being a female with thick, long hair and bangs, I *needed* a hair dryer. I was skeptical to purchase something so cheap, but really: WOW. This is perfect for me. It blows strongly on high, the heat is quite warm, and the cold setting is fantastic.<br /><br />I bought this for $8 and am SO happy about it. Don't waste your money on a more expensive one. I really don't see the point."
"Very quiet as advertised, a huge improvement over the last one my wife had that certainly was bad for her hearing.  Also produces good air speed and heat, both of which my wife was nervous about ahead of time."
"I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is powerful, quiet and dries my hair in less time than previous dryers.<br />I have the Elchim for European current and thought it worked so well that I decided to buy one that uses US current.<br />I  highly recommend this Elchim product!"
"While the flat iron is coming apart in less than a year, this hair dryer seems to be a better product so far."
This blow dryer is the greatest hair tool I've purchased in a long time. I can do my daughters hair now with ease and less pulling out of our thick curly hair!
I use warm setting to dry and style and the cold setting to set. The product works great for my needs. I plan on using this for trips and a back up at home in case my other hair dryer quits working.
"There's a lot of low reviews for this hair dryer and most are because it's loud. Yes, it is loud. I don't use a hair dryer to style my hair I just want it to dry it as quickly as possible. I have long hair to my lower back, its (mostly) straight and very fine hair. I part my hair in the middle. Then turn it on to the highest speend and hot. I dry my left side in 5 mins then my right side- another 5 mins. This is the 3rd time I've bought this hair drier. The 1st one died when I dropped it. R.I.P. The second one just died after 5 years... It wouldn't heat up. 5 years for $20.. That's a good deal to me. If you're looking for a fancy hair dryer to carfeully and (apparently) silently... continue looking. If you're looking for a hair dryer that will dry your hear in 10-15 mins (if you have thick hair) then this one could be it."
"The hairdryer works just as it was described.  It is small and compact, so it's much more easy to handle than drug store hairdryers.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone who has long, thick hair (I have long, very thick, dry and damaged hair).<br /><br />I would also like to say that I will be a faithful Amazon customer for any products I need and Amazon carries.  I was blow drying my hair when the hairdryer fell to the floor and broke.  I contacted Amazon and, without even questioning me about why the hairdryer broke, Amazon replaced it at no charge and it was delivered in two days!  I am extremely impressed with Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.  I really appreciate your customer service."
"I have this same hair dryer in the purple/pink shade, and got this for my mom as a gift.<br /><br />I've had my hair dryer for about three months now and I use it daily, and it's still going strong. It is a powerful hair dryer, and yes, it is loud-but it has a low setting if that bothers you.<br /><br />I don't see what the hype is about this dryer being really heavy as I've read all over the reviews; it's not light but certainly not weighing my arm down either. It cuts my drying time literally in half, so who cares? The 'cool shot' button works really well which was also a huge plus for me. This dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won't fail as easily. Overall, it's a solid product and I've been very happy with mine.<br /><br />Side Note: Conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them, which sealed the deal for me for a $30 dryer. I called and asked Conair about this directly before I purchased mine through Amazon. It doesn't matter it's through a third party."
"This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)o I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

Works like a professional hair dryer should.
wow
Suits my needs very well. Quiet and compact.
"I read some bad reviews on this hair dryer but so far I have not had any problems with it. I actually love it, cute colors and drys well"
I can't believe how this hair dryer made my hair feel so soft and not frizzy.
Very convenient mounted on our bathroom wall next to the mirror over the sink.
so far no problems with it just a bit heavier but nothing else...
"Although I bought this for travel, I like it more then my regular sized dryer.<br />Its pink but appears purple in the picture, thats the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5."
"My wife loves it, much easier to handle than her old 1850 Watt hair dryer, and doesn't pop our circuit breaker as it draws only 15 amps."
I had to replace my 8 year old Turbo Power and didn't even consider purchasing a different brand. It dries and straightens my very curly hairy in no time with salon quality.
I have had this for over a year and it still works great<br />the cold button works fast<br />the cleaning sheild is a great feature to remove lint
"La nano-cer&aacute;mica i&oacute;nica seca el cabello tecnolog&iacute;a como ninguna otra. En vez de seco, paja-como el pelo seco el Andis proporciona un secado flexible y suave que hace que el pelo se siente muy sano y natural."
"It is faster compared to my old one, the cord doesn't use extra space as it rolls inside, which I find very convenient."
Bought this for my brother for Christmas.  He really likes it.  It is now discontinued but he said that Curves is the same fragrance
"Yes, this looks like a hair dryer from a hotel and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of hotels used this.  It's well-built and light-weight.  Nothing fancy - on/off, high/low air and heat."
"I thought I could never replace my Baby Bliss Professional; however, this product has taken the lead."
Great purchase. I have thick hair. Hair dried well and felt silky too.
"So, I like quiet, powerful hairdriers. My last one broke, and I ordered this one. It does what it needs to."
"This does exactly what I need it to, it's really quiet which is nice, but still does it's job. Quick drying process and I have notoriously hard to dry hair, so I'm please with this purchase. It doesn't get too hot like other dryers I haven't had any issues with burning myself by staying on one spot too long."
"Everyone should own this hair dryer.  Throws out a lot of heat, works very well with Afro-American hair. The comb is very strudy. Only complaint it is somewhat heavier than what I expected."
it does everything a good dryer should do.  The retractable cord doesn't work as well as it should unfortunately but can be managed.
"I wasn't in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one. He thought the dryer just needed to 'rest' for a bit and then it would be 'fine' . . . so he didn't bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink! I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour!<br />FYI: If you, too, have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer, for that purpose, I suggest you point him in the direction of the [[ASIN:B00004TI25 Milwaukee 6 Dual Temperature Heat Gun]]. If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a 'Very Important Family Event' scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!) looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck! I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn't dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I'm over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.<br />I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own. Oh, by the way, my Hot Tools Hair Dryer doesn't look too bad chained to the wall in our bathroom! ~ Mrs. B."
"Wow.  This thing is great!<br /><br />No, it's not as powerful or capable as a &#34;full-sized&#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.<br /><br />One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &#34;auto-ranging&#34; or &#34;universal&#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.<br /><br />Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &#34;professional&#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel."
"I had an older model of this same hair dryer for several years (5-7?) and it was great. Recently, it started making some funny sounds while in use, so I decided it was about time to upgrade. For the price, there's really no better option than this one - it's relatively lightweight, easy to maneuver, and makes quick work of drying my long, thick hair. I've never had an expensive, fancy hair dryer, so I can't speak to whether this is better or not, but I'd say you can't beat the price for the quality."
I was in desperate need of a new hair dryer. I read several different reviews on Amazon.com and decided to go with the Remington D-2012. I am very happy with my decision! I have been using the hair dyer now for a few weeks now and have definitely noticed a difference in my hair. The dryer leaves my hair feeling really soft and super shiny.  It would be great if it was a little lighter (weight-wise) but I would not say it is heavy at all.
Bought it for her for the birthday.  It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  Makes a racket but they all do.  The thing I read about it being hard to get to the buttons is kind of ridiculous.  They are not difficult to push/ avoid pushing unless you have the most sausage of sausage fingers.  Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.
"This is my second version of this hair dryer.  The first one I used for several years and it finally gave up the ghost.  I like the fact that it folds to a small size and it gets hot enough to actually style my hair.  I hope this one lasts as long as the first one.  I have had a couple of travel hair dryers, but this one is better by far.  One good feature is this one does not have such a loud, high pitched scream as most small hair dryers.  The cold air button is also a BIG plus, since I use that when styling my hair with a round brush.  Overall, this is a great product."
Came with great attachments! Love the long cord that doesn't get tangled I have long thick hair which usually takes forever to dry. But with this blow dryer takes me only 10 mins !
"It does the job well, but it is a little heavier than I'd like it to be.  I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  There are no exposed screws on which my hair can get caught, as there were on other dryers I've tried to use.  I've always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception."
I bought this to bring with me to Europe. The size is perfect and i have long thick hair and this small hair dryer dried my hair pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend!
"If anyone is hesitating about whether or not to purchase this hair dryer, you'll be sorry if you don't get it! My hair is naturally curly, but it's a frizzy curl so I often like to blow dry it straight. This dryer is by far the best dryer I have ever used on my hair. Not only does it dry fast, but my hair looks shiny too, and the best part is it holds all day! The only negative thing I can say about this dryer is that the function buttons are on the inside grip, so I'm constantly pushing the buttons when I'm holding the dryer, a bad design. Otherwise, I love this dryer!"
"Let me address the title of the review. From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too."
"T3 makes the best hair dryers. This is my third T3 dryer...the first I had for 4yrs it only broke after being dropped for the tenth time, the second I had for 2yrs it shorted out on vacation in Cuba (no fault of the dryers just my own stupidity, they are made well & to last) and this third T3 I've had for 1yr. I have long, thick, corse, frizz prone hair & used to burn out other hair dryers in only a few uses whereas these T3 dryers dry it super fast with no frizz & it looks shiny after and they last forever. The concentrated nozzle is great for smooth looks and I love the diffuser for beachy waves. Invest in this dryer and you won't be sorry, just don't take it on vacation & it will last for years and years."
"In with the new, out with the old! At first, when it didn't roar like my old one I thought I had bought a dud, but then it worked faster, with less heat, and less air. I love it. I only wish it had a retractable cord."
"Love this dryer! Looks sharp, cut my hair drying time in half!"
I bought this blowdryer in 2004 and it always made my hair silky and shiny. This one which is advertised as the same exact thing doesn't work the same. My hair is always looking dry and burnt. I wouldn't recommend buying this blowdryer. It is the same as any cheap blowdryer you can buy at Cvs.
"I needed a small hair dryer that would fit in a guest bathroom vanity drawer, and this one not only fit but also works well.  With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.<br /><br />This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the &#34;cool&#34; button at the top of the handle.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you're visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I've never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.<br /><br />On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.  Although most hotels supply hair dryers these days, it works well for those times when either you're not sure you'll find one and when you want to depend on something you know.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
"My mom is a cosmetologist & has always supplied me with professional grade dryers for my thick, heavy hair. This one works better than any other professional dryer I have tried. The cost was more reasonable too."
"I am a Fan of T3 items for years, This dryer seems to dry my hair very fast, leaving it shiny"
"Works very well so far.  Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.<br />I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.<br />Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.<br />Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a &#34;hidden&#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived."
"Better than my wife's old one. The hair dryer that she had was pretty expensive, but it finally died. I read the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it as a replacement. She loves it. The new hair dryer is quieter and she loves the cool dry feature. Can't beat it for the price and how it works."
"Update:  :(  3rd time using it on travel.  Love this little dryer.... fits great in my hand, easy control.... 3/4 finished with a blow dry,  hair soft waves and then......... oh no!!!!  it died.  Not circuit tripped. I pushed the reset, I plugged into other outlets....  I was in denial.  i just shook it and then, headed out to Walmart with my 3/4 blown out hair, with the one section not done in a french braid.  :)  LOL....  alas, back to a big dryer.  I really liked this but only got to use it 3 times.<br />_____<br />Purchased for travel because of it's small size. Also purchased to use with Soft Hood Dryer attachment.  Wow this little dryer is quite powerful.  the switch was a little stiff to turn on at first and if feels a little cheap but Torumaliine ceramic, little power house.  love it."
"I don't really like hair dryers because of the noise factor and the energy use, however sometimes I need one.  I used this one at my place of employment (I teach water classes) and found it does the job. It is small enough to travel easily."
"I bought this hair dryer because it is the one my hair stylist uses in her salon. And, since it's such a strong dryer, it takes much less time to dry my hair. Also, it does a better job than any other hair dryer I have ever owned."
Arrived in time. I've only had it for one month so I'm not sure how long it will last but so far I've had no problems. This hair dryer is great. I'm not sure if it is as good as the more expensive brands as I have never paid over $20 for one but it definitely gets the job done. Oh and I looove the retractable cord.
I suffer from carpal tunnell syndrome.  I have had surgery but still have no strength for long periods of time.  Holding my hair dryer was really hard to do over a minute or two.  This product saved the day.  It is sturdy and accomodates my blowdryer really well even though it is a big one.  I would most certainly recomend this product to anyone.
"I love this dryer. I was first introduced to it when we stayed at a very upscale hotel. I wrote down the information and ordered on on Amazon when I returned home. It was a little pricey but some things are just worth it. The only down side for me is the placement of the buttons. I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  I sometimes accidently hit the off button as I am drying my hair. It is not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying. Nice wattage and fast drying. I would purchase it again, although maybe their newer models have the button relocated. Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost. I would recommend the product and the seller."
"In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other &#34;quiet&#34; dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer. I was not compensated for my review. I bought the dryer after researching. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
"Just used my new hair dryer for the first time and ran, yes--ran, to write this review.  I cannot believe this is my hair!  I have shoulder-length, course, thick, curly hair which I blow dry and iron.  I have always used high-end hair dryers, but this is the best ever.  Worth twice the price!  Not only did my hair dry faster, but it dried frizz-free.  I did not have to flat iron it after blowing it dry.  First time ever not having to flat iron.  My hair looks like it does when I come from the hair dresser.  I can't believe a hair dryer can make this big of a difference, but I can assure you, it does.  Thank you Sedu.  I am a believer."
"In my small bathroom, space on the vanity counter is at a premium, this wall mounted unit works works well to take care of the problem.<br /><br />It was easy to mount.  I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),<br /><br />The unit has two heat settings and two speed settings."
So far this hair dryer is amazing.  I love the various settings which allows for less frizz.  It is heavier than my last hair dryer I owned (different brand) but I think it is because it is better constructed.  Drying time does seem a bit faster but hard to tell as my hair is thick.
"Just pyrchased this, but it works well.  Low is hot enough for thin hair.  Med is hor and Hot is super hot!  My old dryer similar to this lasted years.  We'll see about this one."
Purchased this for my daughter and it works fantastic!  Small size but gets the job done. Plenty of power and airflow. Areal winner!
"OMG I love this dryer.  I have thick short hair and asked my stylist what dryer to get next.  I had a cheap drugstore one that had lasted years but was on its last legs.  I have really hesitated to spend a ton of money on a dryer but went ahead and bought this since my birthday was coming up.  I read the reviews before completing the transaction and thought the people who said it dries their hair faster must be crazy.  How would one dryer dry hair significantly faster than another?<br /><br />The answer is I don't know, but it does.  It absolutely does.  I am a convert!  I LOVE this dryer.  I love how small it is.  I packed it on a trip recently and didn't have to stress about how much room it took up in my suitcase.  It is so compact and powerful.  I just adore it.<br /><br />I'm not great at reviewing products I feel strongly about so the fact that I'm even writing this should tell you something.  This dryer really is different than other dryers out there and the higher price is worth every penny.  When you can shave time off of your morning routine every single day, imagine how much of your life you get back?  Now, is that worth extra money?  I am a wash and go girl with little to no interest in makeup, fashion, etc.  I am a mom of three and own a small quilting business.  But I wash my hair every day and have to dry it to tame it.  That process has gone from fast to lightening fast thanks to this Sedu."
"this hair dryer works very well. this a very inexpensive hair dryer and I have been told it will not last very long. i do not use it to dry my hair(buzz cut). i use it for household projects, when i need to dry whatever i am working on. most recently, i used it to adhere plastic over my windows to keep out the draft during the winter. once in awhile you need a hair dryer in the house, even though you do not use it to dry your hair. this hair dryer is powerful and will do the job."
"being a professional hairstylist i got so tired of expensive blowdryers that dont dry the hair any better than the cheap ones. THEN, i read the reviews for this dryer and again i thought, yeah right. SOOO, i bought it and i must say, this blow dryer rocks. it dries the hair in half the time and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! FINALLY, i found one that delivers on its promise"
"This hair dryer works super well. I don't find the sound level much different from other hair dryers as some have complained. I appreciate all of the different settings (3 heat settings, Hi/Med/Low power, and teh different Wattage rankings). The concentrater actually stays on the dryer, which is not what I have experienced in the past. Also, the cord retraction is not perfect; it sometimes  leaves an extra 6 inches out, but I actually find it better than other cord retraction models. Since it is a full size blow dryer, I don't expect it to be compact and the additional cord is a non-issue for me. Glad I happened upon this model."
"Bought for trip but tried out before hand to make sure that it would work on my trip. This dryer woks better than my regular dryer and is not too loud.  It collapses small enough and is not too heavy. Also, my daughter loves the color."
"I was give my first Jerson First Class hair dryer over 10 years ago.  As soon as I realized it didn't have much life left, I purchased another.  This one is working just as well and perhaps it will also last 10 years.  As long as the company makes this model, that is the only brand I will ever buy."
"We visit my brother in another state for several weeks at a time and we keep items there so we do not need to lug them back and forth when traveling there. We wanted to have a spare hair dryer there, as when our large family gets together there are often items in short supply. This hair dryer fit the bill. IT IS RATHER LARGE. But it does fold up and the cord does retract. Despite its size, it still fits the bin that we use to keep our stuff there. It is fairly powerful and does a very decent job of drying your hair. The only con I can find is that the back end where there is a mesh screen or dust collector, does NOT appear to be removable, so as dust bills up, it will be a bit awkward to clean."
"For years, I've used Conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer (yes, my wife has long hair) and our travel needs (motorcycle touring means limited luggage space). The dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying. Its wattage draw is low enough that tripping circuit breakers is never an issue. Durability is good - our's usually last at least five years with daily use by two people. The current iteration of this model uses a shorter cord and a bulkier plug/GFI than earlier models. While I prefer the original configuration (longer cord with smaller plug/GFI), the changes have not seriously compromised the product."
"Gentle on my hair. Quicker to dry my extraordinarily thick hair!  Compact and convenient.  I have 3 grown daughters who upon visiting have asked where I got it.  Guess what? Three more happy customers!  All three have varied thickness of hair too.  One is extremely think, one average thickness, one very thick and mine as stated extraordinarily thick. Love this hairdryer!"
"Small, easy to mount.  Does the job"
"This product drys your hair quickly,therefore causing less damage. It is about as loud as any other average hair dryer and the attachments are great for straightening and styling your hair."
The best hair dryer I have used in 15 years. My hair is thick and unruly. Humidity makes it impossible to do anything but this hair dryer has helped tremendously.
"So far I love this hairdryer! I've only had it for a few months, but it replaced my old Conair hairdryer that I had for over 10 years. It's fairly quiet, which is kind-of a big deal, and it works really quickly. Plus, its like this soft matte finish, and it doesn't slip out of my hands. I'm hoping it lasts as long as my last hairdryer!"
It is very powerful and also smaller than my old hair dryer and so handles very well for my small hands.  It's always ready at a second's notice.
"I have a lot of hair. It's waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.<br /><br />The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image's pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It's not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn't slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I'm used to, but it's not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don't swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn't an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don't need a very long cord.<br /><br />I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It's just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.<br /><br />As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I'm in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you're probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.<br /><br />Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that's thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn't as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning. I'm impressed with the Prime shipping speed with this one.highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in.

My old one broke down after only about 20 years of hard work. I got a new one and was pleased to find the design was the same. Why get off a winner. Works well and easy to pack.
Best hair dryer I've ever owned. I have long thick hair and I can dry and style it in half the time my old dryer took!
"It has all of the settings (hot, warm & cold) plus the settings are on a slide as opposed to the toggle settings. You don't have to worry about  accidentally changing temperatures or turning drier off in the middle of styling you hair. I also like the retracting cord, it makes storing so much easier."
This is the best blow dryer I ever purchased. I have very thick long hair. With this dryer it dried in no time
"I have had my dryer for over a year now and have had no problems with it. It works as well now as it did when I received it. It is not too noisy and it is light weight enough for me (I hate a heavy dryer). It is a full size dryer , not a travel size, and it dries my hair quickly.  I like that it has 2 blow settings and 3 heat settings.  It is easy to change settings while drying.  I use it everyday....so it has had a real workout.."
"I bought this for my wife when her old one started making a hideous shrieking noise. She is happy with it so far. It doesn't get stupid hot so it doesn't damage her hair. That is important to her. She has never mentioned it feeling heavy so IT'S NOT. Trust me, this 94lb woman asks for help lifting a gallon of milk, so really you should be fine.    I don't know about the ION aspect, I mean it blows hot, dry air. Even the box it came in didn't sound too convinced, using phrases like ions may be emitted, which could possibly make hair shinier. Whatever, it does the job, and doesn't wake the dead."
I have two portable hair dryers with foldable handles.......one I keep in the bathroom at home and one in the roll-aboard.  I like this little dryer for every day use.  It's strong enough to do the job on short hair and doesn't take up much space.
Birthday present for the wife after she used one at a hotel. Drys in half the time and stores easily.
i love my hair dryer. my hair does dry in less time.
bought this for an elderly neighbor who does not do very<br />much outside her home<br />she replaced her broken down model with it<br />so I was happy to help her out<br />much appreciated
"I purchased this dryer for my wife. She loves how quickly it works and leaves her hair feeling soft, and not static-free. It was a pre-Christmas gift, and here in Michigan the air is pretty dry this time of year, so I am officially impressed. There must be something to the whole ionic ceramic tourmaline thing.<br /><br />One of the minuscule clear rubber pieces in the handle dropped off when she took this dryer out of the box. It's not a critical component, but I hope it's not an indication of the dryers build quality and expected longevity. Given how the much less expensive, shortly lived, noisy, less effective dryers she has had in the past have been, I'm not too concerned though."
I have had this hair dryer for a week and I love it! I can dry my hair in under 10mins. The attachment allows you to put the dryer on your hair which speeds up the drying time. I have thin but long hair and I'm amazed at how quickly it dries my hair.
"I love this little hair dryer. I have arthritis and the larger dryers are hard to manipulate. I also have short, thin hair so this little dryer makes it easier to use a roll brush at the same time. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with thicker hair as the heat is not as strong or powerful as an 1875 but it's great for me."
I've always wanted a small hair dryer for traveling.  I actually use this everyday. Great buy and I would purchase again.
"I love the hair dryer.  It's small enough, not heavy or cumbersome so that it wont aggravate my carpal tunnel syndrome."
"I've had this for well over a year so far and it has worked well.  It is sturdy and a little heavier than some, but not bad.  No complaints."
"I initially bought this for a vacation. Within a few days it would only blow cool air. Contacted Amazon who had Helen of Troy email me. They replaced it no questions asked and I didn't even have to send the new defective one back! But let me tell you this I LOVE! I use it every time I shower, not just for travel. It's smaller, but not on power, dries fast and the intake hasn't collected any dust like other dryers do. Has a few different power settings. along with the cool setting and I would recommend this in a heartbeat."
After 8 years this dryer finally became brittle and began chipping near the fan so it was time for a new one.  I had no reservations  buying this same make & model..matter of fact I bought two this time....one will stay in the luggage ready to hit the road.
"I've always been skeptical about new, amazing, breakthrough technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!<br />My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I've had others compliment my hair as well.  I'm giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.<br />  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it's a fire hazard and I'm not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I've actually had people ask me if I've ever tried a really good conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!<br />  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!"
"I replaced my 13-year old Conair hair dryer with this one.  I love it!  The efficiency cuts my dry time probably in half.  The dryer is HEAVY, but it is not a problem for me.  I would also be careful of the retractable cord - it can fly all over the place and hit you or something else.  I have had the dryer for several months now, and so far no problems mechanically.  I'm hoping it will last as long as my last one!"
super sleek looking.<br />works great!<br />cold air gives out cold air n hot gives out hot. if you know what i mean. not like those hair dryers that give warm air when you want cold.<br /><br />good investment
"I bought this dryer for travel but  I am using it regularly at home.  It's good weight although it's not lighter than my 'regular' dryer.  I had hoped for a little less weight but I like it anyway.  I also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer.  Although not essential, it was good to find something besides black...why are colors so hard to find?  This is definitely a 'thumbs up&#34; product."
"I really like this dryer.  This dryer really gets the job done, not only does it dry your hair but it straightens my natural locks"
"Although this hair blower is small in size, it actually dries hair quite quickly.  Small size makes putting it out of sight after using really easy.  Love the Andis hair products"
Great blow dryer. It does the trick and dries your hair quickly. I like the little 'Cold Shot' button as well.
"For the last couple of months I have researched and read reviews of every hair dryer imaginable on every website imaginable and finally settled on this hair dryer.  And I couldn't be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?  I love this hair dryer and I would give it 10 stars!"
"I hate most blow dryers.  They're either not hot enough or too expensive or they feel like they are blowing a soft spring breeze through my hair.  This one is perfect.  I have naturally wavy hair and blow it straight almost every day.  Either I'm loosing my mind or else this blow dryer really does make my hair feel softer.  Dries fast, too. Highly recommend."
"I have wavy hair and had pretty much given up trying to get it straight on a regular basis  When I use this dryer it not only gets straight, but stays that way for the day.  Now I can at least approximate the look I have coming out of a salon - love it!"
"I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  I was a bit leery after reading a few reviews where customers had a hard time contacting the seller or getting satisfaction after receiving defective items but I took a leap of faith since the complaints were few and ordered my dryer.  It came four days early!  Although it came in two separate boxes, installation was a snap even with the minimal directions that were included.  There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  This dryer gets very hot which I love.  I had to lower the thermostat after a few minutes.  The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy but so far I haven't had any problems.  My sister, who has locs, was impressed.  This dryer completely dried her hair in about 30 minutes and she usually has to sit for more than an hour to ensure that her hair is thoroughly dry."
"It blows... it blows hot air... its uses that hot air to dry your hair. I dont have much hair, but what I do have gets dried. Seriously I dont know what else to say. If i was a woman with a ton of hair then I'd say invest in a better hair dryer. This one seems &#34;sufficient&#34; but thats it."
"I purchased this a few months ago and LOVE IT!  I can't claim that it drastically cut down my drying time (I towel dried pretty thoroughly in the past), but it's a great size and absorbs well.  I can put my hair up after my shower and it actually stays put!  It was money well spent."
"There are four thickmaned, long haired females in our household and this hair dryer has been fantastic in tackling drying and styling! It's also surprisingly quiet which is a bonus for early (5am) hair-prep. When our other hairdryer goes up in smoke, I'm going to get a additional Conair."
Bought this as a present for my wife this Christmas. She has used it many times since and absolutely loves it. She says it has cut her dry time in half!
"I had this blowdryer for 2+ years when it blew out and had to be replaced (totally my fault by the way, didnt realize you are suppose to clean out the back of blowdryers. fuzz had gotten in my filter and the motor blew). When I went to buy a new one, I wanted to replace with same model because I loved it so much. It dries my long thick hair much quicker than other models and I do think it is better on your hair (so they advertise, and I so like to think!) The cord keeper is a great feature too and keeps corn from getting all weird and twisted. Get this! Your hair will thank you!"
"My better half is a professional stylist so this dryer gets heavy use. This is her third in about 8 years. Given that it,probably runs 20 hours a week I'd say that's high praise. Fast shipping too."
"I got this for my daughter, who has really frizzy/wavy hair. She's tried several brands of flat irons, including the expensive ones. She says she really loves this one, and it's her favorite. She says it straightens her hair considerably faster than the others, and stays straighter longer. If you could see her hair, you'd know this is no small feat. I highly recommend it."
"I really like this hair dryer!  I have long, fine hair that tangles easily so I use the low setting.  The high heat really isnt that hot but seems to dry my hair quickly.  The size and weight feels good in my hand.  I love the cold shot!  this is the first dryer that I have owned where cold shot means cold and not just air temp.  It sets my steam rollers in a second which again saves me time!"
"Oh the power.  Oh the fast dry.  Oh the beauty of my hair when it is dry after 5 minutes!!!  I have extremely thick hair, and it typically takes 12-15 minutes to dry completely using a hair dryer.  My hair was dry and NOT frizzy after 5 minutes!  WHAT??!!  This dryer is very powerful, and high heat setting is enough to dry the hair but not make it smoking hot.  There is a reason this is rated as Amazon's #1 best selling hair dryer."
"I have had this item for a while, but waited before posting a review. I have had no problems with it at all. It is not super noisy and dries my hair rather quickly. Some people complain of the weight, and while it is not the lighest hair dryer around, it does not wear out my arms when using it."
"Not much to write about, its a hair dryer, and it works.<br />It has different heat settings and cool attachments."
I purchased as a back up for the last one I bought.  I shuts of when it gets to hot.
"Simple, just enough power, and all those ions are exactly what I was looking for.  The color is a plus."
"I had been using an awful 8 year old, non-ionized dryer until I purchased this one... and I cannot say enough good about this product.  The temperature and output controls are fantastic;  it was definitely worth the money."
This is my second hair blower of the exact same model. (Conair Ionic Conditioning Pro Style 1875-Watt Hair Dryer)[[ASIN:B00005O0MZ Conair Ionic Conditioning Pro Style 1875-Watt Hair Dryer]]  I would by it again.
"This hair dryer has a lot of power.  The wall mount keeps it out of the way, but readily accessible when needed.  This is a replacement hair dryer for us and we purchased the same one when the other quit working."
The only reason why I bought this blow dryer was that my other hair dryer gave out on me and due highly to the reviews.  The positive reviews were right on with the product.  I would highly recommend this product to the 3 settings for your hair and the add-on.
This hair dryer is not very big which is just fine with me. I am a short person with small hands so it fits comfortably in my hand and it is also light weight.  Vivid dark pink with 2 attachments that I use a lot. The auto cord reel is genius!!! A bonus.
"Great dryer. It dried my hair in under 10 min. And I have thick hair that reaches my bum. Powerful, my leave your hair a little frizzed."
This is small enough to take on the road and is also small enough to keep at home.  The power is very good.
"I absolutely love this blow dryer. It works so well, and gets the job done in half the time. I highly recommend this blow dryer, I use it in the salon, and it gets my clients in and out in half the time."
This is my second T3 dryer.  I have super duper thick hair and I can blow my hair in 1/2 of the time of any other hair dryer.  It's fabulous!
"Loved this.  Big enough for the rollers and I have long, thick hair.  Hot enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time."
"I bought this because it was cheap and I needed a hair dryer. It works really well and I will probably buy a 'back up' since I expect it will go 'belly up' before too long. It it only last another 6 months, I'll consider it money very well spent."
"This is the second Andis hair dryer that I have purchased because I like it so much. When we remodeled our bathroom, this is the hairdryer that came to mind. I like the night light feature. It is very bright and GREEN! The dryer has plenty of power and has an adjustable heat setting. Can't go wrong with this product. Our first one is at least 20 years old and we are now using it in a different bathroom."
"My curly hair, somewhat thick, used to take at least 30 min to dry (sectioning off and drying with a round brush). After that it would take me another 15 min to straighten and smooth it to get frizz out. This dryer dries my hair STRAIGHT without having to section it off. I don't even have to flat iron it afterwards!!!  It is smooth, straight, and frizz-less in under 10 min!  Amazing!  Will NEVER buy any other dryer!!"
"I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the brand name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2' longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance."
"Wall mounted hair dryers in hotels are so convenient.  I had tried to find one to buy in regular stores but never found one.  Looked online and selected this one because the ad said this Andis was quiet. It really is much quieter than all other hand helds I've used. I have very thick hair, and this dryer does the job easily. Happy to recommend this dryer."
I'm glad to buy this dryer. It's powerful enough to dry long hair in a few minutes.
I always bought this particular model at Wal Mart.  Wal Mart no longer carries this dryer.  This dryer lasts much longer then any other hair dryer I have used.  That is why I keep buying the Vidal Sassoon Ion dryer.
"Just what I wanted/needed...  I read the other reviews to make my decision,  they were right on,,,  Thank you"
"I love this dryer!  It is so much more powerful than the one that it replaced.  It doesn't cause my hair to frizz and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  It is somewhat heavy, but this is to be expected with the extra power that it provides and I really don't have a problem with the weight.  I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I've always held all other hairdryers.  If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used."
"excellent dryer! very powerful, love it so much.  Arrived earlier than expected, and works like a salon dryer.  Im so relieved because I had gotten previous dryers that were so weak and kept my hair wet.  This one dries my thick hair in less than 10 minutes"
"I finally broke down and purchased a new blow dryer after mine started sparking.. really pleased with the purchase! I've now had this for several months and no issues with the surface peeling off, which I was worried about from other reviews."
"I purchased two of the hairdryers on Aug 12th, and today is Sept. 13th so they are only one month old.  I have been careful to sort of break in the first one by using low power for a minute before going to high power and then to switch to low power when I am finished before turning off.  I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves.  It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.  Nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dish washers, AC units etc.  However, so far, I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.  Hopefully that will stay the same for months ahead."
This is the best dryer EVER!  I would never owe any other brand.  Drys my very thick curly head of hair in less than 10 mins.
"Read the other positive reviews and decided to purchase this model.<br />Have not been disappointed.<br />Works as promised and although no hair dryer is truly &#34;quiet&#34;, this one comes close.<br />Highly recommend!"
"Can't believe how small and yet powerful this little thing is!  Best travel hairdryer ever thanks to the ultra compact size and low wattage.  Will be perfect for our trip to Europe.  Wife used it a few times to see how it worked and she is &#34;blown away&#34; (excuse the bad pun).  It really is all you could want in a travel sized hair dryer and you won't believe how small it is, but don't let that scare you away!"
"My Ginga loves this hair dryer and won't use anything else she has long red hair that took a while to dry with other hairdryers. Not this one though, we just recently got into an argument over the amount of crap she packs and the hairdryer is one of them. Happy wife is a happy life though and I have to admit it does cut down on the amount of time it takes to get ready!!!"
"My first Jerdon hair dryer lasted 10 years and we used it every day.  I bought another brand, and it lasted less than a year.  I just purchased another Jerdon Hair Dryer and I see why I bought it in the first place.  It is a terrific hair dryer!  I will buy no other."
"On my second try here.  Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time.  If this one doesn't last longer, there won't be a third."
"I've only used this for a couple of weeks, but so far has met my expectations.  Just installed a new handicapped shower, mounted this just outside the shower above a GFI receptacle.  it does a great job both drying me off, and drying the many shelves in the shower which hold water. My soap now stays dry and firm, and my bath mat doesn't get waterlogged.<br />Best feature - The magnet which holds the dryer in the cradle. Most plastic latches fail after a few months, but the magnet should be bulletproof. I also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower. If one doesn't have a &#34;backer board&#34; I recommend &#34;Molly&#34; anchors to mount the dryer metal bracket."
I really like the hair dryer. The cool switch is great. In other hair dryer I had to hold down the cold button. Does its Job.
I was surprised to see how fast this dryer was shipped. I was looking for a small hand held drier due to haveing RA in both wrists I have a very hard time useing a bigger hand drier. This drier was the perfect size for me.
"I'm happy with the Infiniti by Conair 223XR dryer and its features. Retractable cord, 1875 watts, different settings for cold/warm/hot temperature and also low/high air speed setting. I like the fact that it already comes with both a concentrator and diffuser. It doesn't take long to dry my long hair (up to 70% faster than previous ones) and no frizz effect! I think the cord is long enough and there is a red mark to indicate when to stop pulling. The dryer has a nice design and color. I've been using this dryer for few months and I highly recommend it."
I have a few of these for different rooms. Works well and cord retractor makes cleaning easy.
"This dryer is smaller and lighter than I had expected.  I can travel with it easily, saving myself the hassle of getting a smaller, less functional travel dryer.  It also dries your hair in 5 minutes flat and does all the other great things other people have mentioned."
"Small and powerful.  It dries my hair as fast as my full-sized dryer and doesn't take up nearly as much space.  Also, my hair (which is prone to fuzziness when blown dry) doesn't come out fuzzy."
I ordered my hair dryer for one day shipping;I received have used it and give it 5 stars... it works fine..no issues..I have small hands and this is lightweight enough it doesnt tire my hands... took like 5 minutes to dry my hair and it is thick and holds water... for $20 this is perfect!
This Conair Pro is one of the few hair dryers that still uses a squirrel cage blower fan. This type of fan puts out a lot more air than the prop style for the same noise level. This is a Pro quality dryer with a heavy duty motor so it weighs a little more than a regular unit. It does the job fast.
I absolutely love this hair dryer. With long thick hair I'd gotten used to spending 15-20 minutes just drying my hair enough to allow me to style it. This dryer is not only lightweight and quieter than any dryer I've ever had but it also dries my hair in 5-6 min. That's from dripping just out of the shower wet to nearly bone dry in less than half the time. I don't even need to use the highest heat settings so my frizz is much more contained. With myself and two thick haired daughters using it a fast dryer is a must. So excited to finally have found something that actually is a good as it claims to be.
"I was definitely skeptical of paying this much for a hair dryer, especially one with a brand that I have never even heard of making hair dryers.  But the reviews were good so I decided I'd give it a try. I had really high expectations and they were definitely met! I LOVE this hair dryer. I have wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it, it gets really frizzy, this blow dryer gets rid of at least 75% of that friziness, if not more. And the diffuser it comes with is amazing! Another plus, is that it is soooo much quieter than any other blow dryer I've ever had!!"
"I read the reviews on this product from other customers before I purchased this dryer.  I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer! I have owned several hairdryers over the years and have even been known to burn up a few...  This dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz-free in under 3 minutes.  I use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer.  It is quiet and doesn't get too hot.  I love the adjustable heat and speed settings.  I also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air.  I was unable to find this product at any local retailers (Walmart and Target are the two I checked) and i think it is better than the Conair Infinity X pro model.  If you need a dryer that gets your hair dry quickly and with minimal frizz, this is the one for you."
Love it!  Definitely a salon-style dryer; so much faster on my thick hair than conventional dryers.
"I have thick and very long hair, and I have used so many different hair dryers in my life. But, none of the past hair dryers compare to this wonderful and efficient hair dryer. Now, I can blow dry my hair in half the time than before I had this hair dryer. I hope this hair dryer is never discontinued!"
"I purchased this product after reading all the reviews, and it did not disappoint.  I love it because it dries nicely, it's not too noisy to operate plus it has a retractable cord.  I would say it's well worth the price I bought it from Amazon compared to other blow dryers!!"
"I have a lot of hair and have owned a lot of hairdryers in my life.  I would have never guessed that owning a professional hair dryer could make such a difference. This thing is amazing.  It's works so much faster than any other dryer I have ever owned.  I originally started thinking about paying the big bucks for a pro dryer after reading an article on Jezebel. I had this thing on my wish list for a few months, not quite sure I wanted to spend so much for hairdryer.  I ended up buying it for myself as a birthday present -- what a great decision.<br /><br />If you have long, thick, coarse or difficult to manage hair, seriously consider stepping up to a professional dryer."
"I originally purchased this model to take on a trip to Ireland since my luggage space was limited and the Infiniti was lightweight and compact. It quickly became my go-to hairdryer and I now use it everyday. I have short hair and find the lower setting is sufficient to dry my hair without over drying it. Because it is so lightweight I was initially concerned that it might not hold up to daily use but 2 1/2 years later, the hair dryer is still going strong. Because I travel frequently I ordered a second dryer to keep in my traveling bag."
"Great lightweight hair dryer with 2 speeds, worked well in Italy.  Might be difficult to change to US current, but I will keep it for the next trip overseas."
Great product quiet like I've never experienced I forget it's on if I walk away from it! Lol<br />Gets really hot so be careful to adjust or sit low ..best dryer ever and I've owned 7
I'm a professional and have used this dryer daily for years. Mine recently died so bought another one. Reasonable price too.
"I have really thick hair and this blow dryer dried my hair in no time. I probably will not use the diffuser but I use the concentrator nozzle. Overall, this is a great hair dryer for the price."
"I like it so I can  fit it in a small draw in the bathroom, if it didn't fold I couldn't put it in draw."
I like this dryer. It works well and I like the night light as well. It works well for a small bathroom.
"i been using this face wash for last 3 years now and all i can say is this face wash does wonders, it cleared away all my acne, all my scars that were left by the acne, and made my skin way softer, of course this wasnt only because the face wash, i had to put on facial lotion as well for the acne to really go away but this face wash does what it does and not heavy on your skin compare to many other acne facial wash i tried"
Exactly what I expected
"The hair dryer is tiny, yet powerful. It has two speeds and and attachment to extend the dryer. Build quality appears to be similar to big brand name hair dryers."
"This hair dryer is everything I hoped it would be.  It is simple to use and does the job.  I have my hair professionally colored and highlighted.  I have used blow dryers, hot curling irons and hot rollers for many years but the curl and body I get from hair rollers and this dryer is way better and stays curly longer.  My hair actually feels like it did when I was younger.  My only complaint is the dryer came with a broken clip that holds one wheel (of the stand) on and no instruction booklet for use.  I would like to have these things, if possible."
"I have long, thick, wavy hair that usually takes anywhere from 30 to 40  minutes to blow dry.....with this blow dryer it was cut to 15 minutes!  Besides the time issue most blow dryers drive me crazy because they are  so loud, not this one ..it's much quiter than the average blow dryer.  I had seen this a few other places at varying prices- all way more than  the $40 I paid at Amazon. The only draw back is that it's a little more  heavy than other blow dryers.....but I figure that's good for my arms!  A great purchase!"
"I bought a Tescom hair dryer almost 10 years ago from a Japanese chain that is locally owned where I live, very similar to this one except without the extra styling attachment. That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends. I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush."
"Wife wanted good hair dryer.  I know nothing about them.  I poked around on the internet and read lots of reviews.  People were very positive about this brand and version.  It is a professional grade high quality dryer and she loves it.  She was not familiar with the brand previously.  The only thing to consider (and not a big deal) is that the power cord is longer than a typical home cord as it seems to true that this is used by professionals.  Not a big deal, but so you know it does not have a little curled up cord."
"I was apprehensive about buying this because it was more expensive then what I usually buy, but it's well worth it. Dries my hair very fast without a lot of high heat. We got this mainly for my husband because he has dreads and this was recommended to dry the dreads out completely and now both of us use it."
"I had purchased one of these hairdryers previously and, after a few years it died and I needed to replace it.  It's a powerful little device.  I specifically wanted on that I could mount to the bathroom cabinet for ease of use.  I would definitely recommend this product...good product and good value."
"Not much can be said about a product that is pretty perfect in every respect. I have been using this toothbrush for almost two years now and cannot imagine ever going back to hand brushing. There is such a marked difference between this and hand-brushing that you can literally feel. My teeth have never felt cleaner and my gums have never been healthier. While I used to have pretty bad dental hygiene habits (I used to brush only about two times a day) this toothbrush has helped me improve me regimen tremendously. The results have been nothing short of miraculous. <br /> <br />I take this toothbrush everywhere I can and the charge tends to last several days before recharging is needed. At any rate, I suppose the only shortcoming of this toothbrush lies in the problems encountered when traveling a lot: The base station is simply too bulky to conveniently pack away and take with you. While this is not an issue on shorter trips, travelling in excess of a week will make you scramble for an alternative travel toothbrush. If this toothbrush came with a smaller travel charger, it would indeed be absolutely perfect."
"This is the hair dryer I have been looking for.  I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  I tried this one that my daughter had,  and bought the same one.  I have very short, straight, thinning hair. This dryer does not frizz my already fragile hair.  It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &#34;ionic&#34;.<br />  My only complaint is that the concentrator does not swivel, causing me to twist my hand while holding it, instead of moving the concentrator into a different position.<br />  Other than that, I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  Bonus - A GREAT price for a GREAT dryer.  Much less expensive than others and does just what I wanted it to do!"
"I love this product. This is truly an excellent thing to have for anyone who blow dries their hair.  I hate holding my arms above my head for prolonged periods and found this by searching for a product to hold my hair dryer. My one complaint is that the lever that snaps closed when you attach the suction cup...it snapped in half on the second time of use. It seems the shape of the lever makes it weak in the middle - poor design on that part of it. I am still able to attach it however by using a washcloth to hold the jagged edge when clamping the lever down. Other than that, the product is nice looking and functionally excellent."
"THIS DRYER IS THE BEST I've used for my very curly hair. I DRY MY HAIR SECTION AT A TIME BY HOLDING THE DRYER CLOSE TO THE SCALP, AND SQUISHING THE HAIR INTO THE DIFFUSER. AFTER ABOUT 6 minutes my hair is completely dry. THEN I MASSAGE MY SCALP BUT I NEVER PUT MY HANDS THROUGH THE ENDS. IT IS CALLED THE PIXIE METHOD OF DRYING. I NEVER HAVE A BAD HAIR DAY ANYMORE."
"Like it. Simple, with strong wind power that could dry my hair in a short time, and the price is terrific!"
Takes up very little space.  Has a nightlight.  Very powerful.
"I have fine hair but A LOT of it and normally takes me over an hour to blow dry my hair.  My hairstylist uses this on my hair and it cuts the drying time in half, so I purchased one to use at home. I don't know what I would do without it!"
"Powerful little dryer, and I love the small size, it fits well in my tiny bathroom."
Oozes quality. Easy to maneuver to any direction. Relatively quiet and extra long cord. i really have been spoiled by it!
"This is a good dryer while it lasts. Quiet, good heat, not too heavy. But I have owned it less than six months and yesterday it stopped producing heat, just blew cold air."
"I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews, however, this blow dryer is AMAZING!  I have VERY thick, course, wavy, shoulder length hair.  With traditional Conair blow-dryers from Walmart, I would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy.  I thought that was how all blow dryers would affect my hair.  Wrong.  With this dryer, it now takes me 3-4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen.  I almost cried the first time I used it.  Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  When this one dies, I'm most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!"
This is about the 4th hair dryer I have had that hangs on the wall. I won't have any other style. It makes using the dryer so convenient. You don't have to take it out of the drawer. The little cord hook is very nice.The night light is an additional bonus.
"Love this hairdryer.  Not only does it dry my hair quickly, but the three heat settings mean that I don't have to rely on the hottest setting.  And, if you have fine hair,  it does not create static like some other hair dryers can do in cold weather."
"Yes, it's almost a full size hair dryer BUT it does fold and the cord retracts.  More importantly it's Powerful ... More than other so called travel hair dryers with the same wattage 1875!  AND the cold shot doesn't slow down to the point of almost being off, like other travel hair dryers!!! Annoying.  But not on this one.  Of course I'd prefer a lighter dryer with the same features but until then this one fits the bill.  I'd rather lug something a little heavy that's going to get me out the door FAST and enjoying my vacation!  At this price, I'll be perfectly happy if it only lasts me thru my upcoming 10 day vacation.  Good price."
I love this in that it dries my hair fast. Hood needs to be deeper - but does the trick.  My hair is short - could be hard for someone with long hair.
gave this as a gift & she loved it... it made her drying time half of what it was & she has long thick hair! thanks!
I have extremely thick hair. It typically takes 30 minutes to dry it all. I have been able to dry my hair within 5-10 minutes with this dryer. The concentrator helps reduce frizz from my frizzy hair and makes it easier to straighten. I have yet to use the diffuser but it's amazing overall!!
"I have been using this Remington hair dryer for several years now. I think the one I am currently using is my 3rd, and this recent purchase is my backup for when the current one runs its course.  I am particular in wanting a hair dryer with oomph. I like hairdryers with big bursts of hair - basically that are loud and fast.  I grow impatient with many other models.  This one fits the bill just right.  I also like the look and feel."
This is a neat little hair dryer that has alot of power and does not take up much space. I really like it.
These little dryers are just great in my room and the guest room. Small enough to be out of the way but plenty of power to dry my thick hair.<br />My guests love them
I had my last one of these for about 8-10 years. It finally went kaput.  My 19 year old had been sharing it - yeah that is a lot of blow drying.  This one is exactly the same and I hope to get another 8-10 years out of it.
"I have used my Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord for at least three times a week since I got it, but it has been only about a month since it arrived!  That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.  The ionizer feature appears to really help make the hair easier to manage, too!"
I have used the Elchim Professional 2001 for several years.  My son's girlfriend needed a hair dryer and tried mine.  She was amazed as to how quickly the Elcim dried her long thick hair.  She had to have this hair dryer for Christmas and is loving the ease of use.
It is tiny little thing. Pretty much doll size but blows stronger than my normal hair dryer. Definitely recommend it.
This dry works very well for drying ladies hair.  It is small but powerful.  Highly recommend for travel use.
"I bought this hair dryer a few months ago to replace my old one (a different brand). This new hair dryer is as powerful as my last one (which I loved), but much quieter and my hair does not feel frizzy afterwards. My only complaint is that the handle is peeling a little at the bottom."
I was unable to find a comparable product at the local big box stores.<br /><br />I was pleased to find this at a price that was approximately 50% less than other retailers and websites.<br /><br />Works great and does not take up additional counter top in bathroom.
I really like this hairdryer. I haven't had it very long. But it's working well for me.
"I have wanted a T3 Hair Dryer for several years after watching presentations on infomercials.  My hands don't function well and holding a blow dryer up to dry my short but difficult to dry hair has been a challenge for years.  I finally decided to shop around and get myself one.  I am very happy with the diffusers and how quickly my hair dries using the dryer, however I would like it if it folded for travel.  That doesn't detract from my enjoyment and less pain in my hands having this new product to use."
"My Revlon hair dryer started sparking and died in January, a few days after the one-year warranty expired (yay! not.) so I needed to find a quick replacement. I've been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn't make my arm feel like it's going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it's pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.<br /><br />It's not too loud, and it's definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it's called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I'm not sure if that's force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it's not quite as secure as it could be. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!"
"This dryer works great, not too heavy. Dries well. You could do worse for twice the price (and I have.)"
This is the best hair dryer I have had so far.  It dries great and doesn't make weird noises or show sparks or do any of the weird scary thing some of my others have.
I've used this dryer for over a year now and I think it works really well. I don't find any difference between this dryer and normal dryer but it blow dries  my hair really quickly and has options for cold and hot air.
"Works well , used for a whole 2 hours to dry some stuff."
"There was nothing that I really didn't like about it.<br />And these are the things that I liked:<br />Firstly, it's cheap. Secondly, it's small and not so heavy. Thirdly, I've had it for 5 months now and it's still blowing hot air."
"this is a super blow dry I ever see,<br />its fast and strong,save a lot of time to dry my client hair<br />I wish they could made this blow dry a featherweight in the fulture<br />thanks"
"I have a coworker who whenever she comes in with blown straight hair, it looks like she got it professionally done. I was looking to upgrade my blow dryer, and this was her recommendation.<br /><br />At first I was skeptical because it's kind of expensive, but then I bit the bullet and got it. I LOVE it.<br /><br />I have very curly, fine hair, and a lot of it, prone to frizz. It used to take me close to an hour and a half to blow dry my hair, then smooth over it with a flat iron.<br /><br />This blower dryer cuts my total hair-doing time in half! And I just touch up with a straightener on low heat (around my face, the top/back of my head). I use one of the concentrator attachments that comes with it (I believe the middle one).<br /><br />Also, I didn't touch up with a straightener for a few days, and my blow out really lasted!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone with hard-to-manage hair who wants a sleek and bouncy blow out."
Can't complain about the quality of this product.  It's very much appreciated around here.  Everyone is using it to dry their hair.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has been using it to dry her hair ever since.  She really likes the hello kitty theme and it functions well.
"This hairdryer does what it says it does.  Dries my hair fast leaving it smooth and shiny, quieter than my last dryer, and styles my hair well.  I like the different heat settings because I use it to dry my dog and she needs a low heat blow dry.  I would recommend it."
Always go for the Hot Tools as the professionals use this product and they last a long time.
"I was looking for a hair dryer that was cheaper, but made well. This has fit the bill. I'm a guy and decided I could manage my hair a few ways with a hairdryer, if I chose. I didn't want to burn my hair out or have something too feminine or fancy sitting in my bathroom closet. This is simple and sleek. It sounds like a hair dryer."
This is the third unit I've purchased.  They last two or three years.  It is very convenient and has a nightlight.
I have really long hair but this dryer dries my hair very quickly..it also makes my hair a lot smoother! I would definitely recommend to others for its price and quality.
"I have had a yellow bird blow dryer since 1976. I replaced mine 7/2011 (35 years).  So you can see this powerful, durable, and efficient dryer is worth it's money and more.  I think I spent $15.00 on it back in '76 and that averages out to be $.43 cents per year for my investment.  No wonder it is hard (or non-existent) to find in beauty stores, online, and on Conair's website (it is not available on their website).    I love all of the settings from cold to very hot.  It comes with a comb (I don't use it anymore since I have dreadlocks) and a muzzle that narrows at the tip.      I would also recommend this model to any beauty salon because it holds up."
"I bought the dryer to dry my pets after washing them. It works well, dries quickly, has the ceramic heating element and and ion drying feature as the more expensive models. Durabilty is another variable that I can't access."
"This is like no other dryer I've ever owned.  My 5 year old dryer caught fire . After a few quick looks around my rural<br />town for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers. Right?), and coming up empty,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button & forgot about it.  When it arrived and I used it , it was a force!  My hair dryed  practically instantly and with added volume.  It has many buttons.  Not sure what all are for.  Can't read them without my glasses.<br />Just pushed them all until I get fastest & hotest.  I can use my round brush & this dryer and dry & style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers. Just a few minutes. ( I have shortish hair)  I've got the &#34;Instyler&#34; $100+  & The Pefecter Fusion Styler $100+  & others.  I can't pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed.... (  I think it was $20 or $30.)....  but it does.  Do yourself a big favor & look no further.  It's no gamble at all. With Amazon you can return it."
This blow dryer did everything they said it would do. My hair looks like I stepped out of the salon with that salon finish everyday! It is shiny like they said it would be and it is not damaging to my hair at all. This is a great blow dryer for someone to use in their home once or twice a day but I would not recommend this blowdryer for salon use because it does start to feel a little heavy after a few minutes so I couldent see a stylist holding this dryer for 8 hrs a day which is unfortunate cause it is a GREAT dryer!!
"I searched all over town for a hair dryer like this one before checking Amazon.  I had one of those universal combs and none of dryers would fit it and it is so hard to find dryers with comb attachments that won't break in my thick hair.  This dryer not only fits the universal comb, but it comes with its own comb which works just as well.  It gets pretty hot, so it doesn't take that long to dry my hair.  I would definitely recommend this dryer."
"I've only used this once, so I don't know if it was a fluke or my imagination, but my hair does seem particularly nice and soft today.<br /><br />I have long hair and did not experience my hair getting stuck in the fan, although I know that can happen with any dryer. I don't see why this dryer would be any worse than others.<br /><br />It IS stronger than my old dryer but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic. I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa. I've never had a cool temp before so I tried it, who knows, maybe that is why my hair feels especially nice.<br /><br />It's definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer but it did seem that my hair dried quicker so I think it's an OK trade-off. Also my old dryer's motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don't find much difference in loudness or tone.<br /><br />I like the rocker controls. The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders. With this new dryer I can easily change a setting and I find it easy to keep my fingers slightly to the side of the controls to avoid accidentally making changes."
"I bought this dryer for 3 reasons,: 1. My dryer is about to pass on 2. I have arthritis in my shoulder & wanted a lighter weight one & 3. Based on the reviews here I purchased this dryer. I wasn't planning on paying a ton for a dryer, my daughter's a professional & I don't see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear & tear!<br />I have fairly long, course, thick hair, that has always taken FOREVER to dry. Well, my hair was dry in half the time & it is lighter than my other dryer, so it didnt kill my shoulder & irritate my arthritis. It has a nice defusser, nice & small, not long like others so you can actually hold it away from your hair & not burn your hair or scalp. I am very pleased so far & will look for other hair care products by this company. I definetly would recommend it!!"
"Lots of settings, strong air flow, there's not much to dislike about this. The nozzle (?) is a bit long, making it slightly unwieldy, but other than that it's fantastic."
"I love this hairdryer. I ordered it for college and it works great. It's not only small but it also packs a big punch. It warms up quickly and gets the job done. I go home and I hate using my mother's hairdryer because mine is so much better than her expensive, bulky one."
"I just really like this hairdryer.  In fact, I purchased this item to replace the exact same hairdryer, which I had for probably about five years before it finally fizzled out.  It's comfortable to hold, it dries my long, thick hair quickly (no easy feat), and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  I initially replaced my old hairdryer with a different (more expensive) ionic hairdryer, and didn't get the same results.  So I looked for an exact replacement on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find it, not to mention at such a good price.  Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to click the &#34;Buy now with 1-Click&#34; button, and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Tourmaline Ceramic technology - emits infrared heat and negative ions, which makes it gentler on hair and faster drying<br />Lightweight, comfortable to hold and use<br />Long cord<br />Foldable - packs and stores easily and compactly<br /><br />CONS:<br />Doesn't have separate heat and speed settings<br />The on/off switch is a little difficult to use<br />Doesn't have a retractable cord"
"This hairdryer Is similar to a blue Vidal Sassoon hairdryer (that I wrote a review about a few years ago) that seem to Not be available any more which Is easy to repair. This hairdryer Is 3 speed so the wiring Is more complicated than In the Vidal Sassoon. I have taken this hairdryer apart to clean and lubricate It, I take the back part off which has a metal screen Inside run In under the faucet with hot Water then I spray WD-40 In the motor doing that It will probably last forever. It has of get to burn out the fuse which I have bypassed a few times on the Vidal Sassoon but apparently there seems to be a piece  of plastic under to button to the switch which I lost taking It apart I put It back together and It worked right but had to use a small screw driver to turn In on and off with so I tried to modify It so that I did Not have to use a small screw driver now only high setting works. I have taken other hairdryers apart and could Not hardly put them back together this hairdryer goes back together fairly easy but It being 3 speed If You break some wires I do Not even want to think about It. I use hairdryers for many things as thawing out Water lines, defrosting the Freezer, defrosting the windshield on My Truck, pre heating the cab, dry out socks and shoes, putting under blanks when Its very cold this hairdryer has a round back which helps keep stuff from blocking off the Air flow and I have had hairdryers to burn out because of having a flat back and fall In to a chair with a blanket and burn out, and this hairdryer has a good automatic heat switch which prevents It from over heating but do Not ever leave a hairdryer under the blanket while You are sleeping or Not there."
"My first expensive hair dryer. It really does dry faster, leaves my hair in better shape, and is amazingly quiet."
"My hairdresser recommended this dryer, I love it it drys fast and if I use a round brush, my hair comes out straight hardly have to use my flat Iron."
"I have thick and course hair.  I think this dryer does a great job, especially for the price.  It is heavy as the other reviews state.  I was using a travel hair dryer prior to this, so the weight definitely took some getting used to.  It drys my hair about as quickly as any dryer can.  I would recommend this product."
Absolutely love. Im a male african american and i have very course hair. With a round brush it gets my hair straight without needing a flat iron. It even dries my hair completely with cold air! My conair never was able to do that. Simply amazed with it. It id definitely worth the price.
"I have long curly hair and I was convinced this wouldn't work. I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan. Needless to say, only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan, but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess. So I wanted to try this - especially now that winter is coming. I really don't want to leave my house with wet hair. It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy. Its like the heat locks my hair product  [Paul Mitchell's Hair Curling Lotion] in place. I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container. I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer and it even dries my hair on the lower settings. My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it's pretty huge. Right now, it's in the dining room. Other than that, it was worth every penny. Would buy it again."
"Love this little hair dryer! It's small, but definitely powerful enough."
"This dryer definitely lives up to its claims.  As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  I use this for my daughter's hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  This dryer also provides moisture and helps with the manageability of her hair. I strongly recommend this product."
"I've been using it about two weeks now without any problems.  It blows a strong current of hot hair.  It takes up very little space because it is very tiny.  But being tiny doesn't mean it can't do the same job of a bigger dryer, because it sure does."
"Small, compact, powerful!"
"I have had these for sooo long without any regret (except for blowing my hair out)...  Small, compact, quality product.  How often do you hear that about a small hair dryer?  Great product and for the price..."
"We tried other brands after the first T3 died, but they never matched how well the T3 performed. My wife explicitly asked for another T3, got it, and she loves it."
"Terrific dryer with all the attachments and features one would ever need. Can be used by a professional, has it all. Does not disappoint!"
"I bought one for myself.  My mom used it and was amazed.  So I got her one also.  It really makes a difference.  I dye my hair a lot, and this dryer doesn't make my hair look like hay. Edit...looks like it barely lasted 3 years. Seems short to me...I've had dryers last a lot longer."
"There is no way not to recommend this product. Since the first time I used I felt the difference in my hair: it's softer and brighter. Sometimes with other conditioners, hair tends to fell, but you won't feel this with SOS Reparacion."
"I first discovered this well-functioning hair blower at a hotel where I was staying.  The lightweight, sleek design hair styler seemed to have a higher heat output at a lower wattage than any models I had owned.  I purchased one from Amazon when I returned home and as usual, received my items in record time.  The hair styler is a pleasure to use and I especially like the heat options and focus of air (without attachments) that allows me to get the job done efficiently."
"I replaced my old one with this dryer. My daughter has one like it and I love the amount of air produced. I have long, thick hair and drying it is a snap with this dryer."
This is a new kind of dryer for me. It has an ionizer in it or something similar to that. When the hair dryer is on there is an orange glow coming from the nozzle. I have very thick hair and it takes me forever to dry it. This hair dryer cut that time down significantly. I would definitely recommend it
The 2000 watts gives it the blowing power needed as well as generous air intake that doesn't stifle it's power.  The heating element is placed far enough back so the hair doesn't get burnt.  Tough - I've dropped mine several times and it's still up 40 blow dries a week. This one has been in daily service for a year and probably won't break on it's own ... leave that up to me - my favorite dryer for the past 12 years.
"As a bald man, I love this hair dryer. It helps my wife dry her hair in a fair amount of time, less than her previous hair dryer. Seems to work pretty good. Typically loud when on, so I leave the room. Also, of note, this hair dryer does not have an actual turbo despite the product description. I feel like this is either false advertising and I have been duped, or the seller has no idea what the hell a turbo actually is. Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like &#34;strong wind&#34;, they should have used a word like Kyf, which is Japanese for &#34;strong wind&#34;. Or maybe the German word for &#34;hair dryer&#34;, which is fhn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, &#34;quiet fan and motor&#34; is subjective. It is loud. And I have not tested the &#34;lifeline shock protection&#34;. I would hope it works, but after the other misleading information, your results may vary."
"Thought I was the only weirdo that struggled to dry her hair w/in 45mins.<br /><br />Recently found out my best friend is the same & she (like me) was convinced there was no way around it.  Writing this review b/c there's probably more of us out there.  And you 100% aren't stuck.<br /><br />I've got long, thin hair - but a lot of it.  It traps moisture & it's naturally wavy, so it always took me 30-45mins to tame it dry.  Most of the time, a solid 45mins.  Result was hit or miss.  Since I have to wash my hair every other day, breaking point comes when you don't want to wash your hair b/c you don't want to deal with the drying time & tired arms (...and I'm strong).<br /><br />Bought this on a whim during a Gilt Group sale, when my generic (probably Conair) dryer was on the out.<br /><br />Now I dry my hair in 10-15mins.  Usually, a bankable 10mins.  On a bad hair day, 15mins.<br /><br />No, seriously.<br /><br />On top of that pile of awesome, it's very light & evenly weighted.  Buttons are intuitive & don't get accidently knocked on/off while you use it.  Results are always the same.  Doesn't damage my hair w. heat (probably b/c it takes so little time).  And it's small enough that it's an easy travel companion.<br /><br />Don't get scared off by this dryer's price - it's a life saver.  And game changer.  Delay getting this if you want to waste your time.<br /><br />For the Holy Trifecta: this hairdryer, a boar bristle roller brush, & Shu Uemura White Tea Polishing Milk.<br /><br />This dryer & a boar bristle brush easily tames my hair w. little effort & leaves it looking silky smooth.  Every time.  (Note: choose a brush that has both natural boar bristles & taller plastic bristles w. the knob-like, non-scratchy tip - needs a decent amount of boar bristles, but few enough to let air through easily. It doesn't have to be expensive, just needs to fit those parameters.)  For doubled ease, get Shu's White Tea Polishing Milk.  A little goes a long way.  You'll be a happyaddict.  Rub some in your hands & pat it from middle of your hair to the ends, but particularly the ends to give them a little tangle protection.  It helps smooth my hair even faster & it lets my hair better tackle humidity - friends have commented that I look normal when they feel they don't.  PS - The brush & Shu isn't a hack - the dryer is.  The 3 together is trifecta.<br /><br />I was ecstatic to find this - I'd always struggled just to tame my stubborn hair.  Now I actually feel in control of it.  Just bought a replacement for my 3/4yr old original & also bought one for my mom as an xmas present. My friend's now a convert & begging for the name of my dryer.<br /><br />You won't regret."
no clue about the bad reviews...this dryer gets my hair good and dry. And it dries really fast too! Its a keeper!
"This hair dryer hangs in the wall in the bathroom so you have more room in your drawers. It works well, but needs to be replaced every few years after daily use. It is powerful enough for my family, but if you have thick or long hair with a lot of girls in your family this hair dryer might not be powerful enough for you."
"My sister bought this hair dryer a few years ago for $200.  One weekend I spent with her, she let me use it.  We both have super thick hair which takes time to dry (about 30 minutes with a regular hair dryer).  Most time, I go out with my hair still wet because I don't like to take the time to dry it, plus I get overheated.  Well, this dryer worked in half the time (or maybe less).  I don't go out with wet hair anymore because it dries so quickly.  It's light and works great, and now the cost is less than 1/2 what my sister paid.  Totally worth the investment!"
"I was in need of a new hair dryer after mine broke and I discovered that they don't make it anymore. I purchased a hairdryer at a local beauty supply chain, thinking that it would work about as well as my dearly departed one. Wrong! It left my hair feeling very dry, in spite of the product I use on my hair prior to blowing it dry. I was going to invest in a CHI, but after reading mostly negative reviews on that model, I decided to save my money and get this Andis hair dryer. I have very thick, coarse, long hair (4 inches past my shoulders), and I'm transitioning from relaxer to natural. I have about 3-4 inches of new growth, and the rest is still relaxed, so straighter styles work for the time being. This hair dryer is EVERYTHING! Not only was it easy on the wallet, it gets my hair dry super quickly, while not sucking all of the moisture out of my hair. It takes less than 20 minutes to dry my hair, which is quicker than even my original blow dryer, and gets my roots pretty straight (I use the small tooth comb attachment). It's easy to hold and gets hot without burning my scalp. Coupled with my Sedu flat iron, my hair is almost salon quality, super soft and shiny! I would recommend this to anyone with the same hair texture as me. I am VERY pleased!"
This hair dryer has been amazing. I have very curly hair that is sensitive to heat and I found that this hair dryer does not dry my hair out. I am a sceptic at heart and have been disappointed by many dryers but I have to confess than after a few months of use it has improved my hair. I do find that my curls are less frizzy and do not tend to dry out as much thoughtout the day. I have never found drying my hair an enjoyable experience until now. This dryer is not cheap but not the most expensive either and well worth the price. I will be buying the flat iron in the future!
"I love this hair dryer!! I have long, thick  hair, and it only takes about 10 min to dry it!!! I used to spend about 25 min just drying my hair and another 15 min styling it. I've reduced that time to just 15 min. What's not to like?"
"Super powerful, blows a lot of air.  I had a much more expensive hairdryer that was almost double the price for the past 6 years before this one and this one is even more powerful than my old one.  I need a strong hairdryer b/c I have very thick hair.  Just to give you an idea, wall mounted hair dryers at hotels are totally useless to me.  If I plan to dry my hair while traveling, I have to bring one.  This one comes with a bunch of different attachments.  And I like the animal print (although my husband does not but that print was much cheaper for some reason than the solid color ones)"
My dream hair dryer....great product.  This hair dryer dries my hair quickly and gives me the smoothness that I want.  I enjoy using this hair dryer because it gets the job done in less time.  My hair is thick and it takes forever to dry but not with the Andis 82005 Professional 1875 Watt Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer!!
"I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment. It clicks in no problem (as well as the concentrator but I've only used it once) and you can easily take it off. The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom, it helps. It also has a hook on the base of the handle, you can kind of see it in the picture, which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up. I use it on the hot heat, low setting and I don't see a lot of frizz even without product. It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy. But if you use it on the high setting, it gets noisy. Overall, I love this dryer. So far. I'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer."
"I first saw this a couple months ago - my new hairdresser was using it. It was very quiet, despite the Ferrari engine printed on the side! I commented and they were selling them there: $260 for a $400 hairdryer.  Seemed like a deal, but a lot for a hairdryer, so I went online and found it here for $162.  It's powerful but gentle, I don't smell hair burning like with cheaper hairdryers.  The only possible negative you should know is that it's a little heavy, heavier than I'm used to with the $20 cheapo ones from Marshalls, anyway!  But I don't care - I love it."
"This hair dryer is larger than I expected as reviews led me to believe that it was small and light, but it works very well on both low, medium and high heat and is satisfactory."
"Lots of blow, lots of heat, and it is a light weight!  I have a bad shoulder and this thing is easy to use.  We even bought a second one."
My last blow dryer was a Remington and it lasted for well over 10 years. That is the reason I purchased this one. I looked at cheaper ones but kept coming back to this when it arrived I was not disappointed. It had all the features I wanted plus it feels sturdy in my hand not fragile like one drop and it's over. Also it drys quickly  and isn't terribly noisy.  If this one lasts half as long as my last one I will be a very pleased customer. Like I said I love it.
"I bought this hair dryer at Target several years ago, and was SOOO impressed with the power, that I would randomly talk to people about my new hair dryer!!  I had long hair at the time, and it cut drying time down significantly.  Also left my waivy hair perfectly straight and silky smooth.<br /><br />I do think after a few years, the Ion starts to lose effectiveness (on all hair dryers I've ever had).  I had it for at least 4 years, before the back filter broke, and then my hair started getting sucked into the back.<br /><br />So I tried several different dryers, even expensive name brand ones like Babyliss, none that I really LOVED like this one.  I recently chopped my hair off, and am using a less powerful dryer.  But after realizing my love for this dryer, I went ahead and bought a second one, and have it put up in my closet, to use again once my hair grows back out, and I need that 'power' to straighten and dry quickly<br /><br />Only CON is that is IS a bit heavy... after having no luck with lighter ones, I realize the weight is worth it."
"Overall I am very happy with this product.  My old blowdryer was awkward to work with and weak, and I would only blow dry my hair for special occasions.  Now I blow dry my hair every time it's washed.  My blow-dry time has been cut in half with this blow dryer.  It's much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  It has a long, sturdy power cord, which makes the dryer easier to maneuver around to dry and style your hair.  It comes with a nozzle but not a diffuser, so if you use a diffuser you'll need to purchase one separately."
"Finally a blow dryer that leaves my hair frizz free. I've tried Babyliss pro cermaix (not impressed!) and other drug store blow dryers with the ion feature. I have frizzy, thick, coarse hair and a LOT of it. Before blow drying I put garnier leave in, chi silk infusion, and a heat protectant in my hair. My hair is left smooth and for once NOT poofy and frizzy. I love it! BUT I don't think this cuts out on my dry that much."
My second one. Love it but only hope it lasts a lot longer than the first one I bought. First one slowly died. Started to shut off sooner and sooner during dryings. Took it apart and found that the fan was rubbing on the housing inside and wore and cracked the fan. Became unbalanced inside and the fan speed slowed down causing it to overheat and shut down constantly.  If I could have bought a new fan blade I could have fixed it.
"We have had walll mount hair dryers in our bathroom for over 20 years.  They work great and last a long time.  The new Andis meets my expectations for power and convenience, takes up very little space and is always easily stored.  Every family needs one!<br /><br />3/30/3013  I wish to change my review after using this product!  I bought 2 of these dryers in Sept 2011.  One was replaced under warranty after 6 months.  Both of them have now quit (one was used for 18 months, the other for 1 year).  In both cases the dryer was being used at low speed when it sudddenly smelled hot and switched to high speed.  The low speed switch apparently burned out.  I am not sure they are really safe to use after the burn smell.  I also do not like the high speed for drying my hair!  My previous wall mount dryers (both a different brand) lasted over 10 years each.  I feel this product quality is not good considering the short life of the product.  These dryers were used only about twice a week.  My dryers in the past were used daily and by a large family, so these Andis ones definitely did not last well."
Bought this for wife and sisters-in-law to use when visiting.  They love it and the retractable cord keeps down the mess.  Comes with each to attach and remove diffuser and concentrator attachments.
"It's expensive, but worth every penny, it seems. Has an extra long cord. I don't know what all the fancy technological issues are but when my wife says I love it it gets five stars. The cheap hair dryers we used to buy would work for a few months then die - this one seems to be made to last for years."
"Very good for the price. It used to take me 30 minutes to dry my hair, its very long and thick - now it only takes 15 minutes or less and there is a cool setting, so i can finish up with that to bring the temp of the hair back down and lock in the style."
"I was sick of buying cheaper dryers and having them break after a year, so I decided to spend more on something professional. This hair dryer is quieter than any other I've used and dries my hair in half the time! It is definitely worth the money.<br /><br />UPDATE: It is now 3 and a half years since my initial review and I am still extremely pleased with this hair dryer... It was definitely worth the investment!"
I would definitely buy this again. I had an older model for years that we traveled with and it finally wore out.
"Product arrived on schedule.  Have looked for several years for a decent, reasonably<br />priced hairdryer which is lightweight with several heat settings, and not too loud!<br />The decibel level was always the deal breaker.  Not with this Revlon hairdryer.  Very<br />pleased!!"
"Used it in southern France. Directions very clear about how to switch the voltage. Still needs the plug adapter, but I knew that when I bought it. Folds up nicely, Very powerful for such a small dryer."
"I love this hair dryer! I've had it about 2 months so far. It's main benefit is it dries my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer. I also seem to have less frizzies. It is a little heavy, but I got used to that really quickly. Several different heat and intensity settings also, which I like alot. It's not too loud either."
"I was very skeptical of spending so much on a hair dryer.  After reading the great reviews, I figured I would give it a try and hope for the best. I was so eager to try it this morning that I didn't even let my hair partially air dry like I normally do!!  I have never timed how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo ionic dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn't hit well enough with the dryer.  My husband even commented that my hair looked pretty today (I didn't tell him I bought a new dryer!!!!)"
"I have been searching high and low for a moisturizer that won't leave me feeling like a greased up pig. I have tried several, including a myriad of non-greasy moisturizers. So far, nothing has worked as advertised. My dermatologist recommended this. Miraculously, this actually absorbs within minutes, and does not leave a greasy feeling at all. Of course, there is a trade-off. If you have very dry skin, you will have to use this 3-4 times a day to really be effective. Less, if your dryness isn't that bad. It has no smell, and won't aggravate acne. Really tho, the only thing I care about is how fast it absorbs. As long as I use it regularly, it keeps my skin nicely moisturized. I definitely recommend this to anyone who also needs a non-greasy moisturizer."
This has the power I like to use to get my hair dry fast. It's also got the low settings for really setting a curl or straightening hair. This has some force to the blow dry.
"I have thick African American hair.  This straightens my hair quickly and I don't need to work SO hard when flat ironing my air with this.<br /><br />I also suggest buying a nice ionic hairbrush like the CONAIR and if you use flat irons, you can find a really good IONIC brand without spending Chi money.  I have the Titanium Tools Jilbere de Paris flat iron.... whatever it is... works for me and cost me around $50. Half the Chi price.  Get the Biosilk or the Chi silk Infusion (use a small amount) to protect your hair... they last a long time and protect your hair.<br /><br />You will rarely need a salon with these ingredients."
"I honestly do not know where this has been my entire life.  I have very thick and wavy hair, this dryer styles my hair in half the time.  I usually would blow dry my hair, put a frizz control then use the flat iron.  With this my hair is healthier, I don't have to use my flat iron as much and I use very little anti-frizz product now. I would reccomend this to anyone who has thick, wavy, or even curly hair and wants to be able to quickly style their hair. I've tried everything thing I could think of to get my hair to straighten easily and efficently and this is the one.  In 32 years, I've never been more in love with any of my hair tools."
For the money you can't beat it. Plus it comes with attachments!! I would definitely buy this if you are looking for a new blow dryer and not interested in spending too much money.
"Love this dryer! I have very thick, unmanageable hair but with this bad boy it goes from super frizzed out to soft and shiny. It's not heavy at all and I haven't had any problems with it overheating or shorting out (sounds like operator errors to me). Definitely worth the money and the wait."
"Bought this dryer to help with my dense wavy hair frizzing when I blow dried it. This seem to do the job well. It has lots of options for heat and speed, and gets my hair dry faster than my old &#34;cheapy&#34; dryer. I have noticed less frizzing and my hair is smoother and shiner than before. I would give it good marks for value for money, it appears to do the job as well as more expensive ceramic dryers I looked at."
"I was actually looking for something else when I stumbled upon this and thought &#34;why not&#34;.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn't attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I'm not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is). I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too."
"Hard to find a small, lightweight travel dryer that we use everyday. Works great and very portable when we travel in our RV. Would buy again."
it's a little heavy but it's well made and easy to use.<br />I like the smooth feeling of the surface.<br />wish it was a little bit smaller/lighter.
"This hair dryer really dose make your hair softer, I have had it a month now and I use it only if I have wet hair before bed or going out and it only takes about 5 min to dry my hair (my older one took 30) I highly recimend it."
I know others have poo-pooed this product because you have to use water for it's application. I purchased this product along with some of it's rivals. Hands down this product was better...for the following reasons:   1) It was less messy to apply because only the part of the stick that is wet will apply color to your hair.   2) It dried quickly and didn't rub off of my hair onto my clothes and fingers easily.     I really enjoyed this product and I will purchase more of it.
"I used the 'soft touch' black version of this hair dryer at a high-end resort hotel once and I was immediately in love, so I had to get this (white) one on Amazon. It had so much power for such a small dryer!! Highly recommended."
"My 12 yr old daughter has long, very thick hair and her arms get tired when she blow dries it. This allows her to read, enjoy a snack and blow dry her hair all at once.  It isn't as fast as a hand held dryer but if she's reading, the longer the better. It has air holes all over the inside and works great for her thick hair.  The ends of her hair that stick out of the bottom take a little longer but it's worth it.  I'm thinking of trying it out... It was a little difficult trying to find a place to set it and a chair that was just the right height. She just keeps it set up all the time and it's become a permanent fixture in her room. Definitely worth it."
"Read all reviews and still bought this dryer, I think some people expect to much from a product so far this dryer is doing what I expected it to do. The retractable cord is working and the handle folds like it should and provides proper heat and cooling."
Dries my long hair really quickly. Very lightweight. I like that it has several settings so I have choices on strength and heat level.
"This is typical hair drier I saw all the time at my fitness center, nothing fancy but a work horse, it works fine, and it's reliable, that's all I was looking for."
Works as expected fast delivery
Bought this as a gift for my mother to replace her old blow dryer. Should last her years to come.
"Replaced an old model with this.  It is faster, quieter, and lighter than it's predacessor.  Price the same as in stores,"
"I've been using henna hair dye for a few months now.  My hair feels so much healthier than when I used regular hair dye.  It's a bit messy using it, but you adjust and I am pleased with the final outcome!"
"[[ASIN:B0009XH6V4 Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer]]My 10 year old granddaughter never used a hair dryer until she received this one from me as a gift. Now she uses her dryer every night. I wanted her to have a small but powerful dryer, and it is. I will be ordering one for myself today."
"Holy cow...maybe it's because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago and I haven't blow dried since (what can I say?  It's hot and I'm too lazy to fancy up in the summer) but WOW this thing works fast.  It's cute, it's small, but it packs a punch!"
"What I love about this is that it is fairly quiet, and yet seems to dry my hair quickly.  I especially like the concentrator, as it has a small opening and really works as I'm shaping my hair.  My hair is wavy, and I try to straighten it as I shape the style.  Using my round brush, the concentrator focuses on each section and dries it straight."
"This is the 2nd time I bought this little hair dryer because I like it so much. My first one finally bit the dust after about 3 years. It's very small and lightweight--a plus for the suitcase, but still powerful enough to blow dry my hair fast. I have short hair, and this sweet little dryer is all I need to dry and style my hair--no need for a comb or brush. It's no frills--only 2 speeds--high and low. But it does exactly what I need it to, and it does it fast!"
"This is the first electric equipment I bought from Amazon, and it is ALL beyond my expectation. I highly recommend it. If you want to buy a non-professional hair blower with professional effect, you should try this. The only thing not perfect is that the plug is a little hard to fit, but it's okay."
The hairdryer was working well but suddenly started making a really loud noise after a few months use. The seller was really helpful and sent out a new one which is working well.
We had one previously that last for years!  Glad that we found the same to replace it.  Hope this lasts as long as the last one.  Works fgreat!
Very powerful for such a small blow dryer.
I love this hair dryer. I like the settings so I have options for how much heat I put on my hair. I also like the cold shot button so I can dry my hair without heat. I like the attachments with give me styling options and the metallic design is really sleek.
Dries really fast. I have to use a brush and brush my hair while using this dryer or else it is just an odd mess. I live in area with high humidity off the Gulf coast and my hair stays flat all day! Even straighter than my straight haired friends. I do have to use another dryer when I want to wear my curls because this dryer takes them out.
Love this hair dryer.  It takes less time for me to dry my hair. I would highly recommend this product to any one looking for an above average hair dryer
"Ok Here goes. I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances. My two daughters with hair down to their but dry their hair in my wife & I's master bedroom bath. They get up in the morning about 1.5 hours before we do, to go to school. For years the last hour of our sleep was inturupted and we might as well have gotten up with them. This dryer makes 70% less noise & drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity & heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace & quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes. With the other dryers, twenty plus minutes each to dry my girls hair now twenty minutes maybe total. I love this dryer and I only used it once."
This blow dryer lives up to its claims.  Dries hair fast tames frizzies and gives my fine and thin hair volume.  I like that it folds and it is very light weight.  I am a little worried as to the warranty because their website states only certain authorized dealers are covered.  Amazon is not one of them.  I trust that Amazon will stand behind this sale as they always do.
"I don't like a large, heavy hairdryer so I wanted a small one that I could also use for travel.  Works just fine."
"Its a little heavy but works great, the heat settings work well and I believe this will last a long time as compared to the discount ones that don't last long."
worked just like it is supposed to really like the dryer got the job done in half the time of my old blower. Will recommend this to anyone.
"We have been looking for this style of hair dryer for some time.  A similar but different brand dryer from local store was disappointing; loud, strong vibration, poorly made.  We have been very pleased with the well made Andis dryer after several weeks of use.  It is quiet, vibration free, well made with a long cord."
"This is the way to get a professional quality hair dryer at a fraction of the cost.  There are three or four brands selling essentially the same dryer including this one but none have the cord length of this one.<br /><br />Its performance is exactly as hoped and more.<br /><br />The cord is incredibly long, making plug concerns a thing of the past.<br /><br />We bought our second one recently."
This hair dryer is great..Leaves my hair so shiny after it is dried. Just the right size.
"I don't blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn't gotten a good solid workout like ones I've used in the past.  That being said, I do like this hairdryer.  It is easy to travel with and doesn't weigh a ton - can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  The retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now.  Worked very well when I first received it. Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.) If you want separate air flow and heat settings, this isn't the dryer for you."
"Dries fast and leaves my hair shiny and straight. Its a little loud, but it puts out a lot of air so I guess that is to be expected."
"I use to buy the department store regular hair dryers and my hair was never as smooth as I want, I had to flat iron a lot. This dryer is amazing. Takes all the work out of blow drying. You can see the steam of water as you dry. Be careful it is high heat, but will dry your hair in half the time and you need very little flat ironing."
"I have been using this dryer for the last year and love it! I have thick, long hair, and the high heat settings make drying/straightening my hair super quick. It also doesn't singe/burn hair like other dryers I've used in the past. And as an added bonus, it is lightweight so no tiring morning hair routine. The attachments have also held up well over the last year, though I wish the small attachment was a little more narrow than it is. I'm buying one for my mother today."
"I bought this hair dryer based on a recommendation from Good Housekeeping and other Amazon reviews.  It's powerful, dries and styles my very thick and long hair in a fraction of the time my old hair dryer did.  Only drawback - it's a bit heavy."
"Love this hair dryer.  Everything as described.  Seriously people, hold the plug while you push the button to retract and no one gets hurt!"
I am glad that I purchased this hair dryer. It is quieter than other hair dryers that I have used in the past.
"I was unsure of what to get for my daughter as she has thick hair, this works great for my daughter's thick hair!"
"I love this dryer.  I used a similar one at Planet Hollywood in Vegas and tracked it down when I got home.  I have wavy hair that always frizzes into a puff ball when I use a hairdryer.  I had switched from my old dryer to the Remington Wet2Straight which I thought was the greatest invention ever, but this dryer quickly replaced it.  The key is the high power motor, it gets my entire head dry in less than 10 minutes, with no frizz.  A quick run through with a straightener after I'm done is all I need.  Plus it's lightweight and quiet.  This product saves me at least 15 minutes in the morning that I used to waste getting frustrated with my hair...try it!"
"I spent a lot of time comparing the features and benefits of different hair dryers before buying this one. I have a Babyliss and like it, but wanted to try something new. I didn't see a big difference initially, but when I used this and the Babyliss on alternate days, I was amazed at how quickly the FHI drys my hair. I can exercise in the morning before work because this cuts down the amount of time I need to get ready. It is lightweight and quiet, and I  hope that it lives up to its claim to have a longer life."
"So originally I had purchased a  Andis 75370 Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic 1875 Watt Hair Dryer last year. The dryer was um, well I didn't like it that much. Too make matters worse, the attachment began falling off with the slightest touch. That becomes very annoying since my hair is so thick.... Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.<br /><br />So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far. I wish I could have got the blue one but it cost almost $11 for shipping which made it not worth it. The color is very vibrant. O yea the main thing is, the dryer dries my hair very quickly. The cord moves with you and was a fairly good length. I would recommend this product."
"I have only used the diffuser and low speed setting for this but I love that it sends only cool air so I get the right type of drying power. I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven't noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don't get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I'll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it's that you just push the button, I don't notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It's easy to hold and doesn't slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn't wrap itself up while I'm using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product."
My last one burnt out after 3 years of use. Hope this one will last longer. It works very well especially when 3 people use it daily.
"I used to always buy expensive dryers that ended up not being powerful enough / produced boiling lava hot air that damaged my hair unless I held down the &#34;cool&#34; button almost the entire time.<br />At a hotel, I used this blow dryer and was amazed at how powerful it was. My hair was completely dry in under 10 minutes, and the air was not painfully hot. This fabulous little dryer is also a great size for travel, or simply taking up less space in your bathroom.<br />Ditch the fancy dryers and go for this one. I can't speak to the longevity since I've only had it for a month, but I am confident it will last long enough to fulfill it's mere $20 price tag."
"I've had this dryer for a few months now and it's fantastic. I have loooooong thick frizzy hair and has cut my drying time in half. Comes in a fancy box, looks nice and shiny and does the job. Since it's a professional tool, it has an extra long cord, which i like. It's not super big so i've even packed it in my carry on for vacation (it's not exactly small either, but it was worth to bring it with me and not have to use the little dryer the hotel offers)."
This compact styler is fabulous. It folds up nicely so it takes up very little space. It has traveled throughout Europe and the Mediterranean with us and has never been a disappointment.
First unit shipped had its case broken.  Second unit super and works well.  We had looked for this device for a long time.  We ran our of finding old units at rummage sales etc.
"The hair dryer has a number of settings and will allow you to have very cool air or very hot air.  It is quite powerful and gets my long hair dry in less time than other dryers I have had in the past.  It is a little heavy and I definitely would not refer to it as compact - it's about the same size as a standard dryer you might get at a drug store and it's heavier as well.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it and hope it lasts a very long time."
it doesnt damage the hair like the other dryers ive tried and its very lightweight
Powerful little travel dryer.  I actually used this in England as well as on my US vacations.
I keep my hair high and tight so I'm not drying long hair but it is thick hair. Like a rug you know? It takes 2-3 minutes to dry my hair with this dryer. It has sufficient heat on low for my hair so if you put it on high it's probably overkill. The balance and weight is good as well.  I've always bought Conair brand and my last one would probably still be alive if it hadn't got broken by our movers. For $11 and Amazon's return policy I figured I couldn't go wrong and so far I'm happy with the product. I'd buy it again.
"This blower dryer is the bomb. It dried my hair super fast there are three heat settings and a cool down setting, very 21st centuary.  Shipping was fast too. I love the compact size it's not too big or too small.  And as far as blow dryers go it's not nosy at all. I can finally blow dry my hair with out disturbing the nieghbors."
Did a lot of research on blow dryers and settled on this one based on positive feedback.  Totally worth the money.  Dried my hair and made it a lot straighter than my old dryer and only took half the time!
"I love the compact, lightweight design and 3 different heat settings & cold shot. Great for a small apartment. I've been using this dryer at least once a week for the past 4 months and have had no problems so far. Attachment helps focus the air flow and is a nice addition. Only complaint so far is that the plug is a bit too smooth, so it's hard to handle when I have hair product on my hands."
This is such a great product. It is easy to apply and it does much for my lashes. No more fake lashes for me. Lash extensions does it!!!
"I needed a fast blow dryer that wasn't too expensive or really loud. This one did the trick. I've had it for awhile now and it's really held up. With me and my three teenage daughters using it, that's really saying something."
"If you have short hair, it works well; not sure how it would work with long hair.  Easy to pack for travel"
"And she just loves it.  Not only does she like Hello Kitty, but pink is her &#34;very mostest favoritest color in the whole world&#34; as she puts it."
"I didn't fully appreciate this dryer until I broke it and I was without it for a few days.  It dries fast and gets really hot. Extra help is its long cord. I don't have the frizz like I had before. Watch Carley Babel on YouTube on how to blow out your hair, she is such a help."
I was a hair cutter for ten years back in the 80's.  Nothing has ever beaten the Yellowbird as far as power and design.
"This is a nice dryer for the price.  Seems a bit heavy, but it works for me.  Dries my thick hair thoroughly."
Ingenious product. Simple and convenient. I glued it to my mirror and stayed there. No more trouble holding the dryer on one hand and brushing my hair with the other one! worth every penny
I love to keep my hair looking shinny and healthy and in the winter it gets dull and in the summer it looks fried.  I live in California.  This neat little gaget givese the conveinceof doing a deep condition at home for just the cost of the conditioner and a shower cap instead of paying those heavy prices at the salon. and it onlytakes 15 minutes and I can do it my PJ's instead of getting all dressed up and and over paying a salon for what I can do for a few bucks.
"I don't know much about ionic dryers because I previously had the same hair dryer for over 15 years. I like this one so far. It is sturdy, but I don't consider it heavy. It has enough heat settings in my opinion and also includes a cool setting, similar to a hooded dryer, which I like, my last dryer did not have this."
This hair dryer is much smaller than I expected.  The smaller size makes using the nozzles much easier for those of us that don't have chimpanzee arms!  The machine is also really quiet and efficient.
I have very thick hair that is difficult to dry. This hair dryer is powerful and dries my hair quickly and easily. I love it.
"If it's possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer, this would be the one.  The dryer's best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that I have owned over the past, well let's just say 4 decades.  The other advantages are the multiple heat/cool settings, length of the power cord and the cool shot button.  All controls are arranged conveniently so you don't mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using.  Dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half, the use of anti-frizz and shine boosting products so think of the $ savings there.  Only thing I would change are the lack of detail in the instruction manual, but thanks to this review section it's not really needed.  You won't be disappointed."
"I have long hair so it used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair completely. Now i can get it dry in less than 5 minutes! It's also useful to know that when you have it on the low/medium speed, it's uber quiet. I can blow dry my hair at night without having to worry about waking my family members. Definitely worth the money."
the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat. you can see the difference in stying compared to a traditional hair dryer.
"My only complaint is that the extension does not clip on. Whenever I put the dryer away, the piece falls off and I have to go fishing for it. Other than that, it is light weight and cuts dry time. The highest heat setting is HOT."
this was recommended by my hairdresser and it is all I expected.  It dries my hair!!!  faster and most likely won't konk out in a few years.
My days of buying $20 or less hair dryers from the big box stores are OVER.  I have long thick hair that takes forever to dry.  I have taken to wearing a pony tail far too often because it is such a pain to dry my hair.  I am very sensitive to loud noises and really hate high pitched wails.  Hairdryers always made me cringe and using low speed is not an option for my hair.  I got this home and immediately plugged it in to find it has a lower pitched noise that is absolute music to my ears.  It will not drive me nuts and I will no longer feel like I am waking anyone up in the house using it.  It also cranks out the air and has excellent settings to power through my drying.  Thanks amazon for changing my life through exposure to products that actually work!
"I have very thick, long hair that takes over an hour to dry, I bought this product so I could save some time by working on my laptop while my hair is drying.. I am pleased with it so far. It's very quiet and adjustable. I haven't figured out a way for it to dry the underneath back part of my hair but it honestly takes less than 5 minutes to blow dry after sitting under this for a cycle. The only con, is the storage aspect obviously. It's big but the height can be adjusted to make it a little smaller. It's very portable and durable."
I only use conair blow dryers. This one is smaller than my last one (which was 5+ years old). The barrel is shorter making it easier to pack for a trip.<br /><br />ML
This is the second time I purchased the same exact item. My first one lasted at least 4 years! It works.
No more mess in the kids bathroom. They love it and so do I. No problem with dryer strength. Lots of hair on both.
"I have had a few Conair hair dryers, but this one with the folding handle really saves space in my bag!"
"Quiet and fairly light weight. I have very long hair that usually takes 20+ minutes to blow dry. I use the medium temperature setting and it takes me still close to 20 minutes, but my hair is so soft afterwards that I don't even mind!"
"I finally replaced my old hand-me-down Conair dryer with this John Frieda dryer, and it has been like night and day!<br /><br />The significant differences are:<br /><br />- faster drying - I am pretty busy so I often find myself needing dry hair ASAP (to pick my kid up, to head outside, etc.). I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

Really like the hair blower. makes my hair feel soft and silky..its a little heavy but it dries your hair fast do its no problem
"My wife loved it, it's a big step up from her mothers 1960's, THE HOTS little blue Hair Dryer that has nearly burned down the house at least 3 times already."
"Bought this particular item based on positive reviews from Amazon customers.<br />Gave one to my daughter who thought it was quieter than her old dryer and dried her hair quick.<br />Gave one to my mother who thought it was noisy and a bit heavy, but dried her hair very quick.<br />(My mom is the pickiest person on earth....so take it with a grain of salt).<br />Remington sells matching pink hairbrushes, which makes it really gifty."
"After years of buying those low cost hairdryers that I knew were not helping my thick curly already dry hair, like another reviewer I started researching for the best one I could find and I knew it would be expensive.  Well, this one is absolutely worth every penny.  My hairstylist was using this dryer and it took 1/2 the time to dry my hair.  I love the extra long cord and the various settings.  It was a little heavy at first, compared to my old Vidal Sassoon but I quickly got used to it.  You will not be disappointed.  I'd purchase another one in a heartbeat."
"After purchasing several other dryers, this is the one! My old Conair Baby, that was ancient, bit the dust. The newer versions were a pale comparison, so I started searching. My requirements were: relatively light weight, doesn't sound like a jet engine, larger than usual air blowing surface, long enough cord, a little less than 1800 watts. This is, by far, the nearest thing to my old Conair Baby that I found. I actually went back and ordered another for a spare. I've been using this now for a few months I think, & I love it."
The first one I received was DOA.  No biggie - Amazon had a replacement at my doorstep in a few days!  Small and works well (like most other reviews state).  I'm probably going to order another one at this price just to keep for a back up!
This hair dryer is fantastic!!  I can dry my hair in half the time it used to take me with my old dryer.  I have very thick long hair and it's so annoying to have to dry it but when I do this is the best one I've ever used.
"I am natural with thick thick African American hair.  My hair goal is to get to waist length and don't like flat ironing my hair.  The last time I went to a salon, I came out smelling my hair like it was burned.  So I started looking for a blowdryer that will make my hair straight but not flat ironed.<br /><br />I did research and decided to try this.  God... I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee it.  I just finished blowdrying my hair and it looks just the way I wanted it.  Not too straight with some volume to it.  Ughhh.. Why didn't I buy this a log time ago?<br /><br />NOTE TO SELF: AFTER DOING RESEARCH, READ REVIEWS, QUICKLY BUY PRODUCT..<br /><br />Try this if you want to... you won't be disappointed...<br /><br />XoXo"
I have been using the Blo & Go for nearly two years and love it.  I have been looking for a second one that also can suction to a wall or mirror - and am disappointed this is unavailable at this time.  It's been like that for awhile.  Please start selling these again or tell me where I can get one.  Thanks!
"Very heavy but powerful, it leaves my hair shiny."
"I have very dry hair and this little hairdryer works so quickly, I can already see an improvement.  My hair is less frizzy and much softer and shinier."
I never right reviews but had to say how much I LOOOOVE this blow dryer.  I have really thick hair and this blow dryer cuts my drying time in half.  I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone.    [...]
Gets my hair dry faster than my old dryer.
"I love this blow dryer, I bought it because it's the one that the lady at the salon uses.  It gets really hot fast and it has four heat settings (low-cold, high-cold, low-hot, high-hot).  I use it with a round bristle brush and it staightens my thick curly hair in less than half an hour and leaves lots of volume.  You won't regret buying it."
powerful and small enough to travel with
My mom travels a lot and this small size and ability to change electrical current for overseas a plus....no additional adaptor needed. 1875 watts is quite powerful. All you need for on the go or at home is storage is an issue.
"It's a hairdrier and it works. The true test is how long it will last... and unfortunately, I won't likely come back and review it in a few years."
"This hair dryer dries my fine straight hair very quickly and is rather quiet for a hair dryer. It's a little on the heavy side, so if you have hair that takes a long time to dry, you might want to get a lighter dryer so your arm doesn't get tired."
"I really like this little hair dryer, and it is all that I really need.  I have long hair but it can be totally dry in 5 minutes with this unit!"
"I am very surprised to be writing a raving review about a hair dryer.  I never really gave much thought to my hair dryer and the potential damage it could do to my hair.  My last dryer (it was either a Clairol or Revlon-I threw it out after it starting throwing sparks) left my hair extremely dry after approximately two years' use.  I kept switching shampoos and conditioners, thinking that my hair was just changing and I needed to find a new product.  Turns out all I had to do was buy a new hair dryer!  Before purchasing this dryer, I read a few online articles that suggested a lower wattage dryer for fine hair.  That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now and the difference in the feel of my hair has been unbelievable - extremely soft!  In addition, the dryer is surprisingly quiet and dries my full head of hair in less time than my prior dryer.  Overall, I recommend this product."
"The speed and heat settings are wonderful. I don't get that gross feeling like it is burning my hair, or blowing it insanely, like with other blow driers. It is very convenient for storage."
"I have a hair dryer with higher wattage than this one.  It keeps overheating and switching to cold air.  When it cools down, it goes back to hot.  It takes forever to dry my hair as cold air does nothing.  I was in a hotel that had this hair dryer.  It's lower wattage, but it took less time to dry my hair because it did not overheat.  When I got home from vacation, I decided to see if I could find the same hair dryer on Amazon.  This is exactly the same one as in the hotel.  I ordered it.  I received it quickly.  I LOVE IT.  I love that it's mounted on the wall.  I love everything about this dryer.  Don't let the lower wattage fool you.  This seems as hot as my other dryer.  It must be a little less, because it never overheats, but you wouldn't notice it.  I can dry my hair faster with this dryer."
The only problem with this dryer is that the long metal pole connecting to the hood. The round piece around the metal pole is cracked!!!  Trying to figure out how I can find a better solution then this plastic piece around the metal pole.
"For the price, I don't think you can beat this. It's very similar to professional hair dryers. The diffuser is a little big, but still does the trick. Highly recommended."
I've never had a ceramic hair dryer before and I'm amazed at the quality and functionality of this one.  It provides a consistent heat and air flow.  It is heavier than other dryers I've owned and I was told that it is due to the ceramic.  This dryer is also much quieter than others I've used.  The benefits far outweigh a few ounces of extra weight.
"When it comes to hair dryers, I have to be the weirdest person ever. I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air. I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can't spend the money on a dryer. With that being said, I love this hair dryer! I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I've applied my make up. Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry. Obviously not everyone will have the same results. I have fine hair and it is rather long, it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back. If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time. It really does cut down on my hair drying time. I went from around 15-20 minutes to 3 minutes and 28 seconds.<br /><br />As far as the construction of the actual dryer. Eh. It feels very cheap. I'm curious to see if it will last more than a few months."
"I would defiantly recommend this hair dryer!! It's lightweight, quiet and drys my hair fast without leaving it frizzy! I was hesitant to buy because it was a little on the expensive side but I'm glad I made the purchase."
"I bought this for my lady as one of her Christmas gifts. She had her last hair dryer for 7 years or so. This one drys her hair in half the time and is about 20 times quieter. I can't write much about the features, but I do know that she loves it."
"My hair is so soft with this dryer and it doesnt frizz out.  Also, it isnt as loud as my previous cheaper dryer."
This tiny hair dryer has a lot of power behind it; fits well into the vanity drawer; and easily packed for travel.
This is buy far the best hair dryer ever! I have thick curly hair that usually takes an hour to dry. This hair dryer took less than half the time to get my hair dry
"I purchased this dryer 6 months ago. I have very long and thick hair - it takes me 20 minutes every morning to blow dry my hair. I have not had a problem with this product yet, and I love the folding handle and retractable cord. The retractable cord gets a little hung up at the very end, so I feed it through manually for the last couple of inches. Not a big deal in my opinion."
"The fan speed is stable and fast!<br />3 temperature selection is very useful, neither too cold nor too hot for me with short hair~~<br />Highly reommend!"
"This is a great little dryer. I bought it after using one in a hotel and wanting one for myself. It is very basic but does the job without destroying my eardrums. A minor complaint is that the cord is bit on the short side, but I cope with it."
"I have fine dry frizzy hair, not straight not wavy. I used cheap dryers before and was very skeptical that any expensive dryer can make any difference. But I was wrong, this dryer DOES make a difference. With FHI Heat Nano it takes me just under 5 minutes to dry my hair and as result my hair looks great: it gives volume (with no gels or mousses), remove frizz and make it straight (with no iron).   Highly recommend this product."
"It will seriously dim the lights in your house, but man can it dry hair!"
My Sister got one for Christmas and I borrowed it from her.....fell in love with it! My hair is thick and it dries in less time than my other one.
Works well. I have thin hair and it dries it quickly but I have body!
I love this hair dryer!  It works so well with my thick hair.  I recommend this hair dryer to anyone with thick hair.
"The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo is easy to use, moves a lot of air, and packs just as easily as a folding travel hair dryer. It's extremely well constructed and in comparison to my previous folding travel hair dryer, the quality of everything from the breaker plug to switch in the handle, far exceeds my previous unit. Could be used as a everyday hair dryer and takes up very little space."
"During our last vacation, one of the hotels had this dryer.  I loved how different it was and how my hair looked after using it.  I wrote down the name and model number.  When I came home, I looked it up and bought one.<br /><br />I didn't think one dryer was different from another.  I was wrong.  I use this every day and it doesn't disappoint."
"I don't ask for much from a blow dryer. Compact size and reliability. I had an identical model branded with a different name that lasted me 12 years. After approximately 4,300 uses the mechanical switch broke so I needed a new one. Can't beat the price. BTW, when I disassembled my old one to see if I could fix it I noticed the 120/240 volt &#34;switch&#34; did not seem to be connected to anything."
We had one of these over 18yrs old and it finally gave out!  The new one outdoes the previous model!
This is a very well built little dryer and works well.
Drys my thick hair fast!!
"The removable lint screen makes this dryer a rare find.  I got so tired of trying to clean out my previous dryers, knowing that the air starvation would otherwise cook the insides and cause early failure.  The high air flow is also a plus."
"I love this blow dryer.  It dries my hair, which is very thick in very little time.  High quality, especially compared to the blow dryers you can buy in the local market."
"My wife used one of these at a motel we stayed in. She really wanted one so I bought it.  Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel. You will hate yourself later when you have to disassemble it to dig her hair out of it because she complains about it not blowing hard like it used to. But women are like that.........blah blah blah complain blah blah.....<br />If you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky. I think a nuclear bomb would be easier to work on."
"I bought this to replace another Remington that I'd used for a few years.  So far, I've been really happy with my purchase.  I chose this because of the quality of Remingtons I've had in the past, and this one seems to be just the same as the others.  Quality.  The blow dryer does have a slight rubbery feel.  I've never had one like that.  Can't say I care; it's just different.  Not better or worse.<br /><br />I did choose this one specifically because of the attached diffuser.  Essential for those of us with curly hair, and it works well."
pros: dries my hair quicker that my T3 (that i spent $180)   cons: seems a little heavier than the T3 and the cord is on the short side because it retracts.    Definitely worth it  ... will never spend big money on a hairdryer again ater using this one!!!
This is my third 1875 Watt Hard Hat Hair dryer by Conair Pro Style.  They are well worth the money and last!  I bought this one so it could be sent to my summer vacation rental.
"So I was at a hotel over the weekend and they had one of these hair dryers.  I thought &#34;Wow!  This thing is quiet and powerful!  I need one.&#34;  Mind you, my old dryer was almost 6-7 years old so it was due time.  For the price I was skeptical but holy moly is this thing awesome!  I'm one of those &#34;I hate washing my hair b/c it takes forever to dry&#34; kind of gals and this bad boy had it completely dry in a few minutes.  It's heavier than my last one but who the heck cares because I don't lose hearing after use and I'm done in a few minutes vs 15 with the previous one.  So yeah... Clearly I recommend this. :)"
Well the subject sais it all.  I scored big on this.  I bought it because of the reviews and I hit the jackpot.  My wife spent at least 15 minutes drying her hair each day.  My daughter has reached the age of needing to dry her hair each day so sharing the $20 target special had become a real hassle.<br /><br />The first morning my wife used it she was simply amazed how well it did.  She thought it might be a little hot for my daughter (age 11) but she was not sure.  We just gave her the cheap hair dryer and my wife is using this one.  I assume this will hold up well over time.  If we have any mechanical problems or anything negative develops then I will edit this review and add the updated information.  I give it 2 thumbs up!
"My hair is very thick and coarse and used to take forever to dry.  I inquired to my hairdresser about higher wattage dryers and you would think I asked her how to find the holy grail!  Well, wonder no more -- you can get a honking, high-wattage blow dryer right here on Amazon.  It's a little pricey, but isn't your time worth something?"
"I wasn't sure about spending so much on a hair dryer. I normally just buy the ones at the drug store. This one was recommended to me since my hair is fluffy. It has an extra long cord and a cold shot too. It dries my hair without burning it, and keeps the frizz down without having to use a ton of silicone oil finishing product. I would highly recommend."
It dries so fast it is great! I had brought one over from France that my mom had gotten years and years ago but unfortunately I was never able to get the same power due to the voltage difference. I ordered this one and it is the same to the T (except color). Cut down my hair routine in half.<br />It does fume and heats up A LOT so be careful!<br />(I have black relaxed hair)
"I got the leopard print and it's beautiful!!!<br />this model is a little bit heavier than the Babyliss TT tourmaline titanium (the white one), but it does dry the hair in HALF the time!!! I have long hair around the middle of my back and I dried it completely in 4m25s. With the Babyliss TT it would take about 8-9 minutes. Do this is completely worth it!!!!"
Neat little unit. I have no complaints.
"Prompt delivery, my microwave is back up and running."
Works well with proper preparation.
Got it sooner thank you
Received product as described and expeditiously. A++++
Works well.
Works the way I expected it to work.
fits ikea wall cabinets..
Came in on time. Had no issues
works
Product does the job it was sold to do.
TThe kit works well. It took lots of work to unload and reload the microwave over the range though.
We are back up and running.
Met my needs
Works as advertised!!
I like how it doesn't allow finger prints
"The buttons are hard to push, but otherwise, it's just what I wanted."
Everything as expected. Installed the magnetron and diode by following videos on YouTube and everything is now working again.
As Advertised
it works
Worked perfectly. No issues and fast shipping.
Very simple to operate for my grandmother.
Finally a microwave that doesn't beep!!!<br /><br />Included &#34;Crusty Plate&#34; was badly bent.
2 months & no problems!
Replaced in Sharp Microwave; took about 30 minutes; now turntable works again.
"After two brand-new microwaves which became prematurely aged, paint peeling, dysfunctional I decided this must be a game that I had not grokked. When we looked for a microwave we did not look on the basis of price, being believers, you get what you pay for. This machine, and it is a machine made by man work flawslessly, and has a baked enamel, one piece interior which looks like it will outlast all the microwaves in my future. I will watch and report..two months and counting..."
Small and simple to use. very well made.
Sounds quietly after turning on for one second. It heats well too.
Microwave works well and there have been no problems.
part is same as picture
Works greats.
yup.  works well for a small rental unit.
Looks Good...Works Well
as described
"Works as advertised.  Much cheaper than a service call or a completely new microwave.  Just be sure you know how to confirm the problem so you know which part has failed (search youtube).  An oven that won't heat is often, but not always, a failed magnetron."
"Microwave that takes half of the space of the previous, fits in the corner and don't interfere with wi-fi!<br />Putting the magnetron beneath the microwave made it compact."
It microwaves leftovers and it fits in the corner with a relatively small footprint.  That's all I ask from it.  Wish it came with a low profile plug but I figured out a way to make it work.
This met our requirements for a space saving microwave.  We would recommend it to any one with limited counter space.
We gave this to my daughter for her birthday.  Her husband installed it over their range.  She loves the convenience of both another oven and the option of a microwave. the convection is large enough for a big baked chicken.
"This little microwave fits into the corner.  We have limited counter space and switching to this mircrowave give us back so much room without losing the convenience.  If you cook in your microwave it won't hold a 9x12 baker, so keep that in mind when deciding."
"I have a tiny kitchen and was replacing an over the range microwave. I was looking for a space saver microwave, and I found it. It is large enough to handle anything my old microwave could do like day to day tasks of reheating, baking potatoes, and other small food items."
Just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options. Just getting used to it. Unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet. Didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit. I was kind of wary that it would arrive damaged due to the weight of the item.I would recommend this item.
"I had a rust spot inside my microwave oven.  Sanded it down, put on two coats of paint, fixed the problem and the rust hasn't come back."
"It's rather small on the outside, and just big enough on the inside.  Everyone who comes over thinks it's a TV."
it works
I have had this microwave three years.  The only problem I ever have with it is that the door sticks sometimes.  I just have to tug on it every once in a while.  The oven works consistently and does everything it should.  The defrost stops intermittently to tell you to turn things over or separate them or whatever.  That is sometimes helpful and sometimes not -- If I have just one chicken breast in there to defrost I have to hit the button to resume defrost about three or four times.  I do respond by turning the chicken over one of those times.  I defintely recommend the microwave.
"My daughter had a GE microwave/oven combo. The microwave had the infamous GE flaking paint interior problem. The cost of replacing the integrated units to correct the microwave was very steep. So I bought a can of this paint to see if it would work.<br /><br />To my amazement, it did! Now it wasn't easy, I had to degrease the inside of the oven (TSP), then sand it by hand and some machine for about an hour to get all the base paint solid. I used PaintStriper sanding blocks, 60 and 100 grit, the followed up with some 150 grit paper. Then I had to mask the oven opening with masking tape, paper, and a cheap plastic tarp to beware of overspray.<br /><br />Pro - Followed the directions on the can, and sprayed away! It worked and is still holding up 3 weeks later. So about $35 in material has, so far, stopped a very expensive (hundreds of dollars) oven replacement.<br /><br />Cons - The paint is acetone based so ventilation is a MUST .  Pick a day when doors and windows can be open and I would get the kids out of the house. The paint does dry very fast in about an hour."
"You will be surprised at the amount and size of food this oven will accomodate.  It cooks everything from meatloaf to pound cake evenly and locking in juices.  I bought this because my other Sharp over the range microwave gave up after eleven years of constant use.  I was used to the Sharp features which made it the logical choice.  At the same time, I wanted to replace my conventional oven (also 11 yrs. old) because it never baked evenly.  With the Sharp micro/convection combo, I no longer have to replace my conventional range oven - I'll use it for storage."
Didn't use it long so I can't attest to that but for the price it is extremely good looking and feels like a quality build. Just know it's small - you will not be nuking turkeys in this - and it's not super high wattage so it may take a bit longer. So if you must have your canned soup in 2-1/2 minutes and not 3 then this won't work.
Really love this microwave. Has the one touch settings that I wanted along with the +30 seconds button.  Its a great size for a countertop.  It can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said.
"Excellent small microwave!  I recently moved to an apartment which did not have a built-in microwave, but also a kitchen that wasn't that big.  This microwave was perfect for it.  Its footprint is small, however it packs a punch.  All my plates fit it and cooks everything evenly.  The only downside is that when opening or closing the door, the whole microwave sometimes may move as it's not the heaviest out there, but I'm not going to fault it for that, I just simply put my other hand on top of it while opening/closing."
Love this microwave!  Gives me more space in my kitchen. ..only con is the price.
"Had this for about a week and so far it's been great; the microwaving powder is quite strong; but the grill plate is too high for some bulkier food, that would be my only complain."
"This is a funny story....years ago my husband found one of these cube microwaves at a garage sale for $25.00!  It was perfect for our daughter as she has an extremely SMALL kitchen with very little counter space etc.  Recently I moved to a older home, new home to me with lots of charm and very little counter space. No room for an over the range microwave. My new little Whirlpool Cube fits perfectly into the corner space of my new little kitchen!  Love it, Love it, Love it....however $25.00 would have been an easier price on the pocket book! LOL"
very attractive and useful mircorwave
Although only .5 it holds a nice size dish.  I love that the controls are at the bottom. Counter space is limited so this is peer.  Would be great in a dorm room too
Extremly satisfied
Worked well on an old Sharp Carousel II Microwave. 1 can was enough for 2 coats. First make sure you sand down and prime any rust spots so they won't show through.
Great purchase.  The microwave does the job and was a great price.
excellent results
"Works great, product was as describer and delivered promptly and on time."
Perfect for semi truck at 750 watts can run on1000 watt inverter
Good
What a great unit!  Took some fiddling to install but the unit itself is really very nice.
"I had found a small blue cube micro wave some years ago.  After 16 years of service it finally wore out.  I love the cube shape and took a risk on ordering this little gem.  I couldn't be happier.  It is the great same size, the outside is fabulous and it has more power than the last microwave. Would not hesitate to purchase this again! Totally worth the price."
Love LG products. Got product in a timely manner.
"You can't use the &#34;cook&#34; feature with a timer going on the machine, but it heats quickly and is very easy to clean."
"Lighter than the GE one it replaced.  Easy, simple to use TouchPad.  Installation was easy and I am not the best when it comes to installation of appliances.  I usually pay someone but the previous reviews indicated it was simple and they were right.  You just need 2 people when you are ready to lift it up and hang it in place."
"Install was really easy, and the microwave looks and works great. The buttons are really touch sensitive and it seems to clean very easily."
Just installed it  that part was easy
I couldn't enjoy our travels in our RV if I didn't have my Sharp convection/microwave oven. I just love it !
"Excellent product -- does the job.  I have one in my home, and when an older over-the-stove unit failed in a rental, I immediately ordered another.  A few things are tricky in the install, but were easily and quickly resolved.  Tenants happy, I'm happy.  In this case, the older unit had limited functionality, the Whirlpool has several features new to them that are real benefits."
love it!
"We really like the look of this microwave. We used the same model in our last home and liked it and just had a new home built and chose to have the same model installed in our new kitchen. We have never had any issues with it. It is classy looking, large enough for a casserole dish, and heats well."
Awesome!
Very good item
"I was reluctant to get a microwave because of limited counter space that I have in my tiny apartment, so I talked myself out of not needing a microwave. But then I realize how convenient it is to have one and found this one that's just the right size, that's when I knew I had to get it. But don't let its size fool you...it can fit a full sized dinner plate. Five star for sleek design and function. Love it!"
"The microwave does what it's supposed to do and is easy to use. I like the express settings so when you press any single digit it automatically puts in that amount of minutes. It is great for urban kitchen needs. For smaller kitchens, doesn't take up too much space or for bringing up flights of stairs it is nice and light. Really compact, heats up food well. Great for the price."
What a beautiful micro.  I love it.  Works great.
"Excellent! I love the shape and size, perfect for a small kitchen"
Had not heard of this brand. Was a little unsure about purchasing.  Really nice looking and very quiet!  Great value!
very good
"This is the best, most efficient little microwave we have ever had."
Easily installed it is both attractive and operates easily
This is the perfect size for the space we have and I think it's the only one that will fit! And good quality.
I m happy with it
"Looks great. Works great. I've been using it since May, probably daily, and haven't had any issues at all. It's stainless on the inside as well, so it wipes clean easily. Food and beverages seem to heat evenly. Great deal!"
Love the versatality of this oven!
"We've been very happy with this.  Not sure I liked the dial at first, but being able to dial in extra time is quick and efficient."
Prompt delivery and great looking microwave. I cannot wait to try out grill function. I already went through instruction book to familiarize myself with the functionality.
Great Product
"I only use a microwave to reheat coffee so when I bought my new house and it didn't have a microwave in the kitchen I was kind of like, meh, no biggie. However, after several weekends of cold coffee I caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space. I AM SO FREAKING HAPPY WITH THIS. It's literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want. If you do &#34;cooking&#34; with a microwave, then this isn't your best option. But if you're looking for something to heat up a beverage or reheat something small then this guy is great for you. Have I mentioned how cute it is?!"
It works just fine.
I needed a vertical microwave to fit a special spot in my galley.  This unit has proven to have both the power and interior space to meet all my needs.
Excellent quality. Fixed our $500 microwave. Learned that mfg offer 10 year warranty.
"I was a bit concerned after reading some of the ratings, but I took the plunge -- and I'm glad I did.  It does everything as good or better than advertised.  As with most products, the manual could stand some extra effort (simplification), so those who don't read it do so at their own peril.  Both my wife and I are pleased with this product and hope it lasts as long as my original Samsung (11 years)."
Good
"This has been a great little addition. The plate is as large as a that of a larger microwave, but this fits in smaller space -- in this case, in a corner."
Simple and basic microwave. Works as expected and does the job. Perfect for limited space on a countertop.
Super
"Love this microwave.  It fit perfectly in the area I wanted it to.  I wanted a simple, smaller microwave and this fit the bill.  Most microwaves are larger and have too many bells and whistles for me.  It is very attractive - I wanted some stainless to match my other appliances.  I have another Danby product (dehumidifier) and find Danby to be a good product.  In one review I read it said the microwave slid when opening the door - I haven't found this to be a problem at all.  The price for this is great.  Would definitely recommend it."
"So far so good! It's just big enough to fit my large ikea plates. I didn't think it would be, so I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't want to sacrifice counter space, and this was the best option. It seems to heat up pretty well. Sometimes it takes a little longer than other microwaves, but for me an extra minute isn't a big deal. For the size and price, it's a fantastic buy.<br /><br />EDIT: Just thought I'd update. It's been 2 years and it's still going strong. No issues whatsoever. It works just as well as when I purchased it."
Excellent
We had the olver range model in our house but had leave it when we downsized into an apartment. This is the countertop model of the one we had to leave behind. As the wiseman said<br />I have a happy life when I have a happy wife.
"Great basic little microwave.  It is small, but it has all the basic functions you need.  It heats things very thoroughly and quickly.  Surprised at how much hotter it is than my bigger GE."
"Could not have asked for anything better. The price was so cheap and the microwave works very well.<br /><br />The door is kind of hard to open. When I open it with one hand, I tend to push the machine a little.<br /><br />No issues with heating and seems to work well.<br /><br />The sound is kind of loud..but it is a microwave."
"A little smaller than I anticipated, but still great!! I should've just read the dimensions better"
"Works very well if you properly prepare your old microwave first by degreasing, sanding, cleaning and taping it off before applying multiple light coats."
"matched its description, successfully replaced broken part on my samsung dishwasher. does the job needed, which was mostly just to keep the top dishwasher rack in highest position. i have used lever to raise and lower but it's just not some thing i need often. hard to install, had to really press on it using tools, before it made an audible snapping sound and settled into place. it only goes in one way, in a specific place, so pay attention because force is required and forceful install in wrong place will destroy it. since it is a hard plastic, i could see where the plastic mounting tabs showed stress from the install.  i worried they would break off during my efforts.  important to know that these are side-specific, you need to buy a right or a left to fit the need because it cannot switch between them.  when one breaks, the others carry the load and break sooner so buy spares. ensure your purchase specifies right, left, or both."
Perfect space and size. I have no cabinet space and this works perfectly. But you can't put a regular size plate in it. Still serves their purpose.
"We love this. One of our favorite parts of the kitchen remodel. Such a space-saver and it just IS cool. I read some negative reviews - all stemming from not have a revolving plate and might be damaged if someone pushes down on it? Well duh. I have a 5yo and 8yo - they know not to stand on/in the microwave. And it's 2015 - who needs a revolving plate? I use a microwave for quick stuff, not rotisserie chicken and what-not. We are super-pleased with this microwave."
am very happy with  this
I didn't measure well and this wonderful piece of equipment was much too large so I had to return it So sorry I'd have loved to keep it
Great!
Installed easily and looks great. It's only been in use for about a month but we have no complaints. Fan is quiet.
good machine
great microwave.  simple and compact.
Great value for the money
"We opted for this style of microwave this time around in our new kitchen and have not been disappointed! The shipping was fast (thanks to Amazon), the look of the microwave is wonderful and goes well with our other appliances (GE Monogram & DCS), the drawer opens and closes well, it cooks wonderfully, it's quiet, controls are simple to use, the kitchen timer is handy...I know there were some negative posts, but as of now, after 4 months of use, I couldn't be happier!"
Great little microwave!
Really worked. The once rusty bottom inside of my microwave looks brand new.
"Prompt shipment, great quality. Stylish microwave, perfect for limited counter space."
Great item and seller!
5 star very happy with it
Simply the best microwave we have ever owned
As described. A great little microwave for the price!
Great product
Powerful and beautiful microwave.
Very good product for the price.
"Great product, looks nice... Exactly what we were looking for. Arrived in great shape two days after we ordered it!"
"He has worked perfectly right out the box. It was simple to set up and easy to use. I've used it to defrost meat, make beverages, bake potatoes etc etc and its been great. Excellent value for money. It lived up to its Consumer Report's Best Buy status"
"Absolutely fine.<br />Actually, I recommended it to a friend.  It was the right size for her.<br />She ordered and received from you.  Fits perfectly for her too.<br />I like the handle on the door.  Makes it easier."
Fits in my studio without taking up to much space. I have no down side to comment on this little microwave. It functions perfectly for what I need it for...which is heating bowls of isomalt for working hot sugar art. Love it!
This is a great little microwave. It fits perfectly in my tiny space so that I have a little more needed counter space than I did with my larger microwave
Perfect size for my dinner plates. I like the express cook buttons that allow me to hit one button to start cooking. Cooking times for store bought frozen foods seems to be just right for this microwave. Good quality for a low price.
I am in a wheelchair.  Cannot stand to reach our over the stove microwave.  Purchased this to place on he counter.  Now I can microwave to my hearts content.  Works great and priced right.  Would recommend it to everyone.
Exactly what I wanted.
Looks great for the price and works well! Could not ask for more.
love this! Good size for countertops<br /><br />had it since January 2015 and loved every minute of it.
It's great
"Great stuff.  Saved me from having to buy new oven.  It's been a year, and it's still good."
"My over the range microwave died and the manufacturer no longer makes the model I have.  Because it will take me some time to find what will look correct with what I now have, I needed a microwave oven quick!  Took a chance, because I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and purchased the Danby 0.7 cu. ft. countertop.  I couldn't be more pleased.  It works just great for what I need and it arrived in two days!"
"Fast delivery, great microwave!"
"Great small size, easy to clean. Amazing price!"
Very nice little microwave and doesn't take up a ton of space on the counter.
"Great little unit. Only big enough for one dinner plate, but does the job well."
"The microwave and is nicer then I expected for the price. It is stainless steel inside and out. they also include a replacement key pad cover. the only thing I do not like is the glass turntable did not come with a wheeled undercarriage to allow for smoother rotation, but other then that very nice and I would by again."
This part was exactly what I needed to repair my microwave - easy install.
Fits under my cabinet & is pretty quiet.  I've only used it to heat up things & works great.  Takes up only a small amount of countertop.
"Great product, really like it, and the price was amazing.<br />I got in time and it was pack well.<br />I would recommend it to others, one caveat let's hope it last a few years.<br />Martha"
Just the right size. Not too big.....not too small.
Good paint to touch up the interior of a microwave
Part was received on time and works perfectly.
"big enough for me, easy to use controls, great price"
"Very , very good i event toast bread in it, thank you SAMSUMG and AMAZON TOOOOO"
It works fine.
"Exactly what we hoped for in every way.<br />After needing to retire our well-loved Advantium, we opted to replace it with a more-basic microwave.<br />After rewiring from 220 (what the Advantium required) to regular ol' 110, we bought this GE microwave-combo<br />and had it installed. What separates this unit from other combination models? Well, for one...<br />We can use the timer AND the microwave at the same time; Something we kind of took for granted<br />in having had the Advantium for so many years.No other microwave seems to have this stupidly-basic<br />feature, something we learned the hard way by initially purchasing a top-rated Sanyo unit.<br />(And they questioned US when we kvetched about the timer/use of microwave conflict, insisting we were<br />asking for too much; Right...)<br />Back to this GE: Stainless steel interior is wickedly-easy to clean, the 'beep' tone isn't obnoxious, and the heating<br />element cooks evenly.<br />Just perfect in all ways; Can't say more about it.<br />Thanks!"
easy to install.looks great.
Good microwave.
It has been about two months and my husband and I love this microwave. We have plans of putting it in our new island as a built in. It looks great and works really well. The convection feature is a huge bonus.  I would buy again.
"I wanted a small microwave to heat food more than cook it in the first place. For example, I bake a large casserole in my oven, keep it in the fridge, then later heat meal-sized portions. This Danby model is perfect for that. Occasionally, I'll prepare a frozen dinner or pizza and its good for that too as long as the food container does not exceed the 9 inch (or so) interior rotating cooking surface.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, and that is this is a 700 watt microwave. Most food packages show microwave times for 1100 watt microwaves. This means you must cook things longer with 700 watts. No problem: Do an internet search for &#34;microwave 700 watt conversion chart&#34; and you'll see plenty of charts you can print. I posted one I printed to the inside of a cupboard door and consult it when I need to convert the 1100 cooking time shown on the food package for my 700 watt Danby. Example: 4 minutes at 1100 watts shown on package = 6 minutes 17 seconds on a 700 watt microwave.<br /><br />This is a small sized unit with 700 watts of power. It may no be for everyone. However, it meets my needs exactly. Also, it looks and performs well. I have had no problems with it. I'm a satisfied customer."
"took off rust under turntable with dremel motto,<br />then applied three coats ann hour apart<br />VERY HAPPY"
Love the microwave. It works great and adds such style and flare to our kitchen.
"Fantastic, love this little bastard.  Saves my counter space and looks great."
"Everything we wanted in a microwave.  All black looks better than just black face.  Has the 30-second add-on feature which we both like.  Slides around, but that can be remedied with non-slip material.  Has a nice &#34;lip&#34; at bottom so can be clasped while pressing buttons or starting which prevents slipping in the first place.  Great price for product--but time will tell for sure."
Everything was perfect!
Was drawn to this one after reading all of the positive reviews! They were spot on! I'm very happy with this purchase!!
Worked great. Looks like a new microwave.
Nice product for the price.  Delivered quickly.
"Awesome microwave, seems much expensive than i paid for it!"
"It fits perfectly under my cabinets - the measurements given by everyone are accurate! I was terrified this would blow the ancient fuses on my already electrically overtaxed retro apartment, but it runs with just a small dimming of lights. WHEW. It heats nicely and is quite spacious. The only annoying thing is that start/stop are the same button, but &#34;cancel&#34; is a tiny button near the top of the panel. So often I go to clear the screen from leftover time and end up starting the darn thing again. I am used to cancel/stop being the same button! I'll reprogram myself. In the meantime, I love it.<br /><br />Side note: There is a cardboard-y thing stuck to the side of the microwave which is not mentioned in the other reviews or in the manual - LEAVE IT THERE. If you go to the manufacturer's website, you can find out it's a mica panel to protect a vent. It's tempting to toss it because it looks out of place with the rest of the shiny chrome, but just leave it."
"Trim kit, bought along with the GE microwave is just fine. Not large enough to fill the gap in the kitchen cabinets since it is replacing the large size GE Advantium built in microwave. Had to get cabinet installer to fill the gaps between the cabinetry and trim kit. Looks fine. Is perfect if the area you are using it in is the exact same size, so watch out for that."
Big enough for a plate of food.  Works great! Doesn't take up the whole counter.
"Great price, 1000 watts Works perfect"
"good Price for good product<br />The price was right and now after some three months of use, I've not had any problems with it"
the paint did a great job. would buy again.
Nice
"So far, so good. I've been using it for about a month, it is a smaller size and less oppressive in my small kitchen. Intuitive controls. No complaints."
Very nice small microwave! Small footprint but still powerful enough. Also good for putting it on a higher place - like on top of the fridge - all the controls are at the bottom part.
Great design.  Compact and efficient.  Easy to use.
"Love it! Just as described, works great!"
"e z fix fit perfectly, worked great"
"Fantastic microwave. I bought it to replace a PoS GE micro that failed in less than a year. Very powerful, very intelligent settings and very attractive."
My old microwave is going strong! Planned obsolete is no longer going to take me over. Paint works great. Prep took a while as old paint may not like the new paint and bubble. So prep!
Really nice fit and finish STAINLESS INTERIOR wipes clean GET IT
Perfect size. And it works great.<br />I love it..
"This is exactly what I was looking for . Not too large but will hold a dinner plate . Heats food well. Love the Express Cook feature, simply push  1,2 ect for however many minutes you want, it starts , runs till finished. Also like the fact display goes back to clock time instead of saying END like my previous one. Could not be happier ."
"It has the 3 things I cared about - a light that goes on when you open the door, a quick one touch feature (30 seconds) plus single minutes, and it is the right size and power for my uses."
Works great for the price!!
"Innovative shape, perfect for limited coutnerspace in a small apartment"
"Love this microwave!  Perfect size for our office counter, works very well and looks nice."
Perfect for a countertop.
"Good, cheap microwave!  I was able to tuck this into a cabinet which is great, since I do not like a lot of clutter on the counters.  No complaints!  Works as expected.  For what it is... a 5/5 stars."
Perfect fit. I went to several appliance stores locally telling me I couldn't get one to fit. Love the look and bot microwave and convection  wok great.
Great product at a good price and easy to install.
"Perfect for my needs (compactness, appearance and performance). A very high quality product."
"Compact, stylish and very efficient. Wish it was all stainless steel."
This microwave is fantastic.  It fits into the corner of the countertop which I consider the dead space.  I am unable to reach most things placed in this space but the microwave is perfect.  I have more counter space.  I would rate the performance a 15 out of 10 because it's so great.
Good value for money. Satisfied
"Fits into my cabinet space perfectly, glass rotating plate does not shift as my other microwave did. A good deal"
very good works great
Very nice and useful product
Got it quickly & it works great
"It is just the right size, it doesn't crowd the space!"
"I love this little microwave!  I previously owned a large Panasonic 1250w monster that was awesome, however, after it unceremoniously died after only a couple of years, I was looking for something that wouldn't quiet eat up so much counter space.  After coming across this one, I was a tad reluctant to pull the trigger on this little guy for a couple of reasons: #1 - What if it was actually TOO small? & #2 - It didn't have the crazy power of my last one & I'm impatient.  Alas, I bit the bullet & have been VERY happy with it ever since!  I've realized that I never actually *cook* dishes in the microwave (totally not counting late night Easy Mac liaisons), so it's actually perfect for me for heating up leftovers, making popcorn, heating up water, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that even with less power than my last, I still don't feel like I am waiting any longer to get my food hot.  It was a little weird not having a number pad to select a specific time for about a day; now it's no big deal at all.  I usually just press the start button a few times, getting the time up to whatever I want it to be & let it go.  I would highly recommend this microwave for anyone who has similar usage as I, as well as someone who wants to free up some room in a small kitchen."
"Arrived in well conditon, good quality product"
"I love it However I had to return it and Repair my old one as the DOOR Hinge did not Allow for flush placement on Left side, as its in a RV and thats the way RV MFG installed it"
"We love our new microwave! I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this machine. It works great, and was delivered speedily. Thank you, Danby, for an affordable microwave that really works well!"
"II had the same problem that many people do with the GE Caf&eacute; microwave. The paint was peeling off after a couple of years and GE would not stand behind their product so I bought this paint and masked off the interior's good areas sanded and prepped and cleaned real well and sprayed a couple of coats. Sprayed really nicely, covered well, not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long. Dried quickly, minimum odor, nice sheen looks like new. This was a good fix although I think it's probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but I'm hoping that using this bought me a couple more years. The product came quickly and I was very happy. I would only wish that there was a little bit more in the can but for what it's advertised for it's perfect."
"Better than what's available at Sears, works great, easy installation (I didn't like the black center as it doesn't match our kitchen, but for the price I'm living with it...)"
This kit fixed my microwave and it arrived before the weekend.
Excellent microwave and excellent convection oven combined in one compact unit.
Works great not loud at all and small enough for my small kitchen. Affordable price and shipping was fast.
i think it met and exceeded my expectation.You need atleast 2 to paint the entire microwave ( 2 layer).I am new to this ..but it delivered good results.Thanks
"We bought this unit for a remodeled high end kitchen.  I has been installed for approximately six months and we are extremely happy with our purchase. No issues whatsoever. I love the easy automatic open/close feature and not having to bend down to put items in the microwave. The unit holds much larger plates and platters than I was able to put in my former microwave, which is really nice. It also has many useful features such as a sensor that can tell how much an item needs to be heated to be ready. As this was part of a kitchen remodel I simply told the product number to our kitchen cabinet company and they made the cabinets such that it would fit in perfectly as a built in.  The item fits in well with our suite of other stainless steel appliances.  No complaints. I highly recommend."
"Fabulous oven, great price, so easy to use!  Really glad I found this - have the 4.4 cu ft all refrigerator on it's way too!"
"Works great! Sorry for the delay; I just got my microwave working today (2-25-15). I was not certain if it was the magnetron and diode  causing the problem, but since the magnetron (in my oven) was 10 years old, I figured that might be the problem. However (after installing the new kit) my General Electric (JEM31WA  002) was still not functioning. So, I ordered new door switches (and after checking my old oven switches) I learned that the &#34;bottom&#34; (Normally open) door switch was not functioning. So, I changed it out, and &#34;voila,&#34; my microwave is functioning perfectly! It took some time, but it is worth it! I don't regret changing out the magnetron and diode (as my old ones were probably on their way out, anyway! (I had not troubleshot  the old magnetron tube. If they are still in working order, perhaps I can use them again, later! My most gracious thanks go out to Martin Microwave Inc. and Amazon; PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL INDEED!"
The machine is attractive and is performing within the range of all advertised claims and meets expectations. The control logic is intuitive and practical.
"Love this microwave! I have limited space in my kitchen, it slides perfectly in the corner!"
one of the best micro-waves I ever had
I love this microwave. I only require quick reheating or a baked potato every once in awhile. It's the perfect size!
Love my new microwave.  It looks great and works great too.  Love not having the microwave on the counter!
"Great service, very good for a small and compact microwave. Very reasonable price"
Heats fast. Reliable. Amazing for the price!
Delivery was on time the microwave look great more better then the picture and very good size very happy with this microwave
"Good product, stainless inside is easy to clean with rounded corners. Designed well."
"Looks good, and seems to be holding up a couple of months later."
I gotta say... This microwave looks slick in my kitchen. Nice LED display... Sleek metal Samsung look... Goes nice with my new Samsung Washer and Dryer set ;) Also works great and the controls are laid out intuitively!
Decent size and good finishing. Works great!
I had a small paint chip on the inside that would spark because bare metal was exposed. A couple of coats of this paint saved the day. It has a use that is far more than cosmetic. It saved me about $175 because I did not have to buy a replacement microwave of similar quality because I did not trust using a paint that was not microwave friendly.
"WOW- my microwave looks like new! This paint is very high quality and covers very well. I needed only 1 coat but did 3 coats just to use up the can because if I ever need to paint this old thing again, its probably gonna be time for replacement."
"Excellent microwave!  We had very limited counter top space and didn't want to take up a lot of that precious space with a full-size microwave oven.  This product fit the bill perfectly.  It's been working great for several months now, no complaints at all!"
"I purchased this drawer microwave from Amazon for a new custom designed kitchen we were installing in our home.  My wife couldn't understand why I wanted it because she had never seen one before and didn't think the whole &#34;drawer thing&#34; was a good idea.  She eventually (reluctantly) agreed because she didn't want a microwave to go over the stove and there were no other good options for our kitchen design.  Once it was installed, she said she liked the looks of it (built into the island).  Everyone else that has seen it really likes the way it looks also because it's kind of unique.  When my wife used it the first time I don't think she wanted to admit I actually had a good idea but the drawer microwave works perfectly and it's easy to get cookware in and out since it's waist high with the door open.  My adult son used the &#34;sensor reheat&#34; button on a restaurant leftover meal he was warming up to eat.  The feature evidently &#34;senses&#34; the air inside the microwave as the meal is cooking and stops automatically when it's ready.  Pretty cool feature!  I love the microwave.  It adds to the custom kitchen design look and it works great.  (I think my wife even smiled one time when she used it)"
It arrived in perfect shape and I just had to plug it in.  I have been using it every day even though I have an over the stove one too.  It is so handy to do small jobs along with the big one.
Perfect fit in my tiny kitchen.  Love the cool blue digital read-out!
I bought this for a gift for a family member about 500 miles away. He says he's very happy with it and that's all I need to know
works very well
"Over the range microwaves are a wonderful way to save counter space. This one gives you the option of venting the fan to duct work, or back into the kitchen, and fit under my standard height cabinets very well. Be advised that this requires a 20 amp GFI outlet to be installed inside the cabinet over your stove. This isn't hard to work out, because chances are in a newer house, your existing vent hood has electrical for it's fan and light. Watch a few youtube videos of these being installed and you should be fine."
Quality Merchandise..  Great value.
Had it installed for a few weeks now and works fine. It's a microwave. You plug it in. Fan speeds are great. First time ordering an appliance online and so far very happy.
perfect for my application
I've had this a relatively short time so my review is subject to update. the controls require a little reading to understand but other than that this is like something from the kitchen of the future. The automatic pop out / pop in is smooth and quiet. The power is sufficient to get the job done quickly and the microwaves are dispersed so there are no hot spots.
"Solved the problem, Easy to remove and install, just like the video shows."
Great item. Works well.
Great Product- Fast Shipment
great suction not noisy
Worked as advertised. Like the other reviews preparation is the key. First I cleaned the microwave thoroughly.  Next I taped off all the areas I did not want painted. I took the microwave outside and placed on a bench. I sanded down all the loose paint and rust with a sanding stone.  I sprayed several thin layers of paint waiting about 15 minutes between coats to let dry. I probably sprayed 20 coats. You could smell the new paint for a couple of days. It has been a couple of months and there has been no chipping.  Good product.
Great microwave. It is much more expensive than the typical small microwave but is worth it for something of better quality and at least some elegance of design. Controls are simple and light to the touch. I don't miss having a numeric keypad.
great space saver.
"We needed a new microwave and after reading the reviews bought this one. Great microwave! Easy to use. Fits in the corner perfectly! Great for thawing, reheating and light cooking.  Really saves space. Makes great popcorn too!"
"Color matched great, easy repair."
Works great!
Great microwave for my home.
Great
Works perfectly
Great piece of cooking equipment. All as dedscribed.
"This thing is awesome. It looks just like a TV which cracks me up. It's a bit smaller than most microwaves in terms of counter-space, but also a bit taller. It has no number pad for entering a specific cook time; instead you just hit the start button multiple times to add 30 seconds. It is powerful and simple. No complaints."
Perfect fit.
Excellent product and service
good
Beautiful!!!!!
Works great
"A good, small, functional, no-frills oven."
"We decided to put up a chimney exhaust in our new kitchen, so a bulky, over the range microwave was out. Plus, we never use it to &#34;cook&#34; from scratch. Why have such a giant wasting space? My dear, handy, wood worker husband built our new cabinets, so it was no problem to create a perfect space under the counter for a new smaller microwave. Love the drop down door. Plus the features are incredible: SlimFry, convection, and grill!! Note: The Samsung is not meant for under the counter, however we were able to provide plenty of air circulation, so it has not been a problem,"
"Love this little microwave.  We recently sold our home and have had to live temporarily in a small one bedroom with very little counter space.  I found this one and based on reviews, decided to buy it and I am not disappointed.  Works better than any microwave I have ever owned before!  Very pleased with my purchase!"
"I've had this microwave for a couple of months and I have no problems with it, it is working very well."
Great for the money
After several months of use I'm happy to report it's still running strong. It heats food evenly with cold areas and is large enough to fit just about everything I cook. The sleek design and color also look nice in my kitchen.
LOVE IT.
Great Unit!! We use it in our Semi and it works wonderfully well. Great size and shape for a compact area. I would definately recommend this unit .
"Easy install, no video or instructions required. If you can get out to see where it is, you can get to it and install it. Unit is running fine with no issues."
"I love this microwave. Small is what I needed but, wow what great extra features and it is beautiful. I am beyond happy! Yes it is small but, that is what I needed and what I am used to. I can't get my largest dinner plate in but, I can get my smaller ones in. I love how the back is rounded. I had a Sharp Half Pint that finally died after 24 yrs. This has way more features than the Sharp. I have very little counter space so, thank goodness I found this. Yes, it is pricey but, well worth the money to me. UPDATE &#62;&#62;&#62;I  purchased it 12/20/14 and it died April 3rd/2015. Whirlpool has been  very nice and will be sending a replacement."
Really nice!
"Super cute. Works great. Because it's compact, some bowls and plates fit a little snug and the rotating plate has no off. Otherwise, it's fantastic."
Fantastic product. Made microwave look brand new again.  Has a strong odor for the first day.  Dries quick and looks great.
"I love this microwave. I needed something that could go in my new kitchen island and I did not want to spend a fortune for something that had mediocre ratings. This microwave has had mixed reviews but it is working great for our household. I would say the only somewhat negative is that the door is slightly slow to open, compared to a regular microwave door that opens manually. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase."
"heats great, gets very hot .."
Nice size for an apartment :)
Works great no issues
Great buy
Perfect for apartments
Very pleased.  We put the unit inside a cabinet with a sliding shelf.  One less thing exposed in the kitchen.
The 3rd one in almost 15 yrs.  A good reliable model.
"what can you say about a microwave ?? It does the job looks nice , I am happy with it and the big plus it was delivered right to my door . No hunting around , carrying it in and out of auto ."
Seems to be good quality
awesome replacement. great quality with bells and whistles
Put in my older 2001 GE spacemaker microwave oven. Works perfect and same replacement number.
Love the size and design!  I have had it for over 6 months and still working well with no issues.
Love my little microwave oven!
"Great range and matched my whirlpool stove perfectly.  There was a little dent on the side, but it was not visible once it was installed.  great<br />Buy and if needed in the future, I would purchase this item again.  Works fabulously and is very nice and easy to use."
this is a very nice microwave.. very easy to use with a great size to accommodate just about any item you need to prepare. Works fast and I would highly recommend it
"Although the add listed the unit as &#34;used&#34; it was in fact brand new and I am thrilled to my socks!!!!! It is installed in our Motorhome and works like a charm! Thank you,thank you,Thank you!"
Perfect for what I needed! I love this microwave.
"Exactly what we were looking for. It has been working great for several months now. It was perfect for our very limited space, a microwave box suspended below the cabinet and off the counter. It is quite a nice stainless steel look, complementing other appliances and black granite."
This is a great microwave!
"Shipping was fast and the packing was supreme. Easy to install, we are doing a remodel and I had my points to use. So happy I used them on this microwave. My other appliance are whirlpool and it looks great with everything."
Perfect size for my small kitchen.  Very attractive.  Easy to operate and performs well.
Worked great.
This Sharp drawer microwave is amazing!  It has buttons to both open and close the drawer for you.  We love the easy &#34;top loading&#34; system.  Plus..........it looks great!  We highly recommend this item.
I thought I would wait to make sure everything was working correctly before I commented. The microwave is the perfect fit for my kitchen. It works exactly as expected and I was surprised a dinner plate fits too. It takes up a corner of my counter but it's very sharp looking.  I've had many compliments. I am a very satisfied customer.
"It is a great microwave.  Had to replace the one that came with the house (same model) since my boyfriend burned the inside of it.  It is quick, quiet and I love all the features about it.  Easy to keep clean unless you date my boyfriend...then he will burn it one way or another so keep him out of the kitchen."
"It perfect for a studio or smaller kitchen. It fits a standard 10.5 inch IKEA dinner plate just fine with space to spare, but anything much larger would probably not fit.<br /><br />Power wise its fine (it takes 2:30 to 3:00 minutes to bring a mug of water to boil) and heats up my leftovers just fine. Clean design and stable carousel that rotates 360 degrees as it cooks. One reviewer complained about an unstable carousel, but I think they forgot to install the circular runner that provides support on the periphery of the carousel glass plate. The runner is taped to the inside packaging with the owners manual."
"This turntable is exactly like the one that came with the microwave.  The original cracked because my son dropped it, so found this one on Amazon and it works fine."
"Looks good, works well. Does the microwave thing. Venting is open at the top, though. Things can fall in. That's a strange design."
What a great value!
"No issues, I love the product!"
"This microwave has a very elegant design.  The engineers were able to minimize its footprint by putting most of its electronics on the bottom instead of on the side.  I would prefer green LEDs instead of blue, but mostly I'm happy that it fits on our counter and under the cabinets without taking up much space."
love it so far!
Excellent product. Saved our microwave!
Great item !!!!
Product has not default but the weight is way too much for the size of the microwave. Easy to use. Could the weight has something to do with the power of the engine? Only the technicians will be able to say something about it. But will definitely recommend it to whoever is looking for good but affordable microwave. Outstanding for the prize.
Creates a perfect custom look.
"we have been using this microwave for a few weeks and so far are happy with our purchase. it was easy to install, looks nice, and is doing a fine job of heating up our food.  we have no concerns at this time."
"Very much enjoying this range! I used to have double wall ovens and a Jenn Air cooktop with grill/griddle. We've downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that I had with that setup.<br /><br />The small oven is perfect for 95% of the needs for my wife and I, but I do expect the large oven will get a work-out at Thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner. The Power Boil is terrific, and the grill/griddle is very handy and easy to clean.<br /><br />I debated quite a bit between this and the PGB950SEFSS. The main differences:<br /><br />* This model has a porcelain top surface, the 950 is stainless<br />* The 950 has a double-ring, 19,000 BTU boil burner - this has a single-ring 17,000 BTU<br />* The 950 has dual broiler burners, this has one broiler<br />* The 950 has a ball-bearing roller rack (I believe just one of the three) where this has all standard slide racks<br />* $700 MSRP price difference<br /><br />To be honest I prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically, but that's definitely a matter of opinion. The other features just didn't add up to $700 for me. I did use the broiler for a small frittata and that worked fine, but I can see how the double broiler could provide more even heat on a larger dish. The Power Boil is excellent on this, I don't see 10% higher BTU making a tremendous difference.<br /><br />I also considered these other five-burner double-oven ranges: Frigidaire FGGF304DLF, KitchenAid HGRS505XSS, LG LDG3036ST, and Whirlpool WGG7550BS.  All have their benefits and drawbacks but the GE has the largest ovens and I got a good price through Amazon."
working well. good size and good price . I like this.
Worked Perfectly!
Excellent product. I recommend it
"Delivered in 2 days, a day ahead than promised. Good product, many features and easy to use."
Works Great
"Great microwave and very fancy, but it does get hot when you used it. I usually leave it open for a few minutes when I finished using it."
The item was fine. The price was great too compared other sellers.
I bought this for my brother and he said it is great.  Great price point and it works really well.
Very pleased with my purchase.
Works great
"The Danby 1100w Microwave oven has proven to be the right purchase for my apartment. The unit is fairly compact given it's power rating, and because I have limited counter space size does matter to me! In my opinion the Danby is an excellent product (and made in America!)."
Very good
Hard to beat for the price. Bought this for a temporary living situation and couldn't ask for more for the price. As an older person the only improvement would be larger buttons for the start/stop but that would add cost. Cooks fast and is an excellent choice.
Great product for the money.
"Looked large in the box, but fits nicely over the range.  Looks great and works great.  Has met all expectations and for a lot less than other microwaves for more."
Great price easy to use
"impressive for the price,works great. Quiet and powerful. opening the door is two handed sometimes but a good value."
Everything is good so far. The price was low and I didn't know the brand. But took a chance. I have had no problmns.
A very nice product! I especially like the night light.
"Great!  seems to be holding up just fine.  I sanded and cleaned the area as directed and put on several coats, allowing the paint to dry in between coats. I finished it off with a light sanding using extra fine sand paper. The color is slightly off, but otherwise it looks and feels like new.  I also have plenty left should I need to touch."
"It  works very  well. It's easy to use. It' runs quieter then our old one.  And  it heats and reheats everything we want. The only thing I notice is it's very  light weight. It tips easily, if you lean on it."
I have a small kitchen. This fit perfectly in a corner on the counter. It looks super cute and I have received several compliments.
"It's small, and fits perfectly in a corner. Microwaves things."
"I just got it today, Works great, Just the right size, Just the right price<br /><br />You could not get a better one for this price."
"Not very big, fit into my small kitchen just fine."
"This small microwave has worked well for my small kitchen. Pretty basic features, but has worked fine."
"We purchased and installed this over the range microwave as a replacement for a 25 year old one.  This is Sharp is just perfect.  We required one with the recirculating feature because we have no way to vent it, and this type is not easy to find."
"I just received this.  I was looking for the most compact microwave with the best reviews and this was it.  So far, I tried boiling a cup of water and fixed a baked potato.  It works just great.  Yes, I would recommend this."
"Family is so busy with working and kids. When old microwave died right after moving and expecting a baby, money was very tight. My mom saw our needs and purchased this microwave as a surprise . This little thing is just right for our smaller kitchen..it reheat foods fast and works great . Family is very pleased."
The person who designed this should have won a prize! Makes the most of a small corner space and is more efficient; about 20% more efficient. Great purchase!
great for work
"I love this little microwave. It fits on my countertop easily and does not take up a lot of space. It is large enough to heat everything I use a microwave for.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use. The high setting is only 700 watts which is less than the 1100 watts I was used to so cooking tends to take a bit longer.  The only minor annoyance I have after several days of use is that I have to remove the turntable to fit my coffee cup in the oven.  My cup measures 6&#34; tall and is just a tad too tall to fit with the turntable in. However, I found if I remove the turntable and set the cup on the spindle that turns, it fits perfectly."
Perfect
Worked so much better than I expected.  Two light coats and it looked like new.
"This is just adorable; not quite the power of my old AND HUGE microwave oven.  This one is SLEEK and SMALL and very high-tech looking.  It tucks in under my kitchen countertop and in a corner, out of the way.  I have to nuke things a bit longer with this one, but that's okay."
"Great item, good price...great quality."
very nice
"This stuff adheres well, dries quickly and leaves a washable surface.  I used it to replace bubbling paint on a microwave with a painted mild steel lined cavity."
This microwave cavity paint has worked out great so far!  We have a GE in-cabinet microwave/oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave I was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item.  So I sanded down the top of the microwave really well.  Be sure to get ALL loose paint off - should be totally smooth.  Then when the paint arrived I shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave.  It was actually a pretty good sized area I needed to cover.  After letting that coat dry for a couple hours I added a second coat and after a couple more hours I added a third coat.  I want to make sure it was coated good.  So far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great.  I showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now!  I let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use.  The smell is overwhelming and I would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face.  I would take a counter top unit outside to treat.  I didn't have that option so I had to just do it.
"love the microvave,especially the prompts which makes initial usage inherently friendly and easy to navigate.heats well-we're very satisfied with it."
"I love this new little microwave- I had no room in my small kitchen, but I hardly know it's there, it takes up so little space. The only thing I don't like is, there are 2 removable separate plastic parts under the glass plate turn table- more parts to worry about should they ever get lost. The plate rests on one of the plastic parts (the turner with wheels) which makes the plate about 1 and a half inches higher than the bottom- which makes smaller space to fit tall items. There is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit.<br />The whole unit is easy to clean- ALL, including the inside, is flat and smooth- no dials or protrusions. It has only a 30 second button, so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes- which perfectly heats a cup of coffee. The only easy cook button is for popcorn which only gives you 2 and a half minutes- I don't know why the manufacturer would choose &#34;popcorn&#34; when coffee/tea is used much more often. This small microwave fits my big dinner plates easily. I am very happy with this product- so easy to use and clean."
"Same as it was described, best part, I did not have to go anywhere, it came to my house right  on rime"
"Very well made and easy to install, Great shipping on this bulky item."
Excellent!  Easy install. Microwave works like new.
"Even though it's a GE magnetron, it solved my Frigidaire model PLMV168CC1 over- the-range microwave no-heating problem. Saved us of having to buy a new microwave. Happy outcome!!!"
"Look around at microwaves and you will typically see they are all the same rectangular shape. If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. A magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. They should have built this with non-slip feet. I cut a couple of squares of that non-slip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The inside of this unit is very small. Keep that in mind. It is a tall unit, but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item. You can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem. I would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here. 5 1/2&#34; would leave only a very thin space at the top and I don't know how that would work out.<br /><br />These small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space."
Works great
I was a little worried about the quality of this trim kit after reading previous reviews.  But the thing is beautiful!  My husband had to do some work to fit the thing in our space.  The results were wonderful.  And now I have a built-in microwave in stainless steel to match my other newer appliances.  The look is very nice.
Very roomy compared with my last one. Its very quiet and heats well. So far so good.
effiient spacious easy quiet fast doe what it supposed to do I purchased this for my office and am more than glad i did
This is a perfect kitchen microwave. I am thrilled with it. Great price for the value you get. Must say I am very satisfied.
"I purchased this to repair my microwave and to save big bucks on a new one, it's been a while since I purchased it and it is still turning steady and strong great product"
"i LOVE this microwave, it is cool, works great, and frees up the counter. it fit seamlessly into the required hole listed in the specs, and if you want a range hood and not a microwave over the stove, this is the only way to go"
"For the price you pay, you get what you pay for. It does the job, its a little on the small side, but that is what it is! Happy with what I got, till I can afford a bigger one."
awesome product and delivery. microwave looks spanking new now. you cant find this product in stores lord only knows i hope i wont be diagnosed cancer in a couple of years as.  result.
Prep surface carefully.  Be sure to leave no residue on surface to be painted.  Use multiple thin coats.  Allow sufficient time between coats for it to dry.  The color matches my microwave very well.
"It works well. Does everything I bought it for. Easy to set  and operate. Does take a while to warm up for baking, but operating on 110v it is to be expected"
"Perfectly fit in my kitchen, and power is OK. it has everything I need for a basic microwave. I've been using it for several days, haven't found any problem yet."
"This may be more expensive than other microwaves, but trust me when I say it is totally worth it for the design and counter savings."
"Great product, have owned 4 Sharp Carousel microwaves over the past 30 years or so and they always stand out over other microwaves I have used at friends and families homes. The ease of use and guaranteed result is worth it every time. The microwave is stylish and easy to clean, the design has changed little in the 3 decades because it works and does not need changed. The size as well is perfect for cooking anything microwavable. Having 1200 watts is a huge plus when cooking things like baked potatoes and frozen stuff that on a lesser powered microwave would take longer then posted times, but this oven will do the job in less time more often than not!  It is a stylish powerhouse!"
I recommend this product because it works. Rarely do you find a product that works as well as it says. Read the instructions carefully and it will do the job.
LOVE IT!!!!!  I AM HAPPY WITH MY  PURCHASE<br /> AND LOOK FORWARD TO MY NEXT DEAL.<br />KEEP THE DEALS CINUBG.  LOL
"Arrived in two days instead of the week as reported, this was a great plus. It fit into the same spot as old Sharp, another plus. The mounting brackets were in a different location & constructed less sturdy than the old ones. The medal was cheaply made & much thinner. Overall I am happy with purchase."
This is the perfect microwave for my household. It is basically used for heating water and food. Couldn't ask for anything better.
This microwave is perfect for a compact kitchen. I have more counter space that is now useable than I had before. It's small foot print is a blessing. It is large enough to accommodate my needs. The interior is spacious enough to reheat dinners or a slice of pizza. I like making popcorn in it. Would recommend this to anyone who has a small kitchen and is need of a unit with a smaller foot print.
"Small package, but large inside. It will fit a full size plate. Perfect counter microwave. Takes up very little space in the corner. We love it. We have had many comments on how cool it looks from friends."
We got this as a backup when our large microwave broke.  It does a nice job and it's nice to have an extra one when more than one person wants to use it.  The smaller size is really nice and doesn't take up a lot of space.
Works great.. and really great size for cooking multiple items.  easy to use without a lot of fancy buttons. I recommend this to others. But be sure of the size as this is a very large over the stove microwave.
"I love this. The cord is on the right, and short, I could have used the word on the left but other than that (because of my outlet location) it deserves a full 5 stars. It does reach to my outlet, but would have been nicer on the left for the location I have the microwave. Other than that, I love this little microwave, I do have too cook things 30-60 seconds longer however, the space I save it worth the extra cooking time. Heats up food, frozen vegetables, and makes small bagged popcorn perfectly. Fits a full sized plate or paper plate, fits a 10&#34; bowl about 5 inches high and that leaves some space too the top. This is not for cooking meals, small things only in my opinion and just what I needed and wanted."
It is perfect for my needs for space.  Size is good and so far performance has been good The extra rack is a nice addition
Exact device needed to solve my GE microwave problem. My wife is happy now ... so I can be happy too!
This was an excellent shopping experience.  I wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these. Great Shopping Experience.
"People always ask what the hell is that thing parked on the fridge, its the perfect size for me to warm up a single dish or a coffee! I dont cook in a microwave, its functional and its beautiful!"
"You can actually repair a Sharp Microwave that stops turning<br /><br />You'll be fooled at first because usually to fix some appliance, you remove the cover, or case, or housing, or whatever you call it --- the Cabinet.  Don't.  In fact, on a Sharp Microwave, they used some screws to hold on the cabinet that you don't have the wrench for.  It's like saying, &#34;These arent' the screws you're looking for.&#34;  (You don't need to see his identification papers,)<br /><br />The arcane baffling steps that aren't explained anywhere and that you haven't experienced before --<br />1. The little perforated plate near the center of the back, after you turn it upside down, is removed by ripping it away manfully.  Never done that before on ANYTHING.  No screws,  just hack at it.  You'll be thinking, &#34;But if I bend it and twist it, how will it go back on? &#34;  Well, first of all, you can dispense with it; but if you feel like it, you can flatten it and then turn it over and you'll see how it has little tabs on it to reinstall it.<br /><br />Actually , once you get that little perforated plate off there, it's trivially simple.<br /><br />Carry on."
I really love this microwave.  The design is modern and appealing and the function is ideal for application.  I am very satisfied with having this product on my kitchen countertop.
I use microwave just to rewarm my food. I barely use it to cook. The product is cheap and good for rewarming my food. I already used it for 2 months and have no problem. I don't know how long it is going to last. The product may also be good for cooking but I don't know since I don't cook with microwave.
"We needed a small microwave to fit in our newly refurbished 1995 VW Eurovan camper, and this one is perfect. It fits inside an existing cupboard. I had been researching small microwaves for a couple of months and noticed that most of them only had a light on when the microwave was in use, but not when the door is opened. This one lights when the door is opened which was important to us since it's in a small space rather than a brightly lit kitchen. Some reviewers complained that the glass plate didn't seem to fit or stay on the turntable mechanism. Despite this microwave being a different brand that the two we have at home, the turntable mechanism is the same, and it only fits together in one specific position. When it's properly aligned it pops into place and is very stable."
"Easy to use and doesn't take up alot of counter space. Also sits higher so it is easy to clean. A little shorter in height inside but it is just used for heating up food, not cooking a ham or turkey in it."
"This brand was cheaper than some of the other major brands; however, this one was highly rated by Consumer Reports. Got here in  2 days!"
"Purchased from Amazon and was received within 5 days (exceptional).  Since it was the same model as my old one, installation was very easy with no new holes or brackets to install.  So far it works very well and I consider it, at this point, an exceptional purchase."
We have a GE oven/microwave combo (the microwave has the oven controls on it) and the paint was coming off the microwave.  I was concerned it was dangerous so I considered replacing the entire unit.  Then we heard about this paint and thought it was worth a try.  My husband is quite handy so he did the sanding and spraying and the microwave looks brand new.  Couldn't be happier and it sure beat the price of replacing the unit.
"The appliance fits neatly my new kitchen perfectly, we hardly notice it is even there. The function works with all the setting of a regular machine, it just a lot smaller, the size a large dinner plate. I love it!"
"We were trying to find a microwave small enough to fit on the counter in our media room, but still large enough to make popcorn, and other things. This one fit the bill and it works great! We love it!"
"This is a good little unit. I wanted something of smaller dimensions so I could put it into my RV. It fit perfectly, and it works just fine. Very attractive and very quiet. It's taken a while to get used to the new controls, but that's just because they're different, not bad. I plan to buy another for a small trailer that I have. In short I would recommend this to anybody."
"With other microwaves, you lose not only it's own footprint in counter space, but also the clearance in front for the door to open.  With this one, the door opens 3 inches above the counter, plenty of room for other food prep. It tucks way back into the corner, previously wasted space.  It's heavy enough to stay put when pulling the door open, light enough to slide to the side for cleaning underneath.<br /><br />Some reviewers criticized the controls, but hey, anytime you get a new appliance, it takes a while to get used to the buttons.  Took me 2 rounds to decide the 30 second button was a great invention.<br /><br />My kids said &#34;Whoa, what's that!!!&#34; the first time they saw it.  I think that's high praise in kidspeak."
This product was easy to use and when the paint dried - the paint blended in and match the original inside paint perfectly!
Great item!!! It fits it perfectly. I really enjoyed getting this item. I definitely recommend anyone to purchase this item.
My turn table would not turn I ordered this part and put it in and the microwave is as good as new.
I had a ring of rust and metal on the bottom of my microwave oven.  My husband just wanted to buy a new oven but I had already ordered this product.  I worked great.  I followed direction I found online and my oven is like new again!
This was a replacement and the fit and quality was perfect.  I would recommend the product to anyone needing a replacement
"It is listed as stainless steel, but a magnet stuck tight to it.  This is not typical of stainless-not this much attraction.  Research through  Google showed some stainless is magnetic.  I knew this, but the attraction seemed too strong.Was this a stainless steel coating over iron-I do not know.<br /><br />The microwave has worked very well for me, I have no complaints.<br />Caution: Some cleaners can pit S.S. Amonia should NEVER be used on stainles!  IF-IF it was a S.S. coating and a PIT GOES to  TO THE IRON!<br /><br />My experience has been with microwaves that have the white enamel coating inside.  The coating starts to seperate  from the metal shell and fall into your food.  You remove it until it is almost all gone, leaving the exposed metal shell to rust.  This has happened to me several times.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Danby Designer from Amazon."
She Who Must Be Obeyed was ready to throw the microwave out as the interior was beginning to flake.  A little sand paper and paint and she welcomed it back into Her kitchen.  It feels good to go one up on this disposable society.
I bought this microwave for my college dorm room and their isn't a day that goes by that I regret it!<br /><br />This microwave is relatively quiet and very easy to clean. It is also the perfect amount of watts to keep the university off my back!
"My wife does 90% of the cooking in our home and I asked her what she thought of our new GE Cafe Series CSA1201RSS 1.7 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Advantium Speed Oven & Microwave and she said, &#34;I love it. I may never use our regular (range) oven again&#34;. I use it for the usual things that most men use it for. Popcorn, heating coffee, warming left overs and the like and for me, I think it is also great. It reheats just about anything I have tried to just the right temperature. If there are any cons with this appliance, I haven't run across them yet."
Ordered because my turntable inexplicably shattered after 5 years. This replacement was listed for my model number. Perfect fir. Great price. No problems.
"My microwave was rusting out badly and it is an undercabinet attached microwave.  I didn't want to have to buy a new one to fit in that small spot and I didn't want to have to remove the microwave to paint it.  So in a couple of hours, I cleaned the microwave (directions online), covered all surfaces from overspray, and used this paint.  Now I have a new microwave and I keep a clean sock filled with rice in it when it is not being used.  The rice absorbs the moisture so the microwave won't rust again.  I am very happy."
"I have a small kitchen and my old microwave was a full sized microwave that took up a large amount of cabinet space and seemed out of place because of its size.  Shopped around and found this smaller sized unit but was hesitant because it is 700 watts while my old unit was 1000 watts.  However, I have found that cooking time in this unit is insignificantly longer than the old microwave.  A few second for most things.  I don't actually cook in it but use it for warming left overs or frozen snacks, etc.  For my use it is perfect and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen rather than a huge distraction.  If you need a smaller sized microwave, I highly recommend this one."
Really enjoyed the drawer type microwave and the auto open feature is a plus.<br />Comes with full warranty even though is is a refurbished model.
"I was going to say despite its size, this is a wonderful microwave, but then I think the small size is the best part!  I bought it for my small kitchen, and it's not only adorable, it's a kick ass machine.  Love it!"
Part is as described. Arrived in a timely fashion. Installation was easy. Direct replacement for the magnetron in our 10 year old GE spacemaker. Microwave is working again!
"i was going to replace the microwave, checked it out and found it was the magnetron. ordered this, delivered FAST, fixed it for under a 100 bucks!"
"I really thought our built-in microwave was going to have to be replaced, because of the paint pealing away and rust forming where exposed.  To my amazement this inexpensive product solved my problem with ease.  Remember to have area well vented to the outside and to use a mask.  By using many light sprays you will prevent runs."
I've just had this microwave installed in my new kitchen. I wanted to find one that could go in my island and wouldn't  detract from my new cabinets. It's easy to use and is a great addition to my new kitchen.
This microwave oven was purchased for work.  Everbody likes it.  Never have any problems.  Would purchase the same kind next time.
We bought this for a new construction and haven't used it yet. It looks great and hope it works just as well.
"This microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking.  It's full-plate size, fine for heat-ups and smaller casserole dishes.  Best of all is the way it fits into a corner.  Yes it takes up space, is not &#34;tiny&#34; but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space.  Controls are easy to set.  Haven't had a microwave in years, and somebody suggested this.  I'm happy with it."
This small microwave does everything you need even without lots of bells and whistles.  It fits a corner if necessary and does as good a job as a larger microwave.  It's easy to clean.  I'm so pleased with my decision.
"This microwave is simple to use, and it works great.  At first I was a little apprehensive about the matt finish on it but once we got it installed, it looks great.  I love it!  My husband and I installed it...we only needed a basic drill, it took a couple of hours but we got it done."
Love this microwave! It heats food & drink up fast. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the compact size! Counter top clutter is one of my pet peeves~so this definitely opens up some counter space. It's so cute too!
Just needed for a touch up<br />But works great!  Will keep<br />On hand if see another chip<br />To be fixed
"My unit arrived quickly and in good order.  Took just a little time for my wife and I to mount this on the wall; the instructions were adequate for setting up the mounts etc.<br /><br />Been working perfectly, can't think of anything to complain about except there was another reviewer who commented on a design flaw of there being no proper cover to the exhaust vent on top; small items could fall into this area.  I would agree with them, though in my case there's nothing above that would fall into it."
"Oh my gosh!!! This is fantastic!! It saved sooooo much counter space. We have a family of 3 and it suits us perfectly. I had one of the big stainless microwaves, just took up so much counter space.<br />Only down side is you cannot type in a specific time for something to heat. You press the start button and it's automatic 30 seconds (press twice, 60...and so on) now that it's been a few weeks, I don't really miss the number bad. I'd rather save the space!!"
"We've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />And then we found this Whirlpool TV set, er, I mean microwave! Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace, physics and common sense!! It looks just like a cute little old school TV set. Imagine that! A cute microwave oven! But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! How'd they do that??!!<br /><br />Negatives? Nothing terrible. Yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! We use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute Whirlpool TV/microwave thingee will do just fine. Takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />And speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function. It's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game.<br /><br />Bottom line? Outstanding microwave!"
Made my 2005 Manufactured GE Spacemaker XL1800 work like new (man! there are a lot of different shells for the XL1800 depending on the year it was made!)! There was a small round diode-like item attached with 2-screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement. Simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick! I also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitor...why not? It was there.<br /><br />The whole deal took 2 1/2 hours start to finish - including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor (thanks neighbor!) to get help removing and remounting the microwave. Lots of videos on the web to help you along the way. Be patient and keep track of your screws!
This is a great product  Fixed my microwave like it was brand new  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has some paint chipping off the sides or top of their microwave
"This is a great microwave combination convection oven, the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that, but now my wife and I truly love it"
"We needed a small microwave when we moved into a small condo with very little counter space. Most of the reviews said this was the perfect solution and it is. It takes up very little room, plus it fits easily into a corner. It has a rotating glass tray that holds a standard size dinner plate. It's tall enough to fit a 16 ounce mug with room to spare, but it is shorter than many standard microwaves. It has digital controls that are very simple but work just fine. We're older and actually really appreciate that simplicity. Some things take longer to cook but not by much.<br />If you want all the bells and whistles and to be able to zap things quickly, this is not the microwave for you. On the other hand, if you need a smaller microwave that is easy to use and very sturdy I definitely recommend this one. We love it!"
"We needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet. We struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby. This one is a perfect fit. I was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others, so far it has worked great for our needs. Plus it looks great in the space."
We needed to create a little more space on the kitchen counter and this unit was perfect.  Nice looking machine and tucks into a corner.  Would recommend to others.
"Chosen for it's size, this microwave is pretty perfect for us. We use it for simple warm ups and reheating. It works great.<br /><br />It is surprisingly very heavy. Arrived very well packaged.<br /><br />I love how it sits back in the corner of the counter with the curved back."
This is an excellent Microwave and very big.  I am so very pleased with this product.  I think it is the favorite of my Grand kids in the kitchen!
"We picked this microwave primarily for its dimensions (we needed one with a short height). We are very pleased with this model since it is easy to use, works well and is very quiet. It's not loaded with features but has been a pleasure use over the last few months that we've owned it."
after reading either terrible or &#34;hit and miss&#34; reviews of other small footprint microwaves with &#34;handle doors&#34; rather than &#34;push button&#34; I came across this from Whirlpool..It had GREAT reviews so I tried it for our new granite countertop (didn't want to use up much space)... it is PERFECT!!
The unit was purchased to replace an old whirlpool unit that had performed flawlessly for 20 years. Although none of the holes lined up the Sharp unit fit perfectly into the space above our cooktop. So far the unit has performed as advertised.
"I bought this microwave about two years ago, and it still looks and functions great!  Have not had a single issue. :)"
This is stuff. It really worked very well. It save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well. I highly recommend this product.
"As all the other reviews have said, the footprint of this microwave is fantastic. I can't believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave. I now have so much more room on my counter.<br />The only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time. The start button adds thirty seconds every time it's hit or you can add the + key to get a more accurate time. I always use my microwave for quick reheating so it's not a big deal to me. Worth getting used to for the extra space gained. Plus, it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less."
"I researched many microwaves for our needs, and this is the perfect unit. It is my second one, as the first I had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store, it arrived damaged. This one arrived fine, well packaged for the trip. It cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous. It arrived when promised. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
yeayy I love this microwave it takes such a small space in my tiny kitchen but it is huge inside !! it has popcorn button as well !!
"during the kitchen remodel we decided to install a commercial type exhaust fan and eliminated the typical microwave location about the stove.  This thing is cool, push a button and the drawer opens, drop in your food, push another button and the drawer closes."
"Purchase was a good one.  Love the design of the microwave, and so far it meets all my needs.  Being short, the drawer is much more comfortable for me.  The process of ordering and receiving from Amazon was simple, efficient and has been one of the best purchases I've made in the whole kitchen reno project. Thanks Amazon."
Did the job. Great coverage. Made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new. Very satisfied.  Would purchase again
"So far, so good.  I have no complaints, but it's only been in use for about 6 months.  If I start noticing the same wear and tear (i.e. peeling paint on the interior), I'll post an update.  We use this appliance several times a day, everyday."
"This Kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year. Since tubes are now made in far east, instead of by Raytheon, quality as dropped, I now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it. It was nice to find a tube with diode (which has never failed) for such a great price."
This saved us from needing to buy a new microwave/ oven combo. Easy to use.  We used it to fix our microwave about 2 months ago and it's held up.
Very high quality product. This paint spayed right on with minimal dust and adhered right to the microwave for a smooth finish.
"I needed a small, compact microwave. This is perfect if you have limited counter space. The depth is good. It will hold a dinner plate but the interior height is shorter than a regular size microwave. This is because the controls are on the lower panel instead of on the side. The control buttons are simple but intuitive."
I ordered and it was very fast shipping about couple days.<br />My turntable engine was broken after 10 years used my microwave.<br />I'm very easy removed old engine and put new one.<br />Quality product and parts was new.<br />Highly recommended this seller.
"Love this little microwave! It is the perfect size (holds just a dinner plate) and LOVE that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room. We don't use it for much other than occasionally heating something up (1-2x month) or steaming vegetables, so I can't speak to how it does for heavy use."
"DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power.<br />&#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel.<br />&#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.  (This is the same principle as a pressure cooker).<br />&#62; Stir some oil (e.g., olive) oil with cut vegetables---a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces of vegetable.<br />&#62; A selection of glass casseroles of a range of sizes with glass lids can be essential for microwave cooking.

fits perfect and works great never thought I would find one that would fit my kitchen in stainless steel look
The poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch. This microwave has worked great for us. Very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space. I really like the one touch timer feature. It seems to be well built. Ours has a sticker inside that says built April 2013. I am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units.
This microwave works well and is efficient. It does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance. Would not hesitate to purchase again.
This little giant is great for small spaces. It is very easy to use and works just as well as larger microwaves. I am very happy with purchase.
"This kit is just what I needed.  My microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on.  I didn't want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove.  I got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install.  Now it works like new again.<br /><br />***There are dangers of electric shock, so do your research.***<br /><br />*Keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go.*"
When ordering cabinet for microwave I had no clue that Sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly.  It looks so great and works beautifully.
We got it the same day our cabinets were being installed. We were worried about it not working since this was our first on-line purchase of such a high priced item. Let me tell you how easy it went in and it performed FANTASTIC!!!! it is exactly what we wanted and the slide out drawer has our friends looking into how they can install one in their kitchens. We installed it in a bottom cabinet directly under the countertop. great height and so convenient to place hot items right onto the countertop. No more reaching over head or over a hot stove to get anything out. This is a real gem and an awesome addition to our kitchen.
"Bought this for a small kitchen, it fits nicely in the corner and works great. Seems to be well-made. Although it is lower wattage, I have not had to significantly increase the cooking time, and I can fit a plate or even cook/reheat in a round 2qt dish. The beep is a little loud but otherwise no complaints."
The ceiling of my microwave was a disaster. Paint was peeling all over it. This product did the trick. Make sure you sand properly and spray several light coats rather than one thick one.
Bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my RV.  I had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me.  The unit sits in one corner of the outdooor kitchen counter leaving me enough room to add a hot plate as well.<br /><br />Great item at a great price.  Enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks.
"I have just gone through 10 weeks of kitchen remodel that was supposed to take 5-6 weeks. I researched venting microwaves and found very good reports on this one. The availability and price here on Amazon beat my local big box stores and chains. Installation appeared easy for my contractors. There are options to allow venting outside, either behind or above the microwave (not so clear from product description) but we had planned to vent through filters as the only other option was through our garage (not compatible with local code).<br /><br />The bells and whistles are amazing, with our kids ready to show us how it works, right after we stop the clock blinking on our VCR."
"Had large amount of rust under rotating plate in GE microwave.  Surface prep is important.  I started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust I had.  I ended up using a 1&#34; metal paint scraper to remove all paint/rust down to base metal in the damaged area, this worked very well.  Then sanded smooth.  Wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol. Masked off area to be painted.  Ensure adequate ventilation when painting.  I applied mutliple coats.  2 months of usage thus far... looks great, holding up great!"
"It is so nice! it works, is small, has a wonderful shape, it is an acquisition for my kitchen. I recommend it."
After following the instructions it fixed my rusty microwave oven. I'm happy I had found this product. Now I don't have to pay a costly repair bill.
"I needed a microwave that would handle large dinner plates but took no space.  This item fits the bill perfectly.  It fits neatly into a corner of my countertop, in no way dominates the area, and functions way beyond what I expected.  If you are looking for a compact microwave that handles big things this is it.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.  Highly recommended."
"The microwave is light on features but works very well for the functions it provides.  It's a very simple micowave that does it's core job well which is exactly what I wanted.  I didn't need all of the advanced features, cooking presets and auto-options that the more expensive microwaves come with.  I installed the microwave in a couple hours removing the old one that didn't work anymore and had a bag of popcorn right after..."
i had where and tear on the bottom of my unit and paint pealing on the top. i brushes it down with a wire brush and put several coats of paint on it as directed. the product worked great. the inside of my microwave looks brand new.
"As advertised.  Easy to replace, Not really much more to say, bought a replacement part and it worked. Saved the money for a new microwave."
"GREAT SMALL SIZE, looks good, fits in a corner and does not take up a lot of apace, and works very well."
"have owned Sharps in past.  this fit perfectly above stove. No alterations, no fuss , Works great. looks great. would recomend"
I love it!  I have a small kitchen with limited counter space and this little microwave is exactly what I needed.  It works as well as any other microwave I have owned.  Very happy!
"I receive so many compliments about this cutie in our second kitchen. We have little counterspace in the area and this is worth every penny, works great, and a spectacular space saver. Highly recommended."
Fits very nicely in a corner spot and doesn't take up much room which is nice when you do not have much counterspace
this was exactly the one I needed I wasn't sure I would be able to find the one I needed but I did and loved the fact I received it sooner than expected
"fits in the corner under upper cabinets perfectly. Only 750 watts, but just fine for reheating left overs, etc.  I like that the &#34;controls&#34; are under the door, so that the turntable sits a little higher.  Also, something sitting in front of the microwave does not have to be moved before opening the microwave, as the door opens a few inches above the counter top.  I have only had the microwave for a month, but no problems at all.  I am very happy with my purchase."
"We were reluctant to spend so much on a microwave as we are not big microwave users but we absolutely love this and are glad we splurged. It defrosts without cooking, won't burn popcorn, can soften butter without melting, and of course looks amazing. Its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install.  If I had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages.  Still worth it and would still recommend it."
"I got this microwave yesterday and I've been smiling about it ever since. I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath."
Many more features than advertised. Reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product. It even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there's too much heat buid up.
"Great little microwave. It's the perfect size. It's a little underpowered, so a add 30 secs to most cooking times.<br />Small footprint and looks great in the kitchen."
"I got this to save counterspace and the fact I only use the microwave for reheating small meals and popcorn.  It performs these functions perfectly.  It may not have the most power but if another 30-60 seconds of reheating time is going to throw your day off, you have bigger problems than this microwave."
"I needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top, and I couldn't find anything smaller than a 0.7 Cu. Ft. in any store.  Since this one had so many good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter, but it is also the best microwave I've ever owned.  It fits regular sized dinner plates so it's the perfect size, and it heats up very quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen."
"This is perfect for one plate! It nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey, but honesty, who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave? This is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space! I got one for my mom, too, and she loves it! She finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space! My only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts (it's 750) just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes."
This is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen. The domed shape works great on my smaller counter top. Would recommend it!
"Love that it is off the counter, large, and works well.  I originally bought this microwave 6 years ago with absolutely no problems.  An electric failure in the house caused us to have to replace it, and without question, we bought the same one."
"A similar model that we got when we bought our home 6 years ago died and we needed the exact sized model to replace it because the old model was built into a non-adjustable shelve/frame above the counter top.  Searched websites and found what I wanted.  then searched Amazon and found one with the best price (@ Abe's of Maine)!  Quick delivery and the packaging/crating was extraordinary.  Would buy product again, and would buy from Abe's of Maine again!"
"I bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space.  This tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn't usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep.  It heats food very evenly and fits a full sized dinner plate in it.  Even if I eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen, I'd likely keep this microwave since it works so well."
I needed a little oven that fit in the corner.  For size and convenience it works well.  I have found that I need to leave what ever I am cooking in the oven a little bit longer.  But it works well and no complaints about operation.
"Fits perfectly in our countertop CORNER.  Fits in the &#34;dead space&#34; there.<br />It's on the small side, but it is perfect for our needs."
"Exactly what I wanted! It's the perfect fit. Works just fine... Bye bye bulky hand me down... I'm handing you down, lol"
"It met all my needs regarding space, looks like a TV, works well and you don't need a college degree to operate. Very pleased with this products. Little pricey but worth it."
"I like this microwave, it is small and uses very little space in my small kitchen, but it is powerful. It is a good combination of quality and good design. Expensive but worth it"
"Looks great, works great. Took less than an hour to install. Was a little overwhelmed with instructions, but was easier to install than originally thought. Looks great in my kitchen and has opened up so much space in my small kitchen. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
"Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.<br />I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that."
"From the moment I took it out of the box, it looked beautiful, fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great! I put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass. I did not want my old LARGE white microwave oven taking up one entire wall. I don't use the microwave that much, so this is perfect.  It's not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn AND you want style and beauty - this is it!"
"I purchased this microwave and and a more expensive model ($200+) from Williams-Sonomo and this Whirlpool is a much better machine. The build quality is excellent and the veritcal-ness of it saves space on the counter. Had to return the Williams-Sonoma model.  The Whirlpool is perfect for heating plates of food and leftovers in medium size bowls.<br />At first, I missed the numeric key pad on my old over the stove model but the small size of this models doesn't allow for the large pad. However,, after a short time you get used to pressing the start button to add time in increments of 30 seconds. Super product that I would buy again and it looks cool."
We love this microwave. It looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was. Our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything (including our largest dinner plates). Heating will require an additional 20-30 seconds but definitely worth the wait!!! Can't say enough about how cool it looks!
"I like the looks, the operation buttons on the bottom lends itself to a user friendly and a highly visible control panel. We have multiple Samsung products. All exceed our expectations of their products<br />There are NO other microwaves on the market with bottom eye level control buttons"
"Had to replace 5 microwaves in 5 years - 2 GE and 3 Samsung microwaves that cost much more died premature deaths at my house, vacation condo, and GF's house. Bought 2 of these so far and the first outlasted the 5. Hope to have the same luck with this one."
"Easy to install, user friendly instructions.  Came in good condition.  Manual very easy to understand and use micro/oven.  Cooks in 1/2 the time when using fast back.  Really good product."
"Love this microwave. Product was Easy to install, and easier to operate. The first one we ordered came damaged. The process to return item was a piece of cake. The second one came (from a different company) and was packaged much much better. We used to have our microwave sitting on the counter. We remodeled our 1950 galley kitchen and only had room for a drawer microwave. We will NEVER go back to any other microwave. Well worth the price..<br />Love, Love , Love this product"
This was the perfect microwave for my kitchen remodel.It is quite roomy. I particularly like the two stage fan and lighting features.
Install went well but retrofiting the exterior vent was a chore but thats not a problem of the unit. Only had it up and going for a short while but so far so good.
this is the best Microwave I have ever had.  Love the size and the program buttons.are so nice.<br /><br />I use the Bake Potato button all the time.
Thirty inch wide microwave ovens are a little hard to find. But that was the only thing I could use in the cabinetry in our Winnebago RV. It's much quieter than the one it replaced and seems to be more powerful too. We like it's added features oer the older unit we had. It decided to only run on high.
"As described by Phil, it is very easy to install.  A tip, as you cut the 4 small taps to get to the motor, put a small tool or wire in the door hole to keep in from falling inside the unit.  After you install the new motor, flip the door you cut out over, and the tab neatly fits the loop and the small screw hole lines up.  Use a small screw to attach the cut out door and it will be sealed from dust and dirt, as well as easily accessible if you ever need to open again."
I currently have one of these that fits perfectly in the space I have.  Bought this one again as a spare.  Just in case... and we know that case will come at the most inconvenient time.  Very happy with this 800W model.  Does my jobs.<br />  It is pretty good for my 1964 vintage wired house.  Too many things plugged in and too many watts required at the same time makes for too many trips to the fuse box.
"The Motor fit perfect, works great, price was excellent.<br />Was much cheaper than new microwave A A A A plus"
"I bought this for myself about 2 years age and liked it so much that I bought the same one for my sister. I like it very much. Its a perfect size, easy to use, has a button for baking potatoes and other items. I recommend it very highly."
"A very compact, beautiful and sleek microwave.  Saves a on counter space and will accommodate a full size dinner plate."
"Fits a cup of coffee, dinner plate and popcorn. What else do you need? Fits perfect in my cabinet out of site!"
"This product fit and worked as expected. For anyone wondering about how to install, there is a pattern of holes drilled in the bottom of the microwave around the turntable motor. To get to the motor, gently cut the metal between the holes to create a little door. Open the door, remove 2 screws then the motor, unplug old motor, plug in new one, drop new motor into hole, put 2 screws back. You're probably supposed to throw the &#34;door&#34; away but I bent mine back in there. Flip microwave over and plug it in, put turntable spindle back on and try it out. I recommend doing this out of sight of your spousal unit, and then take about 30 minutes to goof off. Then return microwave to spousal unit telling them what an arduous task it was but how you figured it out and saved the family $100.00. Should be good for at least a hug or a kiss or WHATEVER..."
This microwave works well. I wanted a microwave to heat my rice filled heating pad for my shoulders. It does that and doesn't take up too much space on the counter. I am very pleased.
"We love this new appliance.  Just a few days before Thanksgiving our old one died.  I purchased a new one locally and after installation realized the door hinges are placed where we could not open the door more than a few inches.  Returned that one and went online and found this one at almost $100.00 less than what my local dealer could get it for me.  He agreed that I should order thru Amazon and not only did I receive it in less than a week, it fit, looks great and works perfectly!"
"Simple to use, spacious, and compact. :)  Been looking for a microwave like this for a while.  The only drawback is it looks a bit like a old TV on the kitchen counter."
The microwave in our new house had corrosion and under the turntable. I sanded and cleaned for about an hour then sprayed this paint. I did have a little overspray but it turned out pretty well. There's a spot that looks like I didn't sand and clean well enough but there is plenty of paint left in the can to re-do it. It's good enough for now and the paint is holding up well after a month.
"I live in a small house (400 sf) so I don't have much room for anything. This may be too soon for a review (as I just received the microwave y'day) but so far it's just perfect. I love that the controls are on the bottom instead of on the side, as my microwave cubby is only 16.5 inches wide. I like the style and the easy setup, as well. It's perfect for an apartment, dorm room, or office kitchen.<br /><br />One thing to note - on the inside left wall (if you're facing the microwave), there's what looks like a cardboard panel screwed into the wall by the vent. There isn't anything definitive about what to do about this panel, and since it looks like it could possibly be removed, I called Whirlpool customer service to get some clarification. Long story short - don't remove the panel, it's supposed to be there.<br /><br />Other than that momentary confusion, I'm really happy with this product."
"Item was what was advertised, in condition advertised and delivered on time. That's all you can ask of a supplier. You must prepare the area where you are going to use the paint. Takes a lot of sanding and preparing, but the result of spraying even coats is great."
I bought this microwave almost a year ago. Love it. Quality is good enough ( I do not use it too often). I really in love with the design.
"This is a really nice little microwave!  Just what I was looking for.  No complaints.  It was shipped quickly by the supplier, too.  The controls are simple and elegant, and the surfaces are easy to clean.  I would buy it again."
So far so good. Replaced a Samsung and the existing bracket worked. Much quieter than the one replaced. My wife loves the<br />melt/soften function.
Motors turn at the correct speed and are powerful enough to power my project of a miniature barber pole and the price was good.
"This is the second Sharp R-1405, Over the Range Microwave I have owned. The first one lasted 8 years and gave me excellent service. So I was thrilled when I found the same model still being produced. I snatched it up and easily installed it because the same install hardware was required and 90% of the mounting hardware was already installed in the wall above the stove. Not only that..The price was about $200 or $300 less than comparable over the range microwaves. An excellent product that gets the job done!!...I highly recommend it!"
"For some strange reason, my microwave turntable plate just cracked in half.  I didn't have a part number so went by brand and size and found the perfect replacement through an Amazon vendor.  The order was shipped quickly and our microwave is usable again.  We are very happy and would recommend the vendor and product."
"When the turntable on my Sharp microwave stopped turning, I went on line to find a substitute.  Some years ago I had a turntable that worked independently of the microwave.  Simple device.  Works by winding it up, much like an old fashioned alarm clock.<br /><br />After Googling turntable, I came upon this little motor and thought &#34;Why not?&#34;, I can do this.  I know nothing about electronics, so I realized that by taking the microwave apart to make the fix, I might destroy it, but it wasn't working anyway so I decided to gamble and order the part.<br /><br />I very carefully opened up the microwave (after disconnecting it from the power) and located the motor that turned the turntable.  It was simple (fairly intuitive) to remove and replace, and for a very small amount of money, I fixed the microwave.  I've had this microwave for seven plus years and now I expect to get another seven, very possibly more.<br /><br />Overall...  one of my best buys on Amazon."
"Very attractive and functional microwave, that was easy to install as a replacement for a GE microwave that no longer worked."
"Needed a new stainless steel microwave. Works well, nice and big. It is only stainless on the front, black everywhere else. Works well so far..."
"This is an excellent product. It has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use. Its not only nice looking, but Consumer Reports rates it as one of the best. The stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any Kitchen decor."
"This is the third model of this microwave I have bought.  Since I do a lot of cooking with my microwave, I enjoy all the features this one has:  particularly, the &#34;baked potato&#34; and &#34;sensor reheat&#34; functions.  Not only was I overjoyed to find the exact model, I saved over $70 on my replacement!  I was also pleasantly surprised when it arrived three days after my order!"
"This Whirlpool WMC2005YW 0.5 cubic feet countertop microwave oven is the best microwave we have ever had. We sold our house, where we had a built-in micro, and moved into a condo 4 years ago and bought a small Haier. The only thing good about the Haier was,  it was small, so when it blew out we had to go small again. I totally counted on the reviews for this micro and, thank you everybody, you are so right! I got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute, just nestled into that small space. The best part is that it really works well. We feared making popcorn, which the Haier never, and I mean never, did well. Always burnt no matter what we tried. This Whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 1/2 minutes. We snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare. It will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly. There is a 30 second button, start, stop, and a clock that also doubles as a timer. We have never used the auto buttons. I would buy this again in a minute."
fits well on countertop in small space. Works very well warming and re-heating. Works better that other microwave that was much bigger.
"Everything is great!!! Just a warning!!!! Double check the template used for the upper cabinet. Actually check it against the unit. In my case I replaced an older Maytag, so I had two existing holes in my cabinet. Then added two more because of the template only to fine that they do not line up!!!!!! I superimposed the template over the unit and sure enough the holes did not line up!!! So I did not make a mistake!!!! The Template was off. No real big deal but now I have six holes.<br /><br />Double check the holes!!! Unit is great!! Previous unit did not vent out of the house. This one I installed a vent to the outside through the back and it has a really powerful motor. This Microwave gives you three options,Vent back,vent from the top or recirculate. I do not reccomend recirculating!!!! If you can vent this unit or any unit always vent!!!! I had some major issues venting this unit because of structural issues, like wires that I had to reroute etc but I knew that when it was over I would be smiling and I am!!!! For the price this unit works as good as any for much more money and the VENT is the Greatest!!!!!"
"My old microwave (dating back to the mid-90s) finally bit the dust.  I was worried that I wouldn't find another compact microwave to replace it, but this one fits the bill.  It is small, but big enough for the needs of our 3-person household.  I find height to be more limiting that width in microwaves, and this one offers about the same height as a regular one.  It's not as powerful as some of the full-sized microwaves, but an extra minute of waiting is worth it for the small footprint.  It's attractive although the buttons are not terribly intuitive.  The rounded back works well for our needs, as it nestles into the corner even better than our previous unit.  After a few months of use, I'm quite pleased with this purchase."
"I purchased this to replace a much larger microwave taking a lot of counter space.  Since we only use a microwave to reheat food and pop popcorn, this microwave is perfect.  I held off using it for several weeks because the inside wall of the microwave had a rectangle piece of cardboard screwed into the side with a metal and some plastic screws.  I removed the screws and cardboard but there were no instructions to tell me to remove it.  Once removed, there was a rectangle hole on the inside wall that was next to the turntable plate.  My old microwave didn't have an open space.  My concern was that if I heat soup, it could run over the bowl and spill inside this open space.  It still doesn't make sense to me because the cardboard couldn't have been meant to be left in since it can't be wiped down when cleaning the inside of the microwave.  Oh well, this mini micro works great and heats everything we need to the correct temp using the approximate times I used on my old microwave.  Yes, I'd purchase this again but I'll also be purchasing a rubber mat to place under it because it slides around when opening or closing the door."
"Very happy with this purchase. For the money, great product.<br /><br />I was a little concerned, because some had mentioned the clunky door, but I find no problems with it."
"I have a super small kitchen and this microwave fits perfectly inside. It works great and looks pretty cool.  I was hesitant about it fitting a large dinner plate but it does!!! So, it works for all my needs. Maybe the only downside is that you can basically only set it in 30 second intervals but that is normally the type of microwave cooking I do anyway so it's fine for me."
"We bought this microwave for our kitchen remodel partly because we also have this same unit in our motorhome.<br />The combination of an outside hood vent, range light, convection oven, and microwave made it a bargain as well.<br />The shipping was perfect. It was packed in 2 boxes, first the manufacture's styro lined box, then that box was bubble wrapped and boxed in a separate larger box.<br />The stainless steel matches our other appliances and looks great!<br />Thanks Sharp, Thanks Amazon"
"Everyone who visits my apartment always comments on how cool my microwave looks.  This powerful machine is perfect for the typical Manhattan kitchen.  If you are looking for a stylish, functional and space saving microwave - then buy this one!"
"I ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working. We wanted something small since we realized we don't use on much anymore except for frozen vegetables and reheating coffee. We needed a small microwave that would fit in a small area. This was the only corner model microwave I could find anywhere online. It is very cute and looks like an old-school television set. The controls are very simple, there is no number pad, you use the + and - minus signs to adjust cook time. This microwave also has a built in timer  which was also very nice. At only 750 watts, it seems to cook at the same rate as out old 1100 watt microwave.<br />Although the price was  higher that a comprable-sized microwave, the size and shape make it worth the extra money."
"I love this little microwave oven.  I just reheat food and cook some frozen dinners, so I wanted something that wasn't a counter space hog, was easy to open and easy to clean, and didn't have a lot of fancy options that I never use.  Previous reviewers have noted that the beep is loud when adding time, and that the seconds have to be added in 5 second increments (so there's a lot of pushing the + button), so I guess there's still room for improvement, but it does exactly what I want it to.  What I particularly like is the solid face without buttons sticking out of it.  Very easy to wipe clean, no worries about liquid getting into the circuitry."
"I love this microwave.  It is the perfect size for a small space, it looks nice, and it cooks well for a 750 watt.  The first one I received would not latch and Whirlpool took care of sending me a new one and picking up the old one, even though I did not purchase it directly from them."
"There is no brand name of the front of this appliance, which is nice because you can then pair it with your other appliances that may be a different brand. Which in my case was Whirlpool...just a note: Whirpool and Amana are one in the same.<br />I had it installed by a professional. I do not know if it was difficult to install. This is not a direct wire appliance, you will need an outlet in the cupboard above in order to plug it in.<br />So far no complaints. I have not had much time to use it...1 week since installation."
My wife wanted this item after conducting a great deal of internet research on it. I had been used to using a 10 year old microwave and did not think I would be that impressed with this new model. I was wrong. This is one of the best appliances that I've ever purchased.
"Absolutely love it! Takes up very little counter space - large inside, great height, would highly recommend. Purchesed for a cleaner counter look and that is exactly what i have. Many compliments from guests; everyone wants to know where they can order one."
"I don't find this microwave any noisier than others I've owned. I also find it very easy to use even without reading the instructions. So far it heats food evenly and is pretty powerful. Great basic, affordable microwave."
"Replaced an existing OTR microwave that had a burnt out magnetron. It's been several months since install, and I am still very happy.<br /><br />1) Carousel works.<br />2) Has a convenient 30 second or single button push for 1-9 minute intervals Can warm up small dishes or teas with the 30 second quickstart.<br />3) Nukes food up really quickly.<br />4) Very easy to install. Even with a old house, I used the printed template to drill guideholes and place in the retention frame. Took me two hours, and I was able to pop it in place all by myself.<br />5) Vent does a good job at sucking.<br /><br />Got it in fast, and in great condition. If you need a cheap replacement, this is it."
This is a great small microwave. It fits in a small area. Replaces an existing. This works much better. Do recommend
"Two days in and I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Small foot print, excellent build quality and yet holds a full size plate. It's also the quietest microwave I have ever owned. You can barely hear it. The LCD is super bright and the controls are so easy to use. I love how the entire front sure is flat - makes for really easy clean up. I would so buy this again and again."
"We bought this mainly because it had to be the same size as our old one, to fit into a space in our cabinets, and this was the closest. A bonus was the turntable, which my husband really likes.  It is larger inside than the old one, and more powerful, in the same space!  We have used it 4 months now with no issues at all.  The door does close and open rather hard, so we ease it closed, otherwise we love it! The controls are very easy to use.  We had a bit of trouble installing it, we could not get the bottom slots in the microwave  to slip onto the bracket, so we just bent the bottom of the bracket so the microwave sits on on it, and it is screwed to the cabinet from the top.  A good choice if it becomes available again."
Perfect replacement for my old one.  It is deeper than my old one but not to an extreme.  I can nuke larger items now.
"This is the first 1,200 watt microwave I've ever owned. It took just a while to figure out I didn't need things to heat as long, but once I figured it out, it is the best microwave I've ever owned. The only drawback I have is I wish the completed beeper was louder. Other than that, I am thoroughly satisfied with this microwave."
"Good quality product.  Installed well and works great.  Some reviewers commented on the way the door closes, but I have found it to be just fine.  Hopefully it will last a long time.  I would recommend.  3/2013 Update:  The microwave has worked flawlessly for the past year.  Very pleased with it.  With lots of use and much by teenagers, it has shown to be sturdy and solidly built thus far.  It also cooks very efficiently.  Still happy and would still recommend."
"This item works great, was pretty easy to install and matches our kitchen. Exactly what it says in the description, arrived on time. We have no complaints whatsoever with this item. I would definitely recommend it!"
"Wow, Wow, Wow! I was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet, but how great it was. I was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well. The price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated. I had it install the same day and I am very happy about this product and the overall purchase. I know you will too."
"The first time I used it, I was disappointed with it, but I don't know if it just got better, or if I pushed the wrong button the first time because it's been great since. Nice and roomy interior, easy to install (I did it completely by myself, though I recommend you have a friend). I did forget to change the fan so that it vented up at first, so I had to take it down to do that, but once you get the frame mounted on the wall, that part is easy. The hardest part was mounting it to the cabinet above... I'm not sure how they could have made it any easier though, the problem is mostly a matter of physics.    I would recommend this to anyone needing a decent power microwave to go over their range."
The GE Profile countertop microwave 2.2 cu.ft. is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items.  Very satisfied with our purchase.
Great product.  Fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm.  Sleek and effective!
this microwave is incredible!  very quiet and the convenience of a drawer is great!  easy to use and to clean!
"My Sharp drawer microwave is so much more than I even hoped for.  It is convenient.  The button to open and button to close OR easy pull to open or easy nudge to close and it finishes opening or closing by itself!  Love that!  I had to REPROGRAM myself to go easy to get it opening or closing, then let it finish all by itself.  I was impatient because it takes 2 seconds rather than 1/2 second that I used on my previous microwave to jerk it open or slam it shut.  It's good for me to slow down for 2 seconds!  There are more single cook options than I have used yet. I really like the push START once to get one minute cook time, 2 pushes for 2 minutes, etc.  Can do the same to add a minute while cooking.  SENSOR REHEAT and SENSOR COOK buttons are useful, but as in prior microwaves, I have to still keep a check on how it's cooking.  It seems to cook evenly, but I probably will get a windup turntable if I can still find one.    It holds a 9x13 pan with room to spare.  The 1000W power cooks fast.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!"
"After our old Microwave died we started searching the market online and in stores.  I purchased Consumer Reports for microwaves and then searched for them on Amazon to read the customer reviews.  The top ten rated had horrible customer reviews.  So then decided to search from the bottom of the list up, and this is when I found our next microwave.  Loud was the only beef with this microwave.  Now in our house loud with all our kids is nothing compared to a microwave.  Basically if your trying to sleep near by this microwave then maybe it would seem loud.  But the 1200 watts cooks everything super fast, even heat with the turning tray is awesome!  This is used several times a day and after a month no complaints!"
My husband & I were looking for a microwave for my daughter & her husband for a Christmas gift.  This is the same brand that we have & are very happy w/ it.  This is exactly what we were looking for & so happy to find it @ such a reasonable price.  Their home is nearing completion & they are so excited to install this microwave & start using it.  Our daughter said that she just loves the modern look & knows that it'll look wonderful w/ all their other stainless steal appliances.
We've owner this product for several years now.  It looks nice and works great.  Amazon handles the shipping of this heavy product with ease so you don't need  to be concerned about it getting to you in top condition.
"We have had this microwave for about a month and absolutely love it!  Well worth the price.  It is super convenient, you can see and stir the food without removing it from the oven.  Cooks evenly and quickly.  Easy to use and clean. Very attractive, a conversation piece as well."
After owning a previous Sharp microwave/convection oven I bought this one.  Installed 5 years ago and still just as pleased as the day it was installed.  Excellent even microwave and oven performance.  Highly recommend this product.
"Excellent price and product (2 day shipping with Amazon Prime - another really good investment!). This has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a Sears Kenmore over the range microwave - which was useless from day one. It fits well, very secure mounts and easy to use template. Oven itself is easy to use, quiet, powerful, excellent venting (in our case out the top - to the roof). Everything has been easy to clean so far (including the buttons and window). I put it in myself - but two person job would have been a better choice. Really like the sensor cooking (so I don't have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time...). Definitely recommend this oven."
THIS IS AWESOME! LOVE IT! IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL! COOKING AND DEFROSTING IS VERY WELL! AND THE SHIPPING WAS EARLY! VERY HAPPY OVERALL!
"The Microwave works beautifully.  The installation instructions left something to be desired, but we figured it out."
This black LG over-the-range microwave is just what we needed!  It arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly.    We're happy customers!
This Sharp Microwave is Great for a Family. Its Large size is a big plus.  Easy operation and nice finish and very powerful.   We had an LG oven before and it is a JUNK ! It lasted only 2 years.  Our old Microwave was a Sharp also and its still working after 20+ years!  My rating A+++
"This microwave is wonderful. The quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use. If you read Consumer Reports, it says this (or similiar) microwave has only a useful space of 0.9 cubic feet. Not so. This has a full 2.0 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish. Very sharp design, useful and adequate lighting underneath. For the installation/do-it-yourselfers: It's 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove. Follow the instructions to the letter, and all will turn out great. The directions are very good. Note: If you can, remove your stove before installing the microwave. The mfgr doesn't mention this, but it made things a lot easier (and I got to clean under it!)...2-3(-3 preferred) people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size. I recommend this microwave highly!"
This appliance works much better than my last sharp. As for noise complaint I didn't find it to much different than my old microwave. Only bad part about stainless steel is that you see all the fingerprints everywhere. Really liked the speedy service.
"After too much research, I settled on this terrific microwave.  Every brand of microwave seems to have a malfunction-no help horror story. So in the end, if you chance having a microwave at all, this one seems better than most, if not all.  It works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts. My experience with Sharp Carousels has been 5 stars.  At home and work they have been dependable, efficient, good looking, and inexpensive.  Both the 2.0 and 1.4 cubic foot Carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles. When I designed my kitchen twenty years ago, I made two below-counter cabinet spaces to tuck in a medium and a large countertop microwave. I bought Carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily.  They have been great workhorses.  The smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago, then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture. Last year I bought new stainless steel appliances (including Bosch dual fuel slide-in range-- the dream machine), and so I chose the stainless steel Sharp R-408LS Carousel 1.4 cubic foot/1100-W with a 14 inch turntable from BJ's ($99) as a replacement. The match with the other appliances was so good that I replaced the 2 cubic foot/1200-W with Sharp's R-520KS microwave as well. The display pads are lightly different, but better than losing size in the 1.4 cu. ft.  The Carousels match the Bosch oven door design remarkably, including the rounded window corners.  My kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition. Knowing that these two new appliances are untried in the long term, I can only say they are 5+ stars as week-old additions to my kitchen. The microwaves do everything I want powerfully and quickly. The cost, especially with Amazon Prime shipping, closed the deal."
"For the price I don't think you can beat this Sharp microwave.  I just wanted a basic microwave that did the job.  I was replacing a countertop micro that was rated at 1200 watts and I was concerned that the rated 950 watts of the Sharp would be inadequate.  My fears were groundless as the Sharp functions every bit as fast the older one.  I like the sleek appearance without a protruding door handle.  They recommend two people to mount this oven, however since I didn't have help available I was able to easily mount it myself with a little thought.  If I were to rate it down for anything it would be that the mounting instructions are confusing in a couple of areas, mainly in the venting info.  All-in-all a good buy."
"I bought the Sharp R-520KS Microwave to replace my old White Westinghouse that stopped working after Thanksgiving.  I did alot of research before I bought this one.  I was worried I wouldn't find a microwave that worked as well as my last one.  The good thing is that I could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house.  Now I had an excuse to replace it.  I was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in, and this one had some of the best reviews, a decent price, and the stainless steel look I wanted.  I also needed a counter top model since I have no under cabinet space to put one.  This microwave works great!  I also like how the control panel doesn't have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons.  It has some nice features like the hot water button (you tell it how many cups to heat), minute plus button, keep warm setting, and many others.  I've probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most.  There are sensor heating buttons, reheat buttons, and defrost buttons, although I haven't had a chance to use them as much yet.  The ones I have used so far work great!  My only minor complaint is the same as everyone else's, the buttons all look the same and the start/minute plus button and stop/cancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly.  Not too much of an issue, but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others.  It wouldn't keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and I'm sure I'll get used to them soon.  The microwave is also pretty large, so you can fit alot in there.  I've heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time.  All in all, this microwave works great, looks great, and was reasonablypriced.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice looking, powerful, counter top microwave."
this was a great buy!! I read the other reviews and they are right on the money. Easy to put up but it goes easer with two people but one can do it and everything you need is their and it works great.
Love it! Love it! Love it!  My Sharp microwave of 10 years finally died.  It had survived numerous moves and the door was actually held on by strapping tape.  We looked around at other microwaves and found we couldn't beat the price for all the features offered by this model from.  This one was built with the same quality as my old one and I don't doubt it will last as long.
"We really like this microwave but more we like how easy it was to get it from Amazon.  It really has a good convection oven, although is somewhat noisy with the fan.  It was very easy to install and came with very clear instructions.  Amazon delivered it quickly and it was the best price as anywhere."
"This is a great microwave, especially with the $25 discount Amazon is offering on kitchen purchases over $125. But let me tell you why this purchase was extra special. I was concerned about buying a microwave that had to be delivered (size, weight, fragile, etc) rather than from a local store .  But the selection at local stores like Best Buy was so bad, I placed the order. Unfortunately, the day it was supposedly delivered by UPS, no microwave arrived. I called UPS to see if I could start a tracer, but UPS told me that Amazon had to start the tracer because they sent the package. I went to the customer service site, couldn't find a phone number, and used the e-mail system. I thought - great - that e-mail will disappear into the ether, I may never hear from anybody, and here I am without my microwave.  That was about 8pm local time when I sent the e-mail. <br /> <br />The next morning when I checked my e-mail, I got quite a surprise. An Amazon rep wrote back, apologized my package had been lost, and re-ordered the item for me. Before too long, I had an e-mail the item was already shipping via 2-day delivery, and sure enough, 2 days later I had the replacement package. Wow! No hassle, no waiting, just great service. I couldn't believe it. I don't think I'll ever hesitate when I want to order something from Amazon again. I don't work for Amazon, they're not paying for this - I've actually never written a product review before. I was just so impressed with the customer service, I had to write. <br /> <br />The final chapter - the day before the replacement microwave arrived, the person who lives in the next cul-de-sac over from us, with the same house number, and with a street name similar to ours, showed up with the original microwave that UPS had mistakenly delivered to them. I wrote Amazon customer service an e-mail, and once again after a very quick response, I was able to arrange for UPS to come pick up the extra package.  Thanks Amazon.  You're great."
"I bought this on Amazon to replace a Sharp microwave, which has served me well for several years. Based on the price, compared to other with similar features, this unit is the least expensive. I was also impressed with the comprehensive directions for installation. I am closer to being Tim (the toolman) Taylor than a professional at home improvements, so I followed the instructions with precision. The results were outstanding. Not only does it look GREAT where my old stove hood used to be, it passed my popcorn test, of which, I am particular. No scotching, full bag, satisfying and an extra plus, while I am beaming over my accomplishment, the beep sounds indicating the popcorn was finished, the display read Enjoy. Am I ever! I have in my digital locker,courtesy of Amazon, my own .pdf manual. What a great investment in money for the microwave and the time for installation of the unit.<br /><br />Solidly built, looks great, came with lightbulbs for range light INSTALLED! No cons, but could have used some help with installing, as the manual recommends 2 people install, but I did manage nicely by myself. I would suggest an additional set of hands for final insertion, once preparations are complete. I have only owned this for a day, but, I wanted to tell my tale to give others an incentive, if they are on the edge, to jump at this opprotunity to snazz up the kitchen in a big way and for little out of pocket.<br /><br />Panasonic wants like $300 for a comparable unit. I am pleased to pay 1/2 as much and get a quality unit such as this. You can even get this for $25 off before January 31st, free shipping (this dude is HEAVY!) and no tax, do the math, it is a steal!"
A gift for a newborn baby.

I just recently ordered and received this for my son and he loves it. I wish I would have known about these 2 months ago when he was born.
The only binky my newborn will use. Have stocked up on this!
Our newborn loves these and won't use our other brands we have
Just like the one in the hospital!
My baby loves her caterpillar WubbaNub...she actually likes sucking on the little legs.

My son loves this! And my husband loves that it's a dragon.
These rock! Glow in the dark pacifiers are the way to go. If you don't  have any you should try them. No more turning the light on to find it.
My baby loves it

Saw this on shark tank and ordered before episode was over! Haven't actually used it bc my baby is still a newborn but can't wait!
My baby is strictly breast fed and would not take any pacifier. We tried every type out there but she loves this one
My boy will only suck a mam. We would be lost without them!
My baby prefers this style pacifier. Would recommend.
My baby can't fall asleep without these soothies. Must have for your little one!
Seems like there's a wipe for everything these days!
"I luved it thankz a lot...,"

"Got one of these as a freebie when I was pregnant. Unfortunately, it was clear and got lost easily. These stand out awesomely no matter where it falls and my son loves them!"
My grandson loves these
Love this pacifier. When I wahed it for the first time the fabric on the belly and feet faded to white :(
"Love these. I have been trying to find pacifiers that don't hold the soap bubbles and water after washing. These do a little bit, but not as bad as the Nuks. The Nuks and these are the only ones we can get our son to take right now."
just what we were looking for.
love it now my mom has a base for her car.
"these bags are awesome. i keep them on the changing table and use them for soiled diapers. i used to use the diaper genie, but i hated leaving smelly diapers in the room until the container was filled. this way i just throw the diapers away as they are used.  i also keep them in my diaper bag. i've used them numerous times for wet or dirty clothes"
bought it as a gag gift for christmas. it came in early and the product worked as expected.
this item is made of really thick and sturdy material. i used it on the edge of a wooden bed. the tape provided with the product is sturdy and keeps the protector snug and tight. it is difficult for the kids to pull it out.<br />i think the item works well for what it is advertised for. i like the build quality and is not cheaply made. a must have if you especially have 2 kids as they are always running around and pushing each other.
as expected
My daughter loves it.
Only pacifier my baby would take we tried them all!
thank you!
i  it!
practical product.
My daughter loves this color!
My baby with four months Loves This pacifier.
Just a described and received when promised.
A life saver!
Baby loves them and the glow in the dark makes them (slightly) easier to find.
My son loves it!
"these were recommended by our eating therapist to help my 8 month old move his tongue when he eats. we love them, too bad they are discontinued."
They are the 0-3 months just in case you were wondering
These were real life savers during last few months
traditional game
Son loves these soothies. We try to only give him the pacifier when he is so mad that we can't calm him down with walking/rocking/songs etc...
My grandson loves it. I like cows so he had to have it.
Binky arrive ahead of time. They are as described  .
excelente!!!
my little monkey finally got his first cold so i got to see this bad boy in action.. well it works.. and he hates it!!!  but it works so much better then the bulb.. its deff a pump sucking kinda thing.. i cant explain it.. anyway i never added tissue and i also never got sick as some said.. but it was just a cold..
excelente!!!
Product as described
it was a gift
works well
"i love these bags. they are thick and freeze well. as long as they are fully closed, they do not leak. thawing milk is easy in these too and they keep the milk fresh. i hated the l bags, i felt they were too thin and flimsy so i tried these and haven't looked back since."
i already have one but bought a second for our second changing area. you don't realize how well these work until you try using a regular trash can for a diaper garbage.
he loves it....
lies flat and baby loves it.
my baby loves these! can always find her paci in crib at night. helps to self soothe so we don't have to get up and find it for her. even when she is not sucking on it she cuddles w it. we have two. we also stick in freezer for her teething.
must have for nursing moms!!!!
"i done research for many days before buying this seat protector. i have leather seats and wanted to be very careful to not ruin them from the car seat base or car seat protector. this one is made very well and had nothing on the bottom that would hurt my seats. i highly recommend it, but it did not work for me. unfortunately it does not fit my 2015 jeep patriot seats correctly. my base is bigger than the seat protector."
Baby loves!
my daughter loves this type
worked well with my cybex aton 2 car seat.
my teething daughter loves these!
bowls arrived on time and as pictured
"carters is a quality brand. bought these as a shower gift. with a newborn, one can never have enough lap pads !!"
fits on my bob and works as expected!
The only ones my son will use!
We have several of these.  The baby loves them!
no more smelly itchy backside
It's a stache.  It even comes with a custom cover. Baby likes it. Mom and I dig it.
"my grandson loves this book, one of his favorites at the moment"
"bought this for my daughter's family, they are expecting their second child.  she loves it!"
works as expected.
we bought this to protect our leather from the indentations of the car seat. it does seem disperse the weight well and when removing compression marks fade withing the hour.
product of exelente quality product
Worked like a charm.  Just what he needed.
"i use these gates to block off the upstairs from the downstairs to keep my dogs seperated. one gate goes at the base of the stairs, and the other at the top. so far, i havent had any issues with the dogs knocking them over (i have one 80 lbs. pitbull, another 50 lbs. pit mix and a 12 lbs. jack russel). the only down side to these gates is that there is no door to bypass the gate through, so any time you would like to get past the gate, you either have to manuever over it or un-do the latch. i dont mind this though because i think that a gate with an accessible door would be less sturdy. we marked our latch spot with a permanent marker for quicker set-up."
she loves it! !!
she loves this still!
instructions are a bit difficult but it's doable. love the color and the crib.
Excelente
same as used in the hospitals
Baby loves them!
Picture doesn't do it justice
Only ones my twins will take!
100%
These are the only pacifier my son will use.  He prefers the shape of these orthodontic nipples to the round ones.  I should note that the picture on the front of the pacifiers is starting to wear off after 2 years.
My son loves it. It's easier for him to keep in his mouth since he has a cleft.
They work quite well and come in colors for boys or girls
EXCELENT
These binkys are smaller and don't leave marks on baby's face like the larger ones do.
Just what we needed
After trying 3 pacifier without any luck finally I found one that my baby like.
Baby only likes MAM
Baby loves this. Snuggles with kitty and can now put pacifier in and out of mouth without help!
excelente
keep ordering these for 5 years now ...
haven't personally used it myself but my granddaughter seems to like it!
great!<br />buckle at the top.<br />elastic and buckle on the bottom.

"this thing is a savior with potty training kids. i keep it in my car or &#34;diaper&#34; bag of i'm carrying one. whenever my 3.5 year olds need to go they don't have to touch the icky public toilet, or have me attempt to hold them over the toilet.<br />we also take long car trips frequently, having the potette makes it easy to stop anywhere. once you run out of the bags it comes with you can just use grocery bags (check them for holes first!).<br />our final use for this was while camping.  instead of walking half a mile to the restroom facilities i could just set this up and put a bag in.<br /><br />the legs on it are quite short, it doesn't bother my kids because they are small for their age.  if you have a taller kid than mine it may get awkward, but i'd think it's better than trying to squat."
My house has a love hate relationship we these things. My kid loves them and I hate them. I really need to get rid of them cold turkey. Keeps the kid happy when he sleeps.
What can we say?  It's a Wubbanub. It's literally the only thing that motivates my child to behave.
My baby loves it
My son loves these pacifiers!
My son loves these!
My baby boy loves these pacifiers! They were the easiest ones for him to keep in his mouth and to find in his crib. He's never looked back!
he will only take this kindf. Thank you for carrying them
My sons got to have his Wubbanub everywhere we go .
My son loves these pacifiers!
Baby loves it
My baby prefers these over teethers!
This is hysterical and looks so cute on my nephew. got quickly
My baby loves her pacifier she loves cuddling with the girafee
"My son doesn't like any of the soother, this one? He likes the monkey, and he keeps biting it! As long as he likes it!"
Our daughter loves them
"go to baby gift, everyone loves them!"
My 1yo uses pacifiers for nap time but for some reason won't graduate past the 0-3mo size.
granddaughter loves it.
worked like a charm! only needed 1 extender.

"Baby playing with it,but she have never used it"
"I was skeptical about purchasing this because you can buy 6 of these pacifiers for the price of this one on a cat. My daughter loves the soothie pacifiers but those dang things disappear so fast because they bounce and roll. With the wubbanub I no longer have to worry about lost pacifiers, my daughter loves playing with it and if the pacifier isnt in her mouth usually one of its legs are. Overall I think it was worth it because it keeps track of the pacifier for me, it keeps the pacifier in place and it also gives my daugther something to entertain herself with. I actually ended up ordering another."
these seem to work well for our little guy and he wears them without complaint!
"cutest, awesomest wall decor ever!!!"
a gift
My daughter is 18 months old and still loves her &#34;froggie&#34;! She's been using it since she was a few months old. I had to get another one as a backup when the other one needed to be cleaned.
This is similar to the hospital brand!
This is a lifesaver; especially during the newborn stages. It keeps the pacifier in place and keeps you from searching for lost pacifiers!
"These are the only kind my newborn will take. Unfortunately we ended up getting the pink pack for our baby boy since you don't get to pick the color, but for around the house they'll work."
This is the only brand my daughter loves. Came through in the clutch for me. Thank you.
Glow in the dark pacifiers are the only ones we use at night because they are so much harder to lose!
The only pacis my daughter will take!
The only pacifier my son will take!
EXCELENTE
Son loves these!
Bought for a gift for baby shower in June.
Bien bien
Helps my daughter keep her pacifier in hermouth. HHopefully she does it herself soon.
These are the only pacifiers my ebf son will take.

THANK YOU.
My grandson loves it!
Baby loves it!
This was the only paci one of my kids would take. Just had another little one a few days ago and he has already taken to this with zero issues
It arrived the next day.  My grandson loves it.
Mom to be was excited to have these glow in dark pacifiers.  Baby not here yet so not sure how well they are working out for her.
These are the only nuks that our daughter will take.
Our granddaughter just loves this thing!
"my 1 year old daughter has been wearing this all winter. our house drops to about 62 degrees at night, and she is very comfortable sleeping with this and fleece feety pajamas. she's had a few accidents (and a noseblood... and a vomiting incident.. being a parent is so much fun!) and it has laundered very well. the zipper tucks up nicely in the little cloth slot, and it's actually very possible that she'll still fit in it next winter when she's 2.5 - she's a slightly above average height, average weight toddler.<br /><br />it might just be a coincidence, but she was having horrific sleep problems before we bought this, and she's been mostly sleeping through the night ever since. it breaks my heart to think that she might have been cold that whole time and our last double-pjs + blanket weren't sufficient... but who really knows.<br /><br />if you live in a cold, drafty farmhouse and you turn the heat down at night, this is the sleeping bag to get for your toddler. you won't be sorry!"
would not leave home without it!
thank you
"My baby loves these MAM pacifiers, and the glow in the dark helps us find them and pop them back in!!"
"My son loves these, not a fan of the Chicco or smoothies, but loves these."

We've tried a lot of pacifiers -- these are the one my son loves.  He is now 8 months and still likes em.
My Granddaughter loves these!!
Our baby likes these!
Son loves it!
Keeps paci's in tight!
cutest pacifier ever!!
This is the only pacifier my twins use!
"My son is fed via a combination of breastfeeding and pumped milk. We've tried A LOT of bottles and he prefers the MAMs over everything else. For him, the nipples on Dr. Browns and Born free are too long. He hated the Avent Naturals because he had to smoosh his face into them to get a full latch. He is OK with Nuks but he prefers the MAMs. I think that the shape of the nipple just really works for him. It is wider and flatter than most bottle nipples. They say it mimics the breast - that isn't our issue as I use a nipple shield. He also seems to have less gas, due to the venting system. That all said, it is true that these can leak from the base if you don't assemble them correctly. It has happened to me, I know now to double check the base before I pour milk in. In addition, the venting system in designed in such a way that if you heat up milk directly in these by putting a bottle in warm water, you'll get water in the underside that will drip out when feeding. Since the plastic is fairly thick on these, I just heat up the milk in a Medela bottle and transfer to one of these to feed."
But it came with a little hole that I ended up sewing
We lost one of these and this is a replacement. My granddaughter loves it!
pefrect
yay! finally something that worked for us to put a gate up at bottom of stairs!
Item was as pictured - the pacifier pack with birds on it.
My son loves these pacifier's!
My son loves these!
Excelent Quality
"Was what we used when our daughter was newborn up to 3 months, then transitioned her to Nuk brand. With the Avent soothies we did not have nipple confusion. She did have a hard time keeping it in her mouth though, so they seem slightly heavy."
Daughter loves them!
my son loves this blanket.
Baby's fave!
Baby likes them.
I love these pacifiers. Too bad my baby doesn't like any pacifiers at the moment.
My daughter loves this binky!!
My baby boy will only take these pacifiers.

excelente!
this was a gift and the couple who received it like it alot.
love the item  hate the fact it was 3 days late
i wish the directions were a little clearer but it wasn't hard to put together once i figured out the tiny diagram.
"the product came to me well and on time, without any problem, i'm already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend."
My daughter loves Wubbanub period! She holds them close for security and when she's awake she holds onto the pacifier and plays with it.
My son loves his wubbanub I'm going to order another one for back up
Roll big green!
they work as designed and stop my son from ruining the back of the seat in front of him while sitting in his car seat.
excelente!
I brought these for my grandson. I guess its a matter of preference. He likes them over the other ones his mom brought. They are small enough to fill his mouth without him straining to get a grasp on it.
"In addition to pacifier wipes, I used these for quick cleanup on breast pump parts.  Basically the same thing as the cleaning wipes that are sold specifically for pumps, but they are smaller so they last longer  they are also much less expensive!"
As described.
just what I wanted
He likes it.
My daughter loves these.
As expected

My kid likes hugging the monkey.

"the nipples don't collapse, there aren't a million pieces, and they don't leak. everything i need.! note: if the nipples do start to collapse, it's because the little vent has gotten stuck or sealed. simply pinch it from the inside and that fixes the problem. also, i once had the experience where the milk was coming out way too fast. this was because the vent had been turned inside out during cleaning and hadn't popped completely back into place. once i got the little vent to it's proper position, the problem was resolved"
"finally! of all the random products i have not cared too much about over the years, bibs have been a cause of annoyance for me! the cloth ones stain, and some of the &#34;waterproof&#34; ones start to smell moldy after a little. i tried the baby bjorn ones, but those were so stiff they felt like body armor. these are soft silicone, so they sit comfortably on my toddler and they roll up easily to go in the diaper bag. i simply rinse it after use or use a napkin to wipe it down. the pocket is absolutely essential and catches food and milk with every meal. my only complaint is that it doesn't quite get tight enough around the neck, so sometimes food will still dirty her collar. also, the clasps sometimes come undone while she is eating."
thumbs up
"Seriously, I probably spent a fortune on these because my baby hated having a tether on them and these suckers can roll. It's quite amazing how far they can end up and in completely different directions then they initially bounced off in."
My son loves it. It's really hard to find pacifiers for 2+ years old
Holds up to the dishwasher well! Our little one loves them.
"Yup, it's a mustache and a pacifier, works as advertised."
Baby loves it
every baby loves these
My son loves this giraffe pacifier. It is one of his favorites and we have been through a lot of them.
only thing that has worked for my 9 month old. overnight diapers leaked. sizing up leaked. double diapers leaked. pull-ups over regular diaper leaked. we put this inside a regular diaper and it works! we do fold it in half and put it in the front since she is a tummy sleeper.
"this bathtub absolutely saved our sanity as first time parents.<br />our daughter hated bath time and we were always afraid that we were getting the water too hot, turns out we were getting it too cold!<br />she loves bath time now and we couldn't be happier.<br />it was an instant success.<br />i will be purchasing these again in the future for baby shower gifts."
received as promised!!
my baby girl loves them
The only binkys my daughter will take.
My daughter loves these.
These little friends will save your life at 2 in the morning when your daughter/son cannot find their Pacifier...Wash well..very durable...
I grandson just loves it!!
Our son has had his Pandu for 5 years (without the pacifier of course!) and it's become his lovey and part of the family.
These are my grandson's favorites.
"We purchased the Elephant at the same time as the Giraffe, and our baby loves his Wubbanub! Because the stuffed animal keeps the pacifier centered and stable, if he loses it from his mouth, it stays reachable for him to find easily. For a fussy baby, this is a game changer!"
Everything Ok.
Even cuter than the photo!
Part of a baby gift that was in response to invitations that was monkey-themed. A hit at the shower.  Score!
Bought as a gift.
Thank you!

"we had owned the city mini single in 2011, and three children later upgraded to this bad boy. we adore this stroller. it fits our 3 1/2 year old and 2 year old on one side sitting together so it's plenty deep. easy to navigate, a little harder to close up compared to the single city mini, but still easier than every other stroller. highly recommend!"
standard tray.
gud
Only ones my daughter will use.
"Love these pacifiers... unlike some of the ones that are specially shaped for orthodontic reasons (such as Nuk), these ones are the same at any orientation, which makes it easy for a baby to put it back in his/her mouth. I tried another brand, and it was frustrating for my child because she would sometimes put it back in upside down. With this one, it's impossible to do that!"
Only pacifiers my son will take.
Baby loves it.
my baby loves this puppy
came just as advertised.  My son loves his monkey and his dog.  Wouldn't take any other type of pacifier.  He is always carrying it around by the monkey/tail.  Have had no problems with these for the past 11 months and he still loves them.
Was well made and &#34;baby safe&#34;.  Met expectations.
This is the only binky my son will use!
The only pacifier that she can keep in her mouth!
My son LOVES his WubbaNub's.  He'll spot it across the room & come running for it.
My second gift for my Grandson

My son loves these
Exelent!
The pacifier good-looking
"Mam is our favorite brand for pacifiers and bottles! Something about the high-quality material and shape of nipples makes them great. The glow in the dark aspect of these are the best - I'm nearly blind without contacts, so searching for a paci in the dark while being blind is a bad combo. I can see these bad boys glowing from a few feet away, making them easy to grab and pop back in baby's mouth."
You simply cannot see a kid with any of these and not laugh - cannot be done.  Got these for the granddaughter and getting a picture simply cannot go unshared.
My son loves it
description of product is just what I was looking for.
Works well!
Bueno

"Worth the money if your baby uses these pacifiers! Without the wubbanub, my baby would spit her paci out and I would have to chase it down, wash it off every few minutes!"
When my neighbor showed up with a pink pacifier I knew I couldn't be outdone with my lil girl. I immediately signed on to amazon & furiously searched for a pink pacifier. This thing didn't fail me @ all! It's so pink & suckable my baby is hip!
a+
i ordered this the other day and so far so good. the only thing i strongly dislike about this item is how hard it is to out together when you're alone.  worst 4 hours of my life.
only bottle my son will take!
my daughter played with these when she was a baby all the time.  can be used for different purposes from toy to hanging things on her pram.
a must if your baby is petite.
my daughter loves it!
i wish that holister would keep making the soco!
this is great for cold weather! kept our little one cozy while walking the streets of nyc.
My son loves this! He wasn't holding a paci in his mouth well but these helped a ton!
These are the only pacifiers my breastfed baby well take. He simply loves them. I wish I could find them locally.

"easy to use, fits car seat with base"

This pacifier was a life-saver. My daughter loves it and it's less likely to fall out of the crib.
Not sure why but my daughter would not use any other pacifier but this one.

We tried about six other different (more expensive!) brands and yet these are the only pacifiers my 6 month old will take. Such a lifesaver in long car rides!
My kid loves it!
Wubbanubs have been a blessing for us. I can find his pacifier now. No digging in a car seat or losing it in the car.
If yoou know a baby this is a must
She loves them.
Muy bueno<br /><br />Gracias !!
Expensive and baby hated it. But was shipped fast and was exactly what I ordered.

No problems whatsoever!
I've used nuk pacis for my son and will do again for my soon to be baby girl.
My daughters both hated Dummys (Paci's) and never took them. I bought this pack for my 4 month old to chew on which she loves to do but never sucks on them . They are thicker than the 0+ ones that we got from the hospital. I am breastfeeding and these are the closest thing to a nipple.
just buy
Roll Tide!
Grandson loves them and like the color.
Never can have enough of these.
"My son loves it, he also has the lion one."
Bought this for my must have everything Giraffe daughter.  She displays it prodly will all her other Giraffe paraphernalia.
This was the only binky my baby would use. I have no idea why he loved it so much but I tried several others and he rejected them all. The only bad thing is they are hard to find.
Just a replacement.  Baby loves her &#34;grenouille&#34;.
My baby loves this!

"Our baby loves these, third one we purchased"
Little guy loves them!

Only ones my baby likes!
My newborn has been picky with pacifiers.  She LOVES these and we have tried every brand.
"We had the dragon one of these but my little one bit the end of the paci off and he doesn't sleep with out it. :( so we got a new one, the monkey. It's very soft, much softer than the dragon was. My little one seems to love it just as much as the dragon. They are machine washable and can be dryed on low heat."
My Son loves this thing. It is a life savor and it helps me keep the pacifier in his mouth.
"As advertised, my daughter just didn't like them"
My son loves them
My son loves this guy.  He uses it every nigh to go to sleep.  Its also cute. I have nothing bad to say.
My daughter loves these and this was the only place I could find them
cute...bought for shower present....
Thank you!
Only pacis my daughter will take.
much smaller than it appears in pictures....disappointed
excelente producto
"stop reading the reviews and just order this thing.<br />i'd been using the bulb aspirator on my 3mo old and she was hating it ! this product worked in seconds, removing a couple tough boogers that had kept her from sleeping and nursing well for days. she hardly noticed the nose piece when i used it on her since it was soft and shaped right for her little nose. it worked so fast i surprised myself and she giggled.<br />i also  dig that the company sent a little card saying they were a small company and that reviews would help them keep"
my son loves this book!
Calms my baby down right away. It seems a little big for her so I am thinking of also trying the gumdrop ones.
My baby who is ebf doesn't usually like pacifiers but he really likes this one. Unfortunately so does our dog who ate the other one in this set..
The go to pacifier. Helps keep it in baby's mouth and something for them to grasp. My daughter loves it.
We owned these from the store and they are exactly the same. Too bad my grandson decided he was done with pacifiers one week later
My 1.25 yr old son is obsessed with his &#34;Bubba&#34;
Baby loves these!
i got these as spares for my son when he was little.  i froze these for when he was teething.  i would recommend them to anybody.
"item delivered on time, was as described"
"smaller than i expected, but my daughter loves it and refuses a larger pillow even though she is three now."
my 5 month old loves this! it helps him stretch and strengthen his little legs!
"my son had baby eczema from birth until now, his pediatrician had prescribed him cortisone cream for his red dry itchy patches, behind his knees, elbows, ankles etc...i started using this body/shampoo was along with the lotion and it worked wonders, you can't even tell he has eczema besides for the occasional barely noticeable patch on his leg, i buy in bulk and it last me months its a bit pricey but i highly recommend with the use of eczema or other baby skin conditions."
i like it
Thank you .
While she can't talk yet it the type she'll use
well designed.
washes well; i hung it to dry to prevent shrinkage.
well made. should be longer.
prepare for the upcoming birth of my baby
excelente producto

just as advertised!
"Some hospitals have gone 180 against formula and pacifiers. This is what 2 years ago the hospital gave us after your daughter was born and it was a God send to soothe her. I am all for breast feeding, but the baby does not need to be on your nipple all the time. Give the a break and give the baby this!"
What can I say? I don't know what I'd do without these binkies. We have about 10 of them because we are always losing them!
This is the only pacifier my daughter will use!
"My nephew loves these!  He's started teething, so we keep a glass of ice water nearby and dip it in every so often."
The glow in the dark feature is awesome....especially at 3 in the morning when your searching for it
My son loves his wubb!!
thank you
excelente!
Got this for the parents to keep an eye on baby.  This unit allows you to visualize and or audio.
compatible with our bottles and wash well
"more fun than anything.  if you're cutting one banana, is it worth it?  probably not.  if you're cutting several bananas?  absolutely.  just rinse it off immediately after using - before the fruit residue has a chance to dry - and it should last a long time."
i should have bought 10!
just like the spouts that come with the cups!
thank you
my 2 year old loves these. the shipping was somewhat slow.
The dogs liked it too:(!
Grandson carries it everywhere.
Just what every baby of a dedicated Buckeyed fan needs!
"I have bought WubbaNubs for my children, my niece, and friends. Everyone loves them!"
excelente
"gift to son&swift, they use it."
Newborns love these! I got them for my niece here in Korea and she is obsessed!
These are the only pacifier my breastfed baby would take.
Three 2-packs. Stronger than the newborn ones.

My 3 month old loves this binky. She cuddles the lamb while she sucks the binky. I am so thankful for this product. Her daycare provide also loves this item as well because of how well it stays in place. A must have for any new baby.
quality binky
My son loves his WubbaNubs!  We have the frog and the monkey and he has used them since he was only a few weeks old.  Having the animal attached to the pacifier has really helped us keep track of the pacifier (we haven't spent lots of money on lost binkies).  We get lots of compliments of this and it's a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in the store.
a must have for babies..
"Our girl didn't like any pacifies we tried, expert this one."
"I love these! The nipple part is the same size as the 0-3mo pacifiers, but these ones are a lot thicker around the base and also the nipple is a lot tougher for their teething."
Excelente
My daughter loves these things!!!
"These have really stepped up bed time with our little ones! Making it easier to find these things in the dark is also a big bonus! The glow last at least an hour or two and even longer depending on how dark the room is.  Every parent knows how hard it is to get kids to go to their room and go to bed.  Now, all we use are these glow in the dark pacis and our 1.5 year old son who only gets them at night is super excited to go to bed."
This was the only paci my daughter used.
Was a baby shower gift. She went crazy over this thing. It was the one  thing that she really wanted. She was screeching when she saw it.
You can't have a redneck baby without one of these!
The babe loves them although he can't yet read.

not sure what we would've done without this. baby loves it! newborn must have!
As described
"My littlest one only likes Mam binkies. Spits all others out. Not sure why, but i'l take it"
I cannot stop playing picturing my nephew with pacifier in his mouth. I can't wait until he comes back so that i can snap a gazillion photos of him with it.
our grandson loves this seat!
this item was a birthday gift to my granddaughter. i'm told that she enjoys playing with her baby stroller. the baby stroller is sturdy and well constructed. i did order this item at the last minute but because i have amazon prime the package arrived in time for my granddaughter's birthday party.
i thought we could get away with just using a trash can in until our room started to seriously smell.
"bought two, have one downstairs to change the baby on and one in the baby bag"
grandbaby loves it!!!!
Hilarous
no more searching for paci in the middle of the night!
the only bottle my son would drink from after 3 months.

she loves the lights and the comfort of the seat!

looks just like the pictures
my son loves these
"solid caps are a must if you're traveling with the bottles. we don't use formula yet but i bet you would need these to mix up formula in the bottle too as it would just get stuck in all the bottle parts and clump. anyway, no leaking with these caps just a pain though that i have to carry a seperate zip bag with the other bottle parts as this lid won't work with those attached."
worked well
"the only paci my baby will accept, I have tried avent and nuby and she wont like them."
My grandson Logan couldn't be without it
"The only ones my boys took. Every baby is different so I can't rate based on that. Personally though, these pacifiers saved my sanity. I spent a lot on pacifiers, tried different brands. These were the ones. BUT they are so much cheaper in stores (burlington, less than half the price).<br />So now how do I get my 2 year old off of them?!"
We haven't tried the monkey yet but we have the giraffe and my son loves it even at a month old he wrapped his little arms around it while sucking it washes well too
"My baby was in love with her Wubbanubs from first sight.  The only &#34;problem&#34; is that it's been hard to try and transition her to other pacifiers now that she's older- I wish the animal was detachable and could be switched out to other styles of pacifiers.  It does lose its plumpness after a few months but nothing has become unstitched.  They say to switch out after a few months but the pacifier shows no wear and tear, and can be cleaned, so there hasn't been a need to buy a replacement."
these were the only bottles our breastfed daughter would use when i went back to work at 12 weeks.  i purchased them on recommendation of our daycare and have not been disappointed.
worked just as expected.
as described.
Our son loves it!
Not the same material as the ones we got in the hospital but my LO will take them over any other paci.

My oldest loves her ellie and hoping the new baby does too.  Provides comfort and security in such a small toy.
Cute reindeer.  Granddaughter loves all her Wubbanubs and will not only suck on the pacifer but she also chews on the stuffed animal. Just wish Wubbanubs weren't so expensive.
It meets my Granddaughters expectation!!!

These save our life when he wakes up at 5am -- you can see where the paci is and pop it back in before the freakout. The only brand that our baby will use.
For some reason this is the only style our son likes!  Can't have enough of them on hand!
Shuts up your kids as advertised!
life savers!
"my grandson loves this toy!  i thought this was too expensive, but after seeing how much he loves it, i bought this one for my house and one for my nephew's baby.  my grandson bites on different parts from the nose, back and legs as different parts are harder than others.  his sophie is actually getting softer as he chews it so much.  it is a must have teether toy even at the cost.  he is 7 months old and has been chewing on this for several months now."
Heavy for babies ... hysterical for parents.
The baby loves it

"The same quality of all other Avent's products. The only &#34;problem&#34; is the bottle nipple number 2, because my baby is already in number 4."

Not much to say about this. The kitty takes a lot of abuse and hasn't fallen apart. Makes it easier to keep track of the pacifier.
LUV IT!!
These actually work! Now my baby hardly ever loses his pacifier anymore and needs me to find it for him.
"These are the only pacifiers my son likes. The portion that goes in the mouth is shaped differently from traditional pacifiers, but they're nice for kiddos who are teething constantly (it seems like a tooth pops out every week!). There are little bumps at the base to help massage gums, too."
So ugly!! The best pacifier on the market!!
Every baby. Needs one
My son loves it

"These are the only pacifiers that my daughter will take. She is exclusively breastfed and these cause her no nipple confusion. While we were in the hospital, they gave her NUK pacifiers and they were too big for her little mouth. Every time we gave one to her she would choke, cough, and scream. We went out and bought a pack of Soothies and we will never use anything else."

bought this for my friends baby when he was a newborn (he is now a few months over 1 year old) and now this is the only nook he will use.  He has gotten plenty regular ones as presents and just spits it out.  This thing is the only thing that will stop him from crying. He loves it.
Plain and simple my baby loves this pacifier.
This is Ralph and our baby loves him!

My baby wont take any other bottle now. She loves these.
I have reordered these probably 5 times. My LO loves them. They were the only ones that didn't leave a dent around his lips from where he sucked.
my daughter loves this seat - no complaints whatsoever.
"brought for grandson , he enjoys."
"it took a few tries, but after we figured it out, my baby lived in this! we took walks and did chores together, and she loves to see what i'm doing! she's now a year old and we still use it"
my little girl loves them.  nothing like a swarm of butterflies to brighten up a room.
just what i was looking for!
My son will only use MAM binkeys and these ones glow in the dark so its easier to find it in the crib. Only wished the glow would last a little longer.
uhnn... genius!!!
"my daughter hates sippy cups... particularly the spout cups.  we have had luck with straw cups, and this is one of the few she's tolerated without throwing across the room.  so five stars it gets!!"
My kid can't here enough of his froggie. It's now his comfort toy. I have 3

"baby took a little while to get used to it cause she had a standard regular one for a while. but when she got used to it, there was no turning back."
See prior review on this product...
adorable and silly!
bought this to cover a wedding cake.  worked like a dream!
this is the cadillac escalade of baby buggies.  bought for my daughter as a baby shower gift.<br />durable and the combo of car seat and carriage can't be beat.
cuty~
works well. keeps the pumps in place.
my 17 month old son loves to walk around stores with me but he's not great at remembering to hold my hand. this solves the problem and it's discreet enough that i don't get as many nasty looks as i would if i put him in a traditional kid harness/leash. it's a great tool for teaching him to remember to hold hands and it gives him the freedom to get out of the cart or carriage and explore the world.
"while you can still see some imprints in the leather after removing the car seat, the leather isn't harmed which is what we were trying to avoid. even in our subaru which has pretty poor quality leather this product did well."
arrived on time... package damaged but nothing broken the screen was scratched though
"item delivered on time, it was as described"
helped make pumping easier
Our daughter loves this giraffe. It worked well for us and lasted almost 2 years. No she has a Giraffe #2.
Can't wait to recieve it
Loves his Philly pacifier!

"The only pacifier my baby will accept.  I bought 12 of these because, like socks, they disappear!"
Glow. In. The. Dark.  nuff said
"Have purchased 10+ of these b/c it's the only pacifier my little guy likes. The only down side is that the nipple and base are two separate parts, smag and nasty food particles get trapped in between and cleaning effort are futile to removing any of it; hence the purchase of so many. I suppose these things should be replaced periodically any way, so not gonna stop us from buying them. BE WARNED: your little man will get gads of attention where ever you go, great reactions from people."
As Described
"giraffe's long neck allows my baby to grab it easily. unfortunately, my baby is a hand/finger sucker rather than a paci sucker. product is good though."
"holds in the smell, washes up well."
my 8 month daughter lives this!
she loves it!!!
no prob
my grandbaby loves it
These rock! Only thing my daughter will take. Were given these in the hospital too.
Baby loves them..
yase
This was the brand and model my girl was given at the hospital and that's all she's ever used.
Excelente
muy buenos exelentes
These are the only pacifiers that my daughter will use! They also used these in the hospital.  They are shaped to prevent nipple confusion.
She loves it

my daughter loves this and won't go to sleep without it!
person loves this gift
excelent product
"as grandparents, we purchased these for our granddaughter. the pricey disposable diapers were giving her baby boy a diaper rash as well as these do save money."
Works perfects for the Ikea changing table.
"These wipes have multiple uses.  These are safer to use when cleaning surfaces that come in contact with children's mouth (i.e., toys, pacifiers, and breast-pumping flanges)."
they were just what i wanted.
cutest diaper bag i have ever seen.  has everything.  she loves it.
as described
A must have!
excelent product and seller. 100% recomended.
this memory book has everything you could possibly want to document with plenty of spaces for pictures.
my granddaughter loves her napmat. her baby dolls likes it.
Our daughter uses this all the time. This model stays in her mouth easiest.
Excelente

BABY LOVES EM
This item will go in the pinata for my daughter's baby shower.
Bought at an affordable price.
What can I say? It a pacifier
"To prepare for the future BABY, rest assured to use again"
100%
i think all parent should get the  sing  for theist kids room  i know  i did  to reminder  her who  she  is and where  she is going in  her life
"present for my grandson, he just loves it"
"i think i need a guide to know how to use it as expected.<br /><br />the instruction just told me how to use, rather than how to use, you know it."
"The ONLY paci we could use, and now its the only we would use"
Excelente
My daughter loves these things.  She has four wubbanub pacifiers.
fun game
Our friends and family can't stop laughing every time my son uses this pacifier! Double bonus is my son loves it too!
just what i need
Granddaughter loves
My son couldnt hold a pacy in his mouth by his self since he is a preemie. This has helped him get the soothing he needs and he loves to hold it.
Bought for daugter to carry in her diaper bag.
If you want to get sleep buy this. No more searching in the night for the paci. You have to have it for a newborn... It is seriously the sweetest pacifier around. My daughter loves them. I have 3 of them
"GO EAGLES.<br /><br />Good pacifiers, no issues at all!!"
Daughter loves it.
I do think it makes my Co-workers uncomfortable when I break them out during a stressful day.
"Awsome, I can choose the color and dont have to wait to see what color they are"
All as expected
was using summer infant pad but our son's head was small so bubbling everywhere especially while sleeping. these elephant ears lock his head in place.
"my son loves this pillow. he is 3 years old and it gives him just the right support for his head and neck. the fact that its so shallow and forms to the body, neck,head shape of the child makes me worry less about his neck development."
"my sister has this for her uppababy stroller and she loves it. i was looking for one myself, but unfortunately it didn't fit my jj cole broadway stroller -- the bar was too wide. sad to send it back."
A big hit for my great-grandson!
Likes it
this necklace was purchased for a 7 month old baby boy that was drooling so bad that he was literally soaking 3-5 bibs a day simply with drool.  2 days after putting this necklace on him the drool has almost completely stopped and he is no longer wearing bibs to catch drool all day long.  i will be the first to tell you that i was a skeptic...but this product works and i am in awh of what it has done.
"we got these on recommendation from my lactation consultant, they flow much much flower then any other bottle we tried.  now at three months my baby boy has rejected this bottle, apparently that is common to happen.  i don't blame the bottle.<br /><br />note that these are the 8oz glass bottles, not 4oz.  i didn't realize that when i bought these."
easy to assemble. fast shipping and it does come with car seat base

GAVE IT AS A GIFT
"After trying some, I give this pacifier a try because it was orthodontic. Now my daughter only likes this one and never used again the others. I wish it comes with a cap"
As advertised
Grandson Joshua loves it and every boy needs a puppy!!
Baby won't have any other type!  Loves it!
our baby boy just loves it. he spends almost 2 hours every day through out the day on his jumperoo.
Go Gators
Baby can see his paci in the dark. I'm sold. And Amazon is the only place I can find the 2 pack. Thank you!
"Baby likes, & coloring not too offensive/fussy looking."
avent pacifiers rule.  my nieces came home from the hospitals with them and my sister swears by this mold.  a pair is always included for every baby shower gift.
I bought this because my newborn kept spitting out his binky and it was driving me crazy... We love the giraffe because I can prop the giraffe against him and keep the binky in his mouth.
These are the only pacifier that he will use. Wont leave home without one.
These are the only pacifiers our daughter has ever taken. She loves them and so do we! Knowing that she's not sucking on a chemical-filled piece of plastic makes me feel a million times safer.
product is as described.
my girl loves it
i use these regularly around the house for random things.  i have one on a pump in my laundry room that controls a pump in the ro/di container.
My son loves this nook. not much else to say other than it does what it's supposed to. It helps my son sleep at night.
My son loves his wubbanubs!
I have given these are baby shower gifts on multiple occasions and bought them for my two nieces. I always get the same review from the Moms...&#34;My child loves her/his Wubbanub!!!&#34;
My baby doesn't use a pacifier but she uses it to chew on while she's teething. We don't leave home without it!
I going to have baby this September. i want to take some picture of him when he using this thing. Just not sure it's safety enough.
My baby is 3 months old and has had colic since about her 2nd week so we broke down and gave her a paci!  This is the only brand and style paci she takes and she loves it!  It calms her down and has never interfered with her ability to latch onto the breast!
"My child loves them, and now so does every baby at daycare... they are constantly trying to snatch the different looking paci.<br /><br />She always wants to put the wrong end or the sides in her mouth, and this was the only paci that was soft on all sides."
Works great! No more losing the pacey in the crib! No more rolling under the couch! No more digging in the car seat! No more silly hooks and straps! We love it and wish we would have bought an extra for the times when it needs a wash.
Exactly the same as what my newborn was given at the nicu and at the children's hospital. When I brought the baby home my dog found the pacifiers on the coffe table and decided that they were dog chew toys so I ordered these to replace them.<br /><br />My only dumb move was that I didn't double check the scent. My daughter was using the vanilla scented ones in the nicu and these were unscented. She still loves them but I will order the vanilla scented ones next time(and hide them from the dog.)
I brought the pacificers as a gift for my grandson.. It was exactually what I wanted..its for my sons  son.
I bought these in bulk so we weren't constantly looking for the pacifier. I put 2 or 3 in daughter's crib so she can look for it at night and self soothe.
They are the only pacifiers my daughter will take.  She is exclusively breast feed so we had a hard time finding one she would use. We tried 3 different brands before finding these.
"with my first son, i was afraid this stroller would be too heavy and bulky, so i went with a different 3-wheel option, and regretted it. with my second, we purchased this stroller and could not be happier for several reasons:<br />- it's very easy to assemble<br />- it maneuvers easily<br />- the ride is extremely smooth<br /><br />as to the complaints in other reviews about it being difficult to use the basket under the seat when the seat is reclined, this is somewhat true, but a small con given the many pros. i can, however, still easily fit a couple of (plastic) bags of groceries into the basket (from the rear or side) without disturbing my son even in the reclined position."
These pacifier are the bees knees! My son loves them AND they do not leave indention's around his mouth like EVERY other hard plastic pacifier does. Will not buy anything else.
"Can't be put into the mouth upside down. Both sides are low, so the baby's nose doesn't get blocked like other designs"
YOU MUST BUY TODAY !  I BOUGHT SEVERAL AND YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG FOR THE PRICE AND LOOKS LIKE YOU SPENT A LOT MORE.
The only pacifiers my baby will use.<br />Great message on them also.<br />I have about 15 of them now!<br />Here is another sentence to satisfy the word count for this review
Tried other organic ones but out daughter loves this one.  Probably because of the texture as its on the softer side.<br />Definitely recommend!
my daughter's must have.  She has to have 2 at a time.  one in her hand and one in her mouth.  price is cheaper than stores
These pink soothies appear to be a little firmer than the green ones that we have both gotten at the hospital and online. It's nice to have something a little prettier than the green for your little girls!
"Mine will go back and forth between this and a Nuk pacifier but she holds onto this while in the carseat either way.  We bought a few different styles, the elephant specifically to try to keep it near her mouth when we were driving."
works
Before I found these I would watch my son on the monitor struggle to find his pacifiers in his dark room during the night.  Give these bad boys a few minutes in the light (sunlight especially) and they rock for hours.
works as described no problems with it. it saves running up and down the stairs to check on kids at nap time.
i have been using this product for a long time and don't leave the house without it. i usually carry several covers in my purse. the main advantage over the paper toiler covers in public restrooms is that it wraps around the toilet seat and that is where kids put their little hands. the only disadvantage is that it is not flushable and you have to find a trash can to dispose it in and you have to be careful not to touch part of the used cover.
the product is equal to what they promote. it met my expectations. recommended 100%. i have no complaints. i agree with what you buy
my son is six and a half months and we also have the activity mat. he loves this one too. it is very portable and he loves the pattern and the little toys attached to it.
"this travel bag was a lifesaver for us, we gate checked it and there was plenty of room in it to store some other baby essentials!!"
Just a small thing for my niece who just had twins.  I think the labels will get laughs from their friends.
This mustachifier says &#34;I will complete the 72 oz. steak challenge at the local saloon.&#34;  It turns your little baby into a country ladykiller instantly.
seals the bottle every time.  keeps the milk where it should be.<br /><br />unlike there freezer bags.  that is an entirely different story.
These are the only pacis my daughter will use and they don't have them anymore in my toys r us or target.  Thank G-d.
"I hated these things before I had kids. I thought they looked so weird! However, I had to eat crow on this one after a friend gave us an Elephant wubanub and it was the only pacifier our kids would keep in their mouths! I think it's something to do with the toy being slightly slightly weighted that helps the babies keep the pacifier in instead of spitting it out because they can't keep the regular soothies with no toy attached in their mouths at all."
He put those in his mouth all day and all night.And they are his toys too.He likes to play them.
There are some pacifiers that say 0-3 months for a reason. These were bought for my newborn but my older kid takes them and chews on them too. They hold up well and the shape is preferred by almost all of the babies I know. (Which is a little disappointing because they're not cute.) They are a little weird when in use since you can see into the back. It's hard to resist sticking a pinkie in to the chomping pink/purple baby jaws.
Yes this is the same standard pacifier we received at the hospital and of course the only one our son likes.  Nothing fancy and cheaper than most...gets the job done!  Thank God for simplicity
"Our 7 month old hates pacifiers and never uses them :( However, this dragon wubbanub is his crib friend! He never sucks on it but he likes to mouth the stuffed animal part and hold it while falling to sleep. When he started teething he likes to chew on the pacifier part. So even though it's not used for it's intended purpose, I'm glad we bought it!"
Brought these for my infant because the cheap pacifiers keep saliva and mess inside now. Hate it! I went back to soothies because they are much cleaner then the regular $1 pacifiers.
My baby loves IT!!!!!!!! She was amazed to have a toy and pacified that she could hold and play with.
Have not unpacked it yet -gift baby not due until mid May - this is silly to have a word limit
it is offered on the website
have not unpacked it yet -gift baby not due until mid may - this is silly to have a word limit
bought this for my granddaughter and she has a blast in it. plus there are lots of places to attach toys so she can't drop them.  added bonus the ones we hung she crawls over to a plays with on her back.
"These are the same pacifiers provided in our NICU, which means our little one had a preference for them when we left the hospital. Unlike the other gumdrop pacifiers these ones have a slight dusty texture to them and aren't slick smooth.<br /><br />I never noticed the orange scent on them but that didnt matter. These are durable and the cut out on the top helps keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth because it not bumping up against the baby's nose."
My little man &#34;wakes up&#34; in the middle of the night. He's not really awake but my constant searching for his paci would end up waking him...this solves that problem!!!
"i had a hard time weaning my lo from bottle to regular sippy cups. i saw this with a silicone spout like the sippy cup but at the same time it is soft like the nipple. after a few months lo started drinking from this bottle without the spout, doesn't want to let go of the hk bottle but hey - no more nipple / spout."
"this is a truly high quality lunch bag. although it may seem pricey, the quality of this product is outstanding.  we have used it with our toddler for almost 2 years and it is still in the same great shape it was when we bought it.  no issues with the seams or zippers and every spill you can imagine has easily come out in the wash.  the color hasn't faded a bit either.<br /><br />although it is not an insulated lunch bad, it keeps my daughter's lunch cold for up to 4 hours when i add a cold pack to the bag with her lunch."
I luv it and my daughter luvs it too. I've ordered this product before and i will continue ordering til my daughter grows out of it.. no more losing her pacifier.
"I bought this for my new grand daughter.  She had the Big Red Dog, Clifford WubbaNub but I wanted her to have a little girly one.  I bought this one and the caterpillar.  She loves them all.  And, unlike a single Nub, these are pretty difficult to lose.  Not too big, and not too small.  Soft as can be.  You'll be tempted to buy them all."
we bought this while traveling to my in-laws - it's not good for a full-time high chair but it did the trick while traveling
These are the only pacifiers our newborn would take. We bought several and used them until around 2 months and then switched to the next size up. We did not get the style pictured which was disappointing but it was listed that way so not a big deal.
"Yup, they pacify the kid and they can truly be cleaned in the microwave. And they come in a sturdy box that the almost-toddler has not bitten, scratched or destroyed using brute force. Hallelujah! (Plus, these are not advertised as glow-in-the-dark, and I don't know if my batch was mixed up, but they do glow!)"
"My son will only use soothie pacifiers, and he loves that this one has a monkey.  The plush toy makes the pacifier easier to keep an eye on when we are out, so I like it too."
We used these pacifiers pretty heavily from 4 wks old to 3.5 months.  Now he has self weaned down to use them only when trying to fall asleep.
This works just as others described.  My five month old constantly spits out his pacifier but this gives him something to hold onto to help it stay in place.  Its also a lot easier to find when it gets laid down somewhere than a little pacifier all by itself.
My daughter holds the owl in her little hands so the binky stays in her little mouth. Genius! It's a must in our baby bag.
"I absolutely love this paci holder! It's too bad my son doesn't take a paci anymore, but I recommend 100%"
My daughter loves this!!! She is a breastfed baby and this is the only thing that calms her when I'm at work
my granddaughter loves the ducks! she has begun to collect them and loves making videos with them. these ducks have been carried everywhere.
"my son loves these pacifier, i wish they were a little cheaper but i like that they are silicone and not hard or in different pieces. my sone enjoys sucking on this pacifier and chewing on it for teething."
"frankly, although this is marketed as a child's nightlight, i wouldn't mind having one myself.  bought for all my grandsons (4 in two states), and they cannot go to bed without it, for a few years now.  it really makes the ceiling splendiferous.  they can choose a different color each night.  i would have to say that no child should be without one.  period."
"Everything was just like it was described.  In package, it was unopened, as described and was unused as described also."
I have used these for 3 years now and love them. Other pacifiers missalligned my children's bite and these have not. I still continue to use them even after the kids are 6 months old b/c they are smaller and mess with their bite less. My only issue is they are hard to find very expensive.
"Our twins prefer Dr. Browns over any other pacifier they have tried. The handles can be distracting for them when they are going to sleep, so we usually cut those off ."
"bought 4 of these, they are the only textured pacifiers he will take.  we have tried others from babies r us...."
"...Because they don't have a space that you can't get to or wash. These are the best.<br /><br />Other pacis that have the nipple that is a &#34;closed loop&#34; allow water to get into the nipples but won't allow the water out...So after a while, I can imagine mold growing inside the nipples. When I saw the water after I washed the other nipples, I just threw them away.<br /><br />These pacies, you can wash every aspect."
"the story, the colors, the crinkly flaps - it all works. keeps my little girl entertained and that's all i could ask for."
"My son was such a fan of the wubbanub, now I buy them for all my friends that are expecting."
"unfortunately we're not able to set up my daughters crib at the moment so i've had her in the playpen. she would not sleep at all on just the pad (i don't blame her, it's really hard!). so, we decided to give this mattress a try and she absolutely loves it! i was afraid it was going to be too tough but it's actually a little soft. now my 2 month old sleeps right on through the night on it!"
our friends were delighted..it met their needs in style<br />we would suggest this to anyone. all inclusive<br />easy to use and comfy for the babies
i am a fan of tommee tippee and am disappointed my youngest doesnt care for the nipple. however my oldest loves them and they have stood up to her usage for almost 2 years. i recommend these to any breast feeding moms switching to bottles.
"my son takes it to be with him every night. he is 2. he can turn in on him self and it he forgets to turn it off, it turns off in 30 minutes."
"Impossible for my baby to spit her paci away now! This keeps it close enough that even if it's out of her mouth, she can get it back in! Genius idea! LOVE IT"
My son loves this and always asks for his giraffe. After losing dozens of binkys I wish I would have had this from the start!
These pacifiers are wounderful. They are flush enough that they don't get knocked out while my son is sleeping. He loves them!!
"I tried giving my newborn MAM pacis and she wanted nothing to do with them. After having a thumb sucker and another child who took Soothies I wanted one of my kids to take ortho pacis, but no luck. She is EB, so I didn't think a paci with a nipple that didn't resemble a real nipple would work anyway so went ahead and ordered these. My 2 year old uses Soothies so she had already claimed all the green, pink, and purple ones. I didn't want their to be jealousy with the transition of a new baby so I got yellow for the new baby."
i've read reviews in which the reviewer writes about an odor or rancid smell. i have not found that to be the case.
a lady in our church is having a baby and this is one of the items she requested as a gift.
"it fits a lot of stuff inside; not just dr. brown's products. we go through lots of bottles and pumping equipment and only have to run it twice a day, max."
"Cute, durable, washable, and fits easily into little hands. Also, very difficult to lose! I get a lot of compliments on these and own 3 total. To wash, I place in wash machine on cold setting, no detergent or baby detergent, then air dry."
"Cute, durable, washable, and fits easily into little hands. Also, very difficult to lose! I get a lot of compliments on these and own 3 total. To wash, I place in wash machine on cold setting, no detergent or baby detergent, then air dry."
wish it was for 6-12 months...little small for my 8 month old but the frog is cute.  I would recommend to a younger baby.  My bad for not seeing the months suggested.
"When someone won't stop complaining about Wes Welker leaving the Pats for Denver, this is the cutest way to make them STFU."
"The mattress that came with our pack'n'play is horrible and extremely hard. We bought this to use, and love it. My 18 month old sleeps on it every night. It works well with the pack'n'play sheets and wet pads we already had. It's a little unwieldy when we have to bring it somewhere, but it's better than him sleeping on something that feels like hard cardboard."
"Can't go wrong with this brand, it's the only one my son will take. I got two basketball pacifiers in my shipment. As expected."
I tried several other kinds of pacifiers but this is the only one she will take. She is 3 months old.
These are the only pacifiers that our daughter's will use. These are similar to what we received at the hospital.  They hold up well and she refuses any other pacifiers.
these things are pretty neat and your kid will love them. and it helps comfort them too. only bad this is im afraid my nephew might be going to pre school with it lol.......just kidding
This maybe the last one.  But I don't think so.  She loves this type of  pacifier.  Can be washed and or boiled
"My newborn continued to root even after breast feeding and bottle supplementing. A nurse recommended these pacifiers and my son loves them. He uses them until he falls asleep and then he drops it out of his mouth. There is a small handle on its end that he holds onto sometimes. Since we seem to loose them around the house, we have repeated our purchase of these."
It was a gift for my sisters baby!! She loves it!!! But my note didn't come with so she didn't know who it was from tough... :/
"our infant daughter has trouble keeping the other more expensive pacifiers in her mouth, but not the AVENT. the clear plastic allows you to see the mouth and whether or not it is dirty. skip the more expensive ones and get this one."
these things are pretty neat and your kid will love them. and it helps comfort them too. only bad this is im afraid my nephew might be going to pre school with it lol.......just kidding
THANK YOU I RECEIVED CANT WAIT TO USE IT<br />I HAVENT YET TAKEN OUT OF THE PLASTIC WILL SOON ENOUGH
this stays put wherever i placed it. i put it on my steps and corners for my toddler. i had tile steps in kitchen and living room. also have wood steps and countertop edges. none have fallen off.
i like it! a retard can snap the lock on the strap together my baby fits in it well and i have not had a problem as of yet!
sheet is exactly what my daughter needed putting the baby to bed. the sheet is cozy and warmer when she lays him down and not the shocking cotton sheet which would wake him up.
"got this for a little girl room age 4, she loves it, sleeps with like a stuff animal, i don't know if hypo allergic or even washable."
"Every parent must have this if your child likes the pacifier. My daughter loves her paci but had a hard time going to sleep as she would drop it, this helped correct that problem. Thank you."
This dragon soother has saved us countless pick-ups off the floor.  When the soother pops out we have time to get it before it slides off her body.  She also pets the plush dragon while soothing herself so it serves two purposes.
This is the only pasi my daughter would take and still uses. I have it multiple colors but amazon is the only place we could get yellow. These are a pain when she throws from her crib as they roll under everything and it's become a game in our house to see who can find the pasi.
Fits my babys mouth perfectely! my baby sucks on it a lot and these are the ones you need because they are very durable!
"They last a long time, I can only find the blue ones online.<br />They sell pink at walgreens for girls.<br />Only passifier my 10 month old will take since birth."
"Don't buy these for your child, MY son won't use anything else, and they are really expensive and hard to find"
We have used mam pacifiers for all three of our children. They are the only ones my little ones will use.
"These are the only pacies she likes. What I like is that they are fully silicone (or whatever that is), so there are no parts that can break off and become a choking hazard. I also like that they are softer than the pacifiers with the plastic base, which can be abrasive to a baby's sensitive mouth."
"When the baby drops them, the dogs have a party. Easier to keep off the floor than the standard pacifier"
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Soothie Pacifier, Green, 3+ Months, 6 pack .Three sets of two pacifiers, 6 green soothies total."
Just like the one the hospital gave us except in blue and the only pacifier my son will take. Lifesaver!
"And because these are made from a single piece of rubber, no dirt accumulates anywhere on the paci. And because there're no plastic parts, when the kid rolls over one in sleep, it doesn't hurt and wake him up."
Stores around here do not carry this type of pacifier and my toddler won't use anything else.  I was down to my last one and then this package arrived and saved the day!!!
A MUST HAVE!!! The WubbaNub held my son's pacifier in (or close enough he could reach it) through the night! Eliminates that constant searching through the bed trying to find a paci!
My son loves these! This is the same one that comes on the wubbanub and my son likes the soothies. I buy them for every friend I know having a baby!
You will always have a paci on hand with this! It attaches wherever you need it so you won't be without one!
My  boy and daughter in law being a Wyoming cowboy Fans I thought this might look the part  on my newest grandson
"Received exactly what I ordered. I wish you could specify a color rather than assorted, though.  Should specify boy (blue) or girl (pink) or neutral (green or yellow).<br /><br />Carol Price"
"This item was recommended to me by a friend. I thought it was very silly, now I don't know if we could live without it! I am ordering another one just in case this one gets lost. It helps keep the binky in my daughters mouth, but also she likes to stroke the arms and legs and seems to find it comforting. It also makes it much easier to find in the diaper bag without taking everything out of the bag in a mad search for a binky. I will buy one for every baby shower I go to from now on."
This is the second time I am buying it. The teat is flat and I can tell my son prefers this shape to others.
"Simply, babies love these and they become their comfort toy and a must for parents. My daughter hated giving hers up as she was growing up."
Was the hit of the baby shower. A little on the small side but still fun. have to cut out the pacifiers yourself
"we used this constantly when our little one discovered that they could wriggle out of swaddles, but were still too small to have their arms loose at night.  when baby could roll over we simply popped the arm snaps open and continued to use it."
sticks well to the corners of my table.  have bumped the corners often with my hip and the edges remain on the table!
"After using this with our newborn to help reduce the number of times we'd have to pick up a dropped pacifier from his mouth while soothing him, we became instant fans.  It's now my go-to gift for moms-to-be.  It's saved our sanity a number of times already!"
"These are a little blessing while having a newborn!  Our daughter takes these very well.  They don't sit against their little faces, so moisture doesn't get trapped.  Sad these are only for 0-3 months since our daughter turns 3 months tomorrow.  Hopefully the next step up Avent pacifiers work just as well."
I love these little binkies! My son has 3 and they don't get lost or left behind as often as some of the other ones he used. I get a lot of compliments. They are washable and durable and double as teddy bear. I would recommend.
I have bought tons of binkies and this is the only one that hasn't disappeared.  I don't know where the other ones end up.  My daughter loves this Wubbanub.
my little girl loves her potty chair!  the color but looks pink...it's purple!  have to leave it on or buy a hook to hang it on.
exlente
"We would be lost without a few of these - one in the each car and one in the house. Seriously, the kid loves it. We are a little worried about having to break the habit, but willing to take that chance for the comfort this gives her now. They are well constructed, they come in numerous styles, and they are easy to wash. We have purchased several of these for friends now, too."
"These are exactly like the pacifiers given at the hospital. I had a hard time finding some just like it, and they are the only type my daughter will use."
this is a geat prouct! the girls play with it every single day! i like the different options the piano has.
My Grandson loves it... As soon as he put it in his mouth there was no letting go.<br />Perfect Product
"These are the cutest pacifiers I've bought my grandson. Even though I wish he would give them up, I would rather he have these that look like a bigger boy."
My 4 month baby love this binky! He loves to hold it. The only bad thing is you can't sterilized it.
My toddler loves pink bear. She lives with it and we are already on our third one in two years.
Can't say enough about these pacifiers! They have been a life saver! My daughter prefers this pacifier over other brands.
I will be getting another one for my granddaughter. Her kitty chewed the nipple off the one I got her and she will not take anything esle. She loves to hold the giraffe.
My baby takes this pacifier! It's a miracle! And he loves grabbing at the lamb to hold in his hands.
At one point these were very hard for me to find. Now they are everywhere. THESE ARE THE ONES GINEN TO NEWBORNS IN THE HOSPITAL.
She requested it so hopefully she doesn't have any complaints.<br />And now I just scribble on here bc i have too
"The Soothie pacifiers bounce when dropped.  If you have ever had the frustrating experience of searching under the couch with an infant in your arms, this is the product for you!  When the WubbaNub is dropped, it stays right where it was dropped.  And, bonus, the baby has learned to keep her pacifier in with stronger suction because she often knocks it about with her little infant arms."
"Twins were born at 26 weeks and the round gum drops pacis from the hospital were the only ones they would take.  The dentist hated the round gumdrops, but then I found these and dentist and babies approved.  Success!!  I also love that the pacifiers do not get water and soap stuck in the nipple when they are being washed since the nipple has an open design."
i've purchased this machine to blend fruit for my baby. it's saved me a lot of time since i no longer need to use the big blender. would definitely recommended this purchase.
i purchased this item for my daughter. she loves the bag. i would consider another one of a different color.
i like that this bag is double layered because it helps to keep smells at bay! we can easily fit 2 days worth of dirty diapers in it!
i put my kids snack in this and they eat it in the stroller. it holds a lot and holds their drink in place!
My daughter lives these things! She can hug it to hold it close and fling it across the room at 2 months.
They stay in his mouth and don't fall out and he took to these immediately after trying several others including Dr. Browns pacifiers and the one the hospital gave us and the soothie pacifiers (they popped out of his mouth even with a stuffed animal attached).  He is 5 months old.  They also come with a sanitizing box which you can microwave them in 3 minutes which I find easier than boiling.  MAM also sells a pacifier clip but it does not fit tightly enough for use on these small pacifiers.
"i can't comment on this brand compared to others, since this is the only one i have used, but i was solely breastfeeding and went back to work 10 weeks after giving birth. this product was a lifesaver.  and with the hands-free bra (you have to buy separately, but worth the extra $25) let's you pump both sides at the same time.  makes pumping a lot faster and easier.  highly recommend.<br /><br />update: i have noticed that on one side milk is leaking out the bottom of the shield (the funnel part).  i did a little poking around online and apparently the size of the shield can lead to leakage (which is really frustrating if you're producing just enough milk, it's like leaking liquid gold.)  going to try another size to see if that makes a difference."
My grandson loves his WubbaNub Brown Puppy. I got him a blue one too. He is just beginning to hold things and likes to grip on the stuffed puppy.
My baby loves that. He has 3  different ones. It is easier to find by himself during the night in the crib
I bought this for a little girl I babysit. She loves her wubbanubs! She has at least four of them!!
"my son calls his pacifiers &#34;ball&#34; because he loves the sports themed nuk pacifiers.  we got all basketball ones sent to us when we ordered, just FYI"
My son loves these! and I do too! We have about 20 of them in every part of the house !
Tried these with my breastfed baby. She took it for a few days.Hard to say bc she never wanted any pacifier. But shipping was fast.
Bought this when my son was only a few months old.  It made sleeping time such a breeze.  He still has it now and has become his Security blanket.
My son was born during the baseball season and he must have known it too.  He will only use Texas Rangers pacifiers to go to sleep.
These are the only ones my 8 month old will take. By these I mean this brand. They last!  I recommend the night ones for use in the dark....very clever!
"My daughter is obsessed with her wubba nub, the elephant in particular. She can't sleep without it. She doesn't even use the paci part, she like to move around with the legs in her mouth. She goes to sleep with the wubba nub in her hand and thumb in her mouth. I had to buy another for back up!"
He would not go to sleep without his Wubby! He always held on to the little animal like he was hugging it. Both my sons did this when they were little.
I bought the giraffe one of these for my niece before she was born and my sister said it was her favority binky.  It gives the baby something soft to hold onto even if they aren't using it in their mouth.  I have since gotten them for other nieces and nephews and the parents have told us that the kid won't use any other type now.
"if you have little ones, you know that these things get thrown, smashed, chewed on, etc. most of the ones i've used also leak, which is the worst thing. thus far, these come apart fro cleaning easily and have withstood the test of my two year old grandkids."
my  grandson and his wife are expecting their 1st baby.  they are both gator fans.  i will include this with the other baby items for the baby shower.  thank you!
it was excatly what i want it. my son enjoys it everytime he is in his crib<br />and i get to relax<br />thank you.
My baby loves this thing!  I had never heard of wubbanubs before but now I think everyone should have at least one.
My baby loves this thing!  I had never heard of wubbanubs before but now I think everyone should have at least one.  We have 4 now!
My little one can push this back into her mouth without exhausted mother getting up to help. That in itself makes this item one of my most valuable possessions. She also likes to snuggle her &#34;gator&#34; while falling asleep after she's spit the pacifier out.
"We were given these for our preemie in the hospital  and have been using it ever since. He's sort of grown out of having a pacifier, but we still keep them around just in case."
"Wonderful,my baby daughter loves it.Pretty colors,arrived quickly.Love the price.Thank you.I will continue to order them from you.Wonderful experience.Strong quality.Pretty,comfortable.Inexpensive.Daughter loves it."
"With out this crazy little dog I don't know what we would do. This is the gift I will give to every new Parent, we have bought 3 of them!"
"They gave my little man a soothie in the hospital when he was born, and now its all he will take."
Every new parents need a few of these! This combines a pacifier with a comfort toy. My grandson loves the wubbanubs.
"Although they get a bit sticky after a while and bounce off like crazy when you drop them, they are much softer then silicone and my son used to chew on it when he was teething. If you're gonna use a pacifer, give this one a try."
"With my first child, we lost pacifiers like crazy.  I bought this for our daughter and it is the only pacifier we use.  It falls out of her mouth less and she likes to hold onto the beanie baby."
"My daughter has been taking these since she was born, shes now almost three and I just cant get rid of them like I wanted to. The nipples are round and wont start messing up on you after all that chewing and sucking."
this is an expensive but really good car seat.  the only gripe is that older kids that are small for their age and still must be rear facing are a recline position that they usually don't like.
this product is the cutest item.. i just could not have picked a cuter theme for my grandson's son we r expecting in oct 2013...
"My kid has an obsession with pacifiers- will only use mams. If we try others, he freaks out. I like them too."
My girlfriend put this on her baby registry  (she registered for amazon.com) Her baby boy loves them. Its a good/trusted brand too.
"After reading an article about just how dirty enclosed pacifiers can get. Just chalk full of mold and other kinds of bacteria I knew I didn't want to use enclosed nipple pacifiers. After the first few days of using a wide nipple pacifier I switched to these. There seemed to be much less nipple confusion for my new baby. They are a little bit harder to hang onto for baby, but I really like these. Everyone loves how you can see their little tongue and lips sucking away~! I also appreciate the cut out for the nose. I don't like the Phillips ones for that reason!"
Bought  this for my nephew.  He loves it!!! He loves all wubbanubs.  They are also easier to keep track of than regular passifiers.
not only does my 1 year old like this but me and my boyfriend do too.<br />i have nothing negative to say at all
bought this for my car so that my wife and i can alternate taking and picking up our child from day care.<br /><br />works just like the one that comes with the b-safe car seat. no complaints!
our daughter loves it and it allows for both my wife and i to do homework while our daughter plays.
"i already owned one of these, and needed another. we use 2 in our house at the same time. they do not interfere with each other. we put 1 on channel a and the second one on channel b. we also have a big house and the monitors work throughout the house."
"i use it to carry my ipad, iphone, kindle, sketch book, pens, pencils and journal. i have to carry a small oxygen tank and have a problem carrying other items up and down the stairs. this serves the purpose. it is well made and has many pockets for different size items. i hope it will last a long time although i am 75 so it doesn't have to last too long. only kidding you serious ones."
i love this bag.  it is big enough to hold everything i need but not super bulky.  i chose this bag because of the optional backpack feature (as opposed to the boxy always having the straps out) and use it frequently. i had a jj cole bag before this one and could never get it closed and worried about things falling out.  the only annoying thing with this bag is that when you are wearing it as a backpack the front pocket is easily accessible.  i keep my phone and wallet in the pocket where the straps go so that they aren't there for the taking of anyone behind me.
we use it when we are changing his diaper and at night when he is in his swing.<br />he loves the music and looking at the images on the wall and ceiling
just like the one that came with the car seat. i've had this for about a month and love no more car swapping with the base!
"After trying 8 other types of pacifiers (all of which my now 4 week old breastfed baby tearfully HATED) I desperately went looking for something truly different. I ordered these despite the cost. They just arrived an hour ago and even though she's still figuring it out, she's napping now after putting herself to sleep with it.  Thank you!!"
"The only person who's opinion matters would probably give this 3 stars because it is not the duck WubbaNub, but your little one may think otherwise."
"She loves it. The monkey helps to not lose the paci, she loves her little monkey friend. Would buy for someone else."
for some reason our daugter prefers the orthodontic shape and it stays in her mouth better (less spitting out).  Most other orthodontic shaped pacifiers aer made of hard plastic this one is soft/rubbery so it doesnt leave the uncomfortable looking indentation on her face.
The giraffe with it's long neck seems to be the easiest for my baby to manipulate. She loves to have a pal to hold on to when she sleeps.  The shipping and price were competitive. I have no complaints.
"My grandson looks so silly in these teeth.  so funny...Great gift as a joke or for Halloween, or just for fun..."
"No more lost paci!  It is also more difficult for it to fall out of her mouth.  Now that she is a little older, she loves to rub it and snuggle it."
"One of the cutest pacifiers out there.  Have bought quite a few of the Wubbanub pacifiers and they are high quality, durable and everyone I have given one to loves them."
"It's great because she can hold onto it which means its less likely to fall, so no more dirty pacifiers!"
i bought these for our granddaughter and she loves them.  she enjoys them in the bathtub as well as in the pool and at the lake.
I guess these are safer because they're made of just a single piece of plastic / rubber / gum. My newborn seems to like them.
i purchased another set of these that were to deep and would not slide past the closet door hardware.  these did the trick!  just enough short to allow it to slide past the hardware and lock the doors from little fingers!
I used at a house party and the conversation they started got me laid 3 times. may just be the confidence the stache brings out in you though
"Why didn't I think of this? When swaddled, our little one will turn her head side to side and the soother will fall out. This keeps it on her chest so that she can find it again, versus it falling to the crib mattress."
"The cow is adorable. My daughter does not take a pacifier, I was hoping she would use this one but she just chews on it. But I have nothing bad to say about the product."
everything you need in a baby monitoring camera<br />i recommend it for everyone who need to check on their babies
"This was on their registry...I was a little concerned about it being removed from the registry after I purchased it because I'd had issues with that in the past (Not through Amazon!), but it was promptly removed. Can't wait to give it to the mom-to be!"
"Not only is she a fan of the soothie pacifier, but she also likes the frog attached to it.  It gives her something additional to play with!"
we have a colicly baby and she cries all the time. this helps her quiet down and i can get some things done at the same time. i am a guy so the stars are a little girly says my wife but i really don't care. i wanted one that wasn't dark in color as i wanted it to be cooler in summer weather for the baby.
this medicine dispenser is ingenious. my baby approaches it like a bottle or pacifier and happily sucks down whatever i need to give her without fuss. no more messing with medicine syringes or droppers!
My baby girl loves wubbaNub's! I bought the puppy & this one. When she would chew through the pacifier I would cut it off & she would still have her Elephant.
"My baby grew out of his other pacifiers and started devloping a habit of wanting a bottle to go to sleep, so these pacifiers took the place of a bottle when he is laying in his crob and he loves them."
"My baby is not a very big fan of pacifiers, she spits them out almost instantly. We have tried several different brands and types of pacifiers. The Phillips Avent Soothies are the only ones that she wont spit out. We have about 4 of these just in case they drop or get dirty. These pacifiers are advertised as &#34;helps calm and soothe newborns&#34; and I truly believe this, once we give our baby the pacifier she calms down right away. I would definitely recommend these pacifiers if your baby has a problem with all other ones."
"She took to it immediately and has been using it for about a month. There are similar products out in stores, but not this nipple. My daughter won't use any other pacis."
"This pacifier had all the features I was looking for; solid one piece construction, European country of origin, and all natural materials. Not to mention my daughter loves it. Only con is it is silent when it hits the floor making it hard to find sometimes."
"There is nothing wrong with this product, but our baby preferred another brand. They were even shaped the same, so I'm not sure why it made a difference"
"My son has been drooling and chewing all over the other straps I've purchased, making them dingy and gross. These don't show dirt & grim as bad. They seem like they will hold up over time, too!"
This is the only pacifier my baby will take.  If other people had problems with it - we have not experienced any.
My son absolutly loves this and wont use any other passie !!!<br />No Complaints !!!<br />No Regrets !<br />It is made well !
"my grandson had colic really bad and screamed all night.  bought him this, and while they rocked him at night he listend to the little sheep.  well made, soft, very nice."
"i have a new dog who was a puppy mill mother... she has accidents as while living in a cage<br />for all her years she never left foot outside her cage, therefore, never learned to go potty<br />outside.  i use this to put on my couch in case of accidents.  yes this is a chance to try and<br />get the word out on how horrible conditions are for dogs breeding in puppy mills.  please<br />educate yourself on how to avoid buying a puppy that has came from these horrible places."
my son was having meltdowns every time we had to put him in the back of the car. this helped relax him and worked wonders! he has learned to push the buttons himself now and he loves hearing the changing sounds.
my daughter is a little wwe diva in training. she is absolutly brutal when it comes to her toys and this thing really stands up to the abuse. love it!
"My daughter has become a pacifier snob. She is not happy unless she has a Gumdrop pacifier. I have tried other pacifiers that I was given as gifts, but she won't accept them."
I like this pacifier pod because it matches the bag I purchased form JJ Cole.  I look forward to using it.
"Avent is the brand I have used with my two kids, the third is on the way and I didnt doubt keeping working with Avent."
"i was in a bad accident and my arm had broken, i was in a coma and my arm didn't heal right and brakes can leave body parts extra chilly in cold weather... i don't like having to wear long sleves so i got toddler leg warmers top wear on my arms and they really help!"
it is soft and the curve is designed so well that it won't spill. i use this all the time to feed my little one.
me encanta este producto y todo entregado en el momento acordado satisfactorio la compra y el envio recomendado totalmente buen vendedor
"i know this set is meant for kids, but i bought them for movie snack time. the smaller size will help in portion sizing."
wish we had figured this out sooner.  pack and play without a mattress is like sleeping on the ground.  she sleeps all night now.
"a friend turned me on to these scissors, and i'm so grateful. they make nail-cutting so much less terrifying. i'll be buying these for all the new parents i know."
"no leaks, no leftover meds left behind. i couldnt believe it worked but it did. my son takes prilosec 2x a day. its DARK PURPLE and impossible to get him to take via syringe alone. we would give him a tenth of a milliliter at a time and pop his pacifier back in so he'd suck it down.  it took forever and he'd always  spit some of it out. (purple stains on everything he owns) we tried this and were shocked that it worked. he sucked down the meds in 2 seconds and didnt notice!"
"If you look at your hospital soothie and go to the website, it redirects to Philips, and this is the same product.  Less time hunting on the floor or between cushions (for now)"
"I bought a couple WubbaNubs and they really help the little one keep the pacifier in her mouth.  My little one isn't old enough yet to find the WubbaNub and put it back in her mouth at night, but we find it helps when riding in her car seat, sitting in her swing or laying on the floor.  I definitely recommend this item."
BPA free is a must.  Also one piece is a huge benefit.  Nothing gets nasty.  Buy at least three of them though.  Your child won't want another paci after she/he has this.  The only paci I would let my kids put near their mouths.
"These have been a total lifesaver for us! Our daughter got her first pacifier from the hospital where she was born, she has never taken to any other brand other than the soothie's, She had the worst time keeping it in her mouth and these have been amazing! They have now become her lovies and she can't be without them. It may be hard for her to give them up when we need to wean her from the binky. I HIGHLY recommend these to every new Mom."
"My baby cant use it yet since her mouth is so small, but I have had one before with my son when he was a baby... Can't wait to see her with it..."
My baby loves this pacifier.<br />She refuses all other brands.<br />They have different colors so I know which one I have washed recently and I switch them out on a regular basis.
"it's good!<br />that is small and it is very cute.<br />and my son likes.<br />anyway, the length are too short."
this was a gift for my grandson. it was on a wish list. his parents like to read to him. he also has a captain calamary toy.
this monster lovie is one of my daughter's favorites!  she must have her &#34;mon-ser&#34; when she goes to sleep every night!
"I got this as one of the gifts at a baby shower I went to and it was the hit of the party,"
i looked all over for a base that had the level on it.  thank goodness we found them on here! :) we bought 2 extras - one for ganny's car and one for daddy's car!
i bought this pink color summer training cup when my daughter was  2 years old. she loves it. now i am finding hard to change her bottle from training cup to sippy cup.
"that was the only one pacyfier for my douther, she didn't use any difrent because their felt from her mouth she used the one from 0-6 months, so i keep going with that one<br />love it"
"This type of pacifier is the only one our baby would suck on. If you've ever used this pacifier though, you know that it has a tendency to fall out....a lot. The little toy can be set on the child's stomach and provides enough stability that it keeps the pacifier in his mouth. The only drawback is that you can't sterilize the pacifier because of the toy, you can only hand wash the pacifier part with soap."
Let me start out by saying we are not a big pacifier house.  However...we do use them until our babies are about 3 months.  We bought these to have a few extras around the house.  They are the same as the ones they use at the hospital.
These are the only pacifiers my breastfed son will take.  I think the shape is easier for breastfed babies' mouths to make the transition.
"Our baby is breastfeeding and had found his hands so we were afraid he wouldn't take a soother, or it may interfere with feeding....but he took it immediately and loves it, plus he is still feeding like a champ! He doesn't drool as much with these ones as the orthodontic shape, and its pretty cool that you can see in his mouth as he sucks because the back is open."
"My daughter absolutely loves this little monkey who we call George.  It has been her best buddy since she was about 4 months old and she's now 13 months. She does not care about any other pacifier except for this one and never has. If a baby could be addicted to something, our is addicted to George!  For those looking for a way to wash, I just throw him into the washing machine in a lingerie bag with the rest of her clothes and let him air dry.  My only concern is how we'll ever wean her off of him because this is definitely her lovey!"
"just what i imagined it would be. wife thought the tote would be larger, but she failed to look at the dimensions in the description, so go figure."
Used for all three kids. No problems. We bought age specific ones as they aged. We trusted them because of the design.
"Minha filha comprou para os bebes que vao nascer. Foi indicado por varias pessoas,inclusive aqui no proprio Amazon. Ela vai usar quando os bebes nascerem se for preciso."
Baby loves it! It gives her something to hold on to and helps me to find her paci while I'm up front in car
"My daughter loves these.  I mean LOVES these!  If they get dirty I throw them in the wash animal and all and they have not fallen apart yet.  My daughter loves looking at them, holding them and of course putting them in her mouth.  She can find them easily in her crib at night.  I don't leave home without one.  She smiles when she sees it.  :)"
"This is just what we were hoping for, a boy version of the cow! Weighted legs, a very soft plush body and even cuter in person."
My daughter loves the caterpillar.  She can't wait to give it to my granddaughter.  The caterpillar design has sparked an entire theme of butterflies and caterpillars for my granddaughter's scrapbook.
i use these liners all the time for my little one and they are a life saver for babies with gas!
"it took a few trys but once my baby took to it, it was a life saver. i bought a second one for the living room."
"have also other wide nipples (dr brown, avent, etc) but found this will not fit dr brown, but do 'kinda' work on avent--"
My friend is the owner of this item so I ordered one for my stepsister who just had a baby.
no complaints. these work just like they are supposed to! we bought them for a trip to disney so baby brother wouldn't loose his toys while in the stroller.
"came as described, i can not complain about anything.  it works well with my medela pump and attaches to the model i bought."
a little on the expensive side but well worth the money when you consider the cargo.....love the fact that you can spend the time to properly set the base and easily take the car seat in and out.....great value....
"my daughter wore these for a very long time and i haven't seen any wear and tear on them what so ever. even after a year later they are still in great shape, i am sad that she outgrew these!!"
"i bought the 6-18 month after i heard my baby screaming and had the 0-6 month stuck sideways in his mouth.  i like the design on these also and they are hard to find with out the clear back, which i do not care for at all.  they have been durable and these are the only ones i plan to use."
i just wish they were made of a thicker material cause my kids chew on them and then they break
"My nephew wasn't liking any of the pacifiers they tried, I got these for him and he loves them! Now that he's 7 months he still uses them as teethers."
the base for the snug ride was very difficult to find in the store and that is why i used them and it worked out. great price too
I would recommed this to any mom that is looking for there babies. My son has two and loves them!
"I gave this to my newborn nephew since his mom was always losing his pacifier, now its always there to be found"
My son and i both prefer these pacifiers to others we have tried because my son likes shorter styles of pacifiers and i like them as they do create less gas for baby when sucking
"I initially purchased one of these for my nephew as part of his Easter basket and he looooves it so much.  Unfortunately he dropped it at the store and it was never found, so Auntie came to the rescue and purchased another one for him and it arrived on time. Thanks!"
I bought this for my newborn granddaughter last year.  It helped to sooth her to sleep so well that I ordered another one last month as a shower gift.
This is the only type of pacifier our baby will take so far. The hospital only gave us one and I was afraid we'd lose it so we ordered this 2 pack :)
"Some babies can be so fussy about pacifiers, but my baby never refused one of these.  She uses Playtex pacifiers everyday.<br /><br />At daycare she has this one with a handle because they hang them up on a little hook when she's not napping.<br />At night I kind of prefer the ones without the handle...cuz she can tend to play around with it, dangle it out of her crib, etc.<br /><br />Nice to have both options in my opinion, and plus you'll need at least 4 in rotation...there's always one missing, in the other room, hiding underneath the crib, in the carseat, etc."
I bought these for my lil son before he was born and he loves them! They are a life saver!!!!
I thought parents were crazy when they raved about the wubbanubs but they are a lifesaver and a must have!
My child would only take soothies but they bounced and rolled so we were always searching for one these land and don't roll!
I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for one of the best baby gifts ever!!! It is practically impossible to lose this pacifier!!
"Not sure what we would do without them. The store bought pacifiers just do not cut it with him, he loves these ones though."
I did not want to use pacifiers however the NICU gave these to my daughter. She loves them and this is the only pacifier type she will not spit out.
"i did a lot of research before buying this carrier. i have a bad back and was worried about having an uncomfortable carrier. i haven't quite got the positioning of my 6 week old perfected and sometimes he doesn't enjoy it (i think because of the positioning (once he had his nose against my chest and couldn't breathe and got really upset)), but the carrier is very comfortable and once he gets a little bigger (he was a 5 1/2 pound baby), i think it will work really well. i would recommend this carrier but just to be careful that a baby's nose is not pressed against your chest."
i previously had a set of rubber bath ducks with the holes in the bottom and unfortunately they molded. i decided i didn't want to deal with buying another set and having to glue the bottoms closed. i purchased this set and my daughter loves them! also in the future it will give me an excuse to teach her letters and numbers while taking a bath. as of right now she just loves sticking them all over the bath walls and herself and no mold! yay!
"the item is just as i thought it would be, i haven't tried it out yet because baby isn't here but it will get tried out soon!"
this straw cup is a life saver (as with other nuk sippys). it is the only straw cup i can find that doesn't leak! my daughter was very ready to transition from a rubber sippy cup to a straw cup but all the ones i would find in the store leaked like crazy. i finally found these on amazon and decided to give them a try. i've since bought many more. it is almost impossible to find them in stores near me as they are always sold out so i snatch them up whenever i can.
"i have tried at least 4 other pacis and my daughter only likes this one. i don't know what it is about it, but she loves it."
"We got one of these pacifiers at the hospital. I was hesitant to give my newborn a pacifier since we were exclusively nursing but it helps him because he likes to comfort nurse for 20 minutes beyond feeding. We've had no issues with nipple confusion, the pacifiers are sturdy, and the lip on them helps with cleaning and retrieving without touch the part that goes in the baby's mouth."
"i walk my dog and have to take my kids out with me in the stroller every day unless it's pouring rain. i have two of these and i feel they really save me at least 20 minutes if not more every day. with the bundleme, i don't have to spend time getting coats, gloves, hats, shoes, socks for both kids and then strapping them in the stroller. i just plop them in the bundleme in whatever they were wearing inside (usually just one layer of clothing). they are so comfy on our walks, they just fall right asleep. i live in maryland and it does get cold here so i opted for the arctic version and i have no regrets."
After searching everywhere and ordering wrong flat tip nuk ones I nailed it. I ordered two packs and got luck the colors where 3 greens and 1 blue thank god since I have a boy I was afraid of getting a girl colored one. I think what helped amazon sort out the right colors was I also included in my order a pacifier clip with the colors green and blue so they probably matched it. Keep that in mind if u order these pacifiers since you can't choose the colors order something else with them with the color gender of you child it might help the person who's picking out your items in wear house. It helped in my case. Thank you amazon.
"I was anti-pacifer. Then I had my baby. Amazing how things change!<br /><br />My son is about a month old and has reflux, which is apparently really common in newborns. Suckling helps the reflux - which means he was nursing constantly - CONSTANTLY. Sometimes 3 to 4 hours in one session. Now that he is back up to birth weight, he was given the clearance for pacifers and bottles. This is the only pacifer that he took to - and it has saved my sanity. Probably his, too. Now that he's not getting a constant supply of milk, his number of spit ups has decreased. But he is still suckling, which helps the reflux. And he's not suckling on me, which gives my body a chance to recuperate. He flat out rejected other pacifers, except this one. I also like that it has the finger hole - I can hold his head with one hand and still have a finger in/on the binky to help hold it in place, and still have another hand free.<br /><br />Buy one pack. If your baby likes it, too, then load up!"
"My son doesn't like pacifiers, but when he does want one the only one he will take is the Dr. Brown's pacifier.  They are small enough for newborns to take.  The only downside is that you can't choose what color you get."
"My daughter loves the soothie binky's and this duck is our third wubbanub paci that we have ordered (we have the lamb and blue bear as well). The only complaint I have with this one, is it doesn't seem to be stuffed very well, and is rather floppy compared with the lamb and bear.<br /><br />Get TONS of compliments on these, and my daughter's day care always knows which Binky is her's without having to label it!"
my grandbaby just loves these little things... we have ordered her 3 and i dont think she would want anything else
our son loves this soothie! its the only thing he will use. he gags when we tired to give him the other kind of pacifier (he's so dramatic). he just loves it.
I really like Avent products. The only bad part about this pacifier is that it gets water into the nipple when it's cleaned. After repeated washings all this water turns the inside of the nipple cloudy. I have only used avent pacifiers so I don't know if this is common with all pacifiers.
"My title says it all.  This is better than any of the other ones out there, especially if you have a toddler that's always trying to figure out how to take things apart. My little one is obsessed! Thank you to who made this!!!  We use nuk, natursutten, and dr browns with this guy.  Only problem, where can we buy a pink one!!???"
i bought these as extras and they give me peace of mind that i will never have a delay in using the breast pump.
"excelente producto, exacto al que ofrecen, lo esperado, adaptado para el bebe, colores estupendos, tamao muy acorde, llegada muy rapida."
"yes, the other reviews are correct that the toy received is not exactly as pictured. instead my panda is in the middle and the pattern is slightly different, but all in all, it's the same. my son loves playing with this blankie and likes holding onto the panda. i bought one for my friend's baby too because i like it so much!"
"A must have!  We have several of these attached to everything from our stroller, to our baby carriers, to shopping carts/high chairs.  Our son seems to be determined to throw his toys everywhere so these are invaluable to us.  We use them not only on toys, but also on snack cups and anything it will latch on to."
we tried several different door locks to keep our 2year old inside.  this was the only one that she couldn't figure out!  you won't be disappointed!
"These are the cutest things, and trust me after 3 brothers she is definitely the Princess. The pacifier just helps everyone else to know she is the Princess."
"Our son is exclusively breastfed and I was concerned about giving him a pacifier. We waiter a few weeks after birth and tried the Soothie. He took to it immediately and now uses it to fall asleep for naps.<br /><br />Since buying it, I've tried introducing other pacifiers. Nope, no go. Only Soothie will do."
"These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take, and they are hard to find nowadays. You don't get to choose specific colors, but who cares? Your baby couldn't care less about what color their sucky is, but if you're the type who gets butt-hurt if you don't get everything the same color or if your boy has a pink paci, look elsewhere!"
Very funny...my nephew loves to walk with this pacifier around and besides it is very hard so it doesn't break.
"the pacifier box really worst money,it can fill 2 pacifier, the handle u can put on the stroller, car seat or on diaper bags. it make pacifier clean"
These are the same binkies that the hospital gives the newborns. Needless to say that my baby took well to them. She loves them!!
We have a couple of these and our daughter loves them! We actually snipped the pacifier point off of one so she couldn't suck on it but could still hold the little animal for comfort. It has also improved her hand eye coordination because she has to hold on to the animal to get the pacifier in her mouth.
"This is the cutest little pacifiers ever!!!  If you a fan of monkeys, this is a must have! My new little grandson is going to love it."
"Although my son, is NOT a lover of pacifiers, when he is overtired, worked up, and/or teething . . this is the only pacifier he will take. It is a blessing that there are other items out there, that can give me a break from nursing."
my son was ready to move out of his britax diplomat which we hated.  we had almost lost confidence in britax because his previous seat was so bad. but after reading all of the reviews we decided that we would give the frontier 85 a chance.  we are so glad we did! so much easier to install than the diplomat.  regardless of how we positioned it we could never get the diplomat to feel truly secure. the frontier is snug as can be!  so glad we spent the money on it! the only complaint i have is my 2.5 year old is very active and in the process of climbing in his seat the cover always seems to come off in some way or another. but this is minor as it doesn't affect the safety of the carseat.
"had no problems with installation.  perhaps 20 mins.  software is as advertised. no bells and whistles, just a monitor for ios that works.  going to get a 2nd one.<br /><br />bought a 2nd one.  again no problems whatsoever. i can toggle between the cameras with the software by two finger swiping.  ez."
"My babe loves these pacifiers anyway... but one day my husband says, someone should invent glow in the dark pacifiers Presto! Amazon finds it!"
baby loves them and mom does to. they wash well in the dishwasher. they also stand up to the baby chowing on them
"I did get the product I ordered so I can only assume the people that didn't ordered from a different vender or got confused and ordered the wrong product. That being said, this thing IS sold as a novelty and for the reason I took that into consideration during my review. This thing is too cute, the nipple is too large for a new born but should be usable after about 6-9 months. There is no ring or ledge for removal from a baby's mouth or to attach a pacy clip to. This shouldn't be a big deal because this should probably only be used under CLOSE supervision due to the nipple size, weight and materials used. Let's face it, though it can be used by a child it doesn't look like usability was the main goal when making this. Laughter was. It's built well and will work. If your baby doesn't like the nipple on the pacy try pulling the face off of this pacy can gluing it onto another one."
"These pacifiers are great, especially for little babies.  Our son didn't quite have the ability to keep a pacifier in his mouth for any real length of time until he was several months old.  If you put this pacifier in his mouth with the animal on his stomach, the pacifier won't fall out if baby loses suction for a second.  It keeps me from putting the pacifier back in his mouth every few seconds and has taught him how to keep the pacifier in his mouth.  We tried pacifiers without a stuffed animal attached, but they fell out of his mouth almost immediately when he was just a few months old.  We also tried Pacimals when he was small, but the angle is all wrong for a newborn."
"Vendedor cumpli con la entrega y expectativas del producto!! Vienen en paquete de dos, son los mjores pacificadores del mercado!!!"
"My third daughter would NOT take a regular pacifier! I tried them all. Then my friend told me about the Vanilla Scented Gubdrop Pacifiers and I tried them out. My baby loves them. They are sort of hard to find. You can get them on Amazon or straight from the manufacturer in bulk. I just got mine from Amazon (its easier). The review that said they are pricey is crazy. I think these ones are less expensive that the traditional pacifier you can get at Target, and those ones dont smell like vanilla. The only down side is that they do smell like vanilla and your dog may want to eat it. Mine doesn't but he was interested at first. Its just a thought. Great Pacifier!"
"These are the only pacifiers either of my sons would use, they are great!I would buy them again & again"
These are the only pacifiers we trust with our baby. While the cost is questionable...the ingredients to make the pacifiers are top notch and are devoid of dangerous chemicals (such as BPA). They last on average about 2 months for us.
"linda cartera de hannah montana para las nias, llego a buen tiempo y a buen precio a mi sobrina le va a entantar como regalo de navidad"
"my daughter loves this thing. she carries it around by the handle and enjoys her snacks all over the place--in the car, in the stroller, in the grocery store, etc. the only snacks i have to pick up are the ones she drops from her hand, not the ones she dumps out of the cup because those don't exist--yay!"
my daughter loves these rings. we took them apart & made numerous rings w/ just 2-3 rings each. she loves to chew on them.
"I don't know why by my daughter loves these, and only these.  I do have to say that compared to some other pacifiers these are odorless.  Quite a few others we tried smelt like rubber, even after boiling."
I bought these after seeing that my newborn kept spitting out her pacifier(that is shaped like a bulb) because my sister in law used it with her kid and it works like magic but unfortunately my baby was used to the other paci even though she kept spitting it out and when I kept giving her this one she would just look up at me and scrunch her face. Otherwise it came just like described.
My son wouldn't take any pacifier until I tried the Wubbanub. It definitely soothes him to the point he falls asleep.
"i had purchased some mam paci's for my son and within 2 weeks, he had holes in both of them at the base. when i contacted mam, they said i needed to use the diamond paci's which were designed for teethers. i had a hard time finding them in stores and was thrilled when i found them on amazon. the only negative is you can't choose the color."
"There is something about these pacifiers that seem similar to the old Playtex pacifiers that I used for my daughters. When my daughter had my grandson, they were the only one he would take. They used to be carried by Babies R us, but for some reason they stopped carrying them, which led to a massive web search and alas, we found them on Amazon."
"I bought this for my 1 year old's nap time at daycare.  I like the padded mat part since they have hard floors.  I've washed it at least three times and have noticed the fleece pilling but overall for the price and what he uses it for, I think I'd buy it again.  My little guy loves the tractor theme:)"
I am a nurse and this is the paci that is used in many of the hospitals I have worked in and this was the paci of choice at the hospial my twins were born in. The paci did not deter my twins from breastfeeding and it does not leave those awful marks on their faces that some of the other pacifiers do. This is the ONLY paci I will use and have two in every room of my home and 4-6 of them in my diaper bag!!!!
"I have been using these since my now 3yr old was born. They last a long time and don't get all gross like some other brands from daily use. If you get water inside them, they will squeak when baby sucks it and get gross. So I always dip the nipple in water then wipe it clean. Also you will need to clean around the base of the nipple part where it attaches to the hard plastic. There can be buildup of milk, formula, food, etc. you will want to clean out. Again, just dip the nipple part under hot water then use your fingernail or a towel to wipe the buildup away from the base. DO NOT SUBMERGE - or it will squeak when baby uses it (which kept mine awake bc of the noise it made) and grow all kind of nasty mold inside the nipple. Just dip it into hot water. I would check about using the microwave bag for sterilizing - not sure if these are rated for that."
We tried different styles and brands before and she didnt like them. But she likes this a lot. It works so she stops crying when there is nothing else to do.
"i highly recommend this mattress if you buy a porta-crib because the mattress that comes with a porta-crib is thin, flimsy and seems uncomfortable (and too soft if you want to prevent sids). i am using the portacrib as a regular crib because i have to squeeze two kids into one room until we sell our house, so i wanted a decent mattress. babies r us sells portacrib sheets (koala baby brand) that fit it, too."
"i purchased these blocks to make the learning toy found on the mama jenn blog. ([...], click on education cubes link)   basically you print out her premade inserts of letters, numbers, sight words, etc and insert them into the block instead of photos. i can use these for all kinds of learning games with all three of my homeschooling children."
"[[asin:b002kar786 nuk silicone orthodontic nipples, slow flow, size 1, 2 pack]]  i feed my baby breast milk (medela pumping) and similac advance newborn (ready to feed, 2-fluid ounces). i was using the disposable nipple from similac for the medela bottle, too, but it was too wasted. so i was looking for a nipple fits to the similac ring (i'm not sure this is medela narrow or wide size ring.), and has slow flow.   this nuk nipple fits perfectly to the similac ring. i removed the disposable nipple from the ring and inserted the nuk nipple. perfect! my baby sucks this nipple as she sucks breast milk. it is definitely slow flow."
"My daughter loves her elephant.  She can handle it on her own and likes to chew on the stuffed part while holding the pacifier part.  It makes it easier to find in her carseat when she drops it which makes car rides quieter.  It's a little expensive, but I would buy another one for the ease of finding it when she drops it.  If your child likes the soothie pacifiers, I would recommend this."
"This item was for my grandson. He lives on the other side of the country. I have no personal experience with him and the teether. However, I am told that he loves it."
This was the only pacifier my son would take.  And I like it because it is rubber and he just chews all over it now and I don't have to worry about hard plastic hurting his gums.
My baby loves these pacifiers and kids get a kick out of watching him suck on it because they can see the inside of his mouth.
I've try over 7 different pacifier in the last few months and this is the only one my daughter takes.
"I use these interchangeably with the Soothie. Only small difference is that baby gets these turned sideways when he sleeps and can't keep it in his mouth that way sometimes. So we use soothie in the crib (they are difficult to find a pacifier clip for anyway), and Gum drop around the house and for travel."
I bought these for a friend and she told me that her son preferred these over all of the others she received for her baby shower.
"Oh yeah, these are a winner.    We just run them thru the dishwasher every now and then   on the sanitizing cycle.  Works like a charm."
"I'm not sure who loves this Wubby the best...me or my baby daughter.  The weight of the kitty cat helps keep the pacifier from falling out, which allows me some interruption-free sleep at night.    Now that she is a little older (almost 4 months), she likes to play with it, and strokes her hands over it while she is sucking the pacifier.  When it does fall out of her mouth, she tries to put it back in, although at this point she usually ends up sucking on a leg or tail instead.  :)  This little guy might seem a tad expensive for what it is, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat if this one got lost.    The kitty cat is very well sewn.  My baby tugs and pulls at the legs, and the stitching is holding up perfectly.  I'm not sure exactly how the Soothie pacifier is attached, but it is still attached after about 3 months of use.  I've also tossed it in the washing machine a couple of times (in a mesh bag) and drip dried it."
My little guy LOVES this pacifier.  He's just learning to suck and gets frustrated when his paci falls out and this helps him keep it in! Great product!
"After Gerber changed their latex pacifiers with the rounded ends, I went through literally pacifier after pacifier trying to find one my son would take so I could get some sleep.  These are absolutely the only ones he will take.  The only bad thing about them is they are VERY expensive.  However, it's worth it to get a good night's sleep."
I bought a different brand pacifier pocket first and it did not zip closed and I was always loosing pacifiers and they were getting dirty because the design of the pocket was awful.  Now that I have this one I am much happier!  I can fit two pacifiers in it and zip it closed.  I will be ordering another one - as you can't have enough of these for clean and secure pacifier storage!
This is the only pacifier my daughter will take.  It is a life saver.
I love it for my daughter. She gets to cuddle the monkey while sucking on her binkie. It also helps when ever it drops it doesn't always land on the nipple side and gets dirty.
we bought this to keep a distance between our two-year-old and the christmas tree.  we anchored it with furniture on both ends and it has served its purpose well.  she can push on it but not enough to be a problem.  i'm thinking of using it on the deck later and we can see all kinds of uses for it.
"this car seat base does what it's supposed to do - hold the carseat in place.  it's got built-in leveling bubbles to assist with proper install.  it can be installed via latch, lap belt, or shoulder/lap belt.  i've tried all 3 and had no issues.  what more can i say?  if you have a chicco keyfit or keyfit 30, this is a great additional base."
"I bought a 2-pack of these, and they became the de-facto pacifiers for my girl. They are virtually indestructible!"
"My infant will only use this pacifier, and I routinely recommend it to parents who have tried other pacifiers and their child doesn't not take to them. I like that the pacifier is all in one piece and that there aren't any hard parts to be uncomfortably places if lost in bed or the car seat. This pacifier does not leave marks on the face, and the cut out makes it so the child's nose isn't covered.    This pacifier is difficult to find in retail stores, but can be ordered in bulk from the supplier. My only complaint about this pacifier is that ordinary pacifier clips do not work with this pacifier."
[[VIDEOID:24606481]]A two-sided review
"exactly what i was looking for - not available in stores as a simply, \\snoogle\\ cover. it has to have the leachco name on it - not available at target near me or babies 'r' us."
Perfect match for the Gund Huggybuddy I bought as a baby gift.
My little girl love this paci contraption!
Perfect
Amazing addition to the nursery!
"Great, breathable, and basic pacifier."
Great pacifiers
Baby boy loves it and like to just hold the giraffe.  Happy kid = happy parents
"We love the NUK brand of bottles and pacifiers and these pacifiers are no exception! These are the only brand my kiddos would take. With how easy these can be to lose, this 4 pack is so worth buying! The colors are exactly as pictured. Would recommend buying the pacifiers and bottles together because baby recognizes the nipple and will take them easier. Love the othodonic shape - its more natural to breastfed babies and I don't have to worry about teeth problems. Would definitely recommend this product!"
went well with the baby one-piece tuxedo. excellent
"Perfect, love!"
These are the only type of pacifier that my baby will take! They stay in his mouth really well compared to other brands we tried. He loves them.
Very Cute
Love these! The shape of them allows my daughter to get a good suction and they stay in her mouth!
good
"this is hands down the best baby monitor on the market. we've had it for 9 months with no problems.<br />the camera can move side to side and even zoom. there is a microphone so you can speak to your baby if you want to.<br />the screen can time out, lighten or darken, and you can use more than one monitor while using 1 screen. we have also dropped this screen on multiple occasions and it has survived with no scratches.<br />this is the monitor you will want."
"easy to use, easy for baby to grasp, handy for teething and for dangling toys from play gyms, etc."
excellent product - sticks easier than any others i've tried!
this bin is adorable and heavy duty. its not hard sided and will fold in if you lean on it. holds a lot of toys.
"we're very happy with this cup. my 8 month old dislikes all bottles and barely drinks from other sippy cups, but she drinks pretty well from this. easy to clean and very cute."
bought this as a gift but have used chicco for my daughter and will for son. super easy to use and love the safety stats on these as well!!!
i am so very impressed! my order was fulfilled through amazon and they goofed with one of the 4 items. i contacted the seller and they went above and beyond what i would have expected to fix the issue. because of this amazing service and beautiful quality - i will find a reason to shop this seller as often as possible. i'm thankful i found her! good prices and quality items.
wonderful product!
"love these bibs. soft, cute sayings, and do a great job!!!"
this is in my son's room and he loves it. we have it hanging lower so that he can reach it and put his animals in and out by himself. it is a good quality and is lasting us for a long time. it is great for keeping stuffed animals off of the floor.
love it
None available.
"we have three big dogs and wanted to keep them out of some of the rooms. the entrance to that part of the house is quite wide and we looked at several options, including one ourselves. this has been a very affordable solution, it was very easy to install, and it is easy to open and close."
"perfect for taking around town and everywhere we go while potty training. well, my daughter is a champ, what can i say, but this has been helpful keeping her on track."
"pushes easy. much upgrades since older models, fits key fit 30 chicco. padded seats, better buckles, 3 year old loves it! great product, swivel wheel is a must, spend the extra. folds good to fit in van."
loved them
Girlfriend loved it.
"I LOVE WubbaNubs. &#34;Giraffee&#34; is one of my daughters favorite ones. WubbaNub's are perfect for babies. Once they can grab, the animal makes it so easy for the baby to find and stick back in their own mouth due to its size. This is nice because when they wake up in the middle of the night they can grab it and reassert it. Helps the baby to soothe themselves and fall right back to sleep. Plus they are absolutely adorable! Now that my daughter is older she loves to babble at her giraffe. They also can chew on different parts of the animal/noonie.<br /><br />I wash my daughters every other day in the washing machine and leave it to air dry! Super easy to clean!"
Our daughter loves her frog so much that we now have two of them.  This is great because if she wakes up in the middle of the night and wants her pacifier she can easily grab it herself!
Excellent
"My infant loves these. They are high-quality material and the nipple fit in my daughter's mouth when she was only a few days old. She's still using them at 7 weeks and will probably continue until she graduates to the larger size. They seem a little pricey, but I am willing to pay a higher price for NUK products."
"Good product, as described. Arrived on time"
These arrived yesterday and I'm so excited! Our daughter spits her pacifiers out between rooms at night and I find myself frantically searching the dark floor. I set them under a lamp for a few minutes and it was still glowing when I went t check on her hours later. Very happy with this purchase!
Bought one because I heard good things about it. My son loves it! I'll be buying more in the future!
These are our favorite pacifiers and I will continue to buy them for my own babies as well as gifts for others.
"All I have to say is wow for both the product and the seller my baby girl loves these and while there was a tiny misunderstanding which wasn't even that big of a deal this seller went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.<br /><br />Thanks,"
"These pacifiers are compact, orthodontic, and my son took to them instantly. I also love the carrying case that can be used to sterilize the pacifiers in the microwave.<br /><br />I wish they glowed a little more brightly and for a longer time (they lose their glow after ~thirty minutes or so), but it's not a huge issue."
The best
The only binky we've been able to get the little one to take!
"Came fast, item just as described."
Our grandson started on this binkie while still in the NICU. The monkey's weight keeps it pretty much in place - and because of its size it hasn't been misplaced or lost.
"We have tried several other brands of natural pacifiers and this one is our favorite. It seems to be of the highest quality, smell the least weird (though they all smell weird when brand new), and have the best shape. In fact, this is the only one I have bought more than one of and I will continue to do so as needed. Stay away from natursutten- the nipple sticks to the outer ring making baby really frustrated when they go to put the paci in their mouth."
hilarious. who doesn't love a baby with a mustache.
my 9 month old loves this. she loves it so much that she will hold still for me while i change her diaper if she's holding it. it basically doubles as a teether. the design prevents choking. what a great product.
i am extremely happy with the hippo organizer. it is the third organizer i am buying and finely this one is just perfect. my son loves it too.
these are perfect for messy eaters as well as arts and crafts
"it might seem silly to spend money on baby spoons, but these are absolutely worth it. they are easy to use, easy to clean, colorful, and safe. furthermore, there customer service is absolutely top notch with prompt email responses and follow through. best spoons with best service, whats not to like!"
"huge bag! it can fit several large beach towels and the pockets are gigantic. i bought this as a diaper bag but it is a little large for that purpose, nonetheless, it is my go to family bag where i can stick my purse or the diaper bag in it and some towels or snacks and water bottles. it stands up on its own which is a plus! the fabric is durable and the side mesh pockets are super. there is a zipper on top. i would recommend this bag to anyone needing a family bag for all the essentials."
love this!  super durable (my 5yo son thrashes everything!) and easy to wipe clean.  going to buy another one for the in-laws house.
fantastic coverage of granddaughters eyes. i brought them into my shop to test them (licensed optician) and they pass uv and light transfer. buying for my other granddaughter and my nephew.
works great
i love how many toys this net holds! we probably have 40 stuffed animals hanging in this net. easy and quick to install.
Made diaper changes a breeze. Amazing product.
Great!
We love these binkies! They glow in the dark which is great. I would note that they won't keep their glow all night long but they do for most of the night. We keep a few of these in a bowl on the dresser so that I can just grab another one if the first one is &#34;lost&#34; in the bed at night. I would recommend this product.
My son (3 mos old) loves these and everyone gets a kick out of seeing him with them in his mouth!  They're a hoot!  Just as durable as any other pacifier we use.
My son loves these! I had gotten the I love daddy ones at the store and was so excited to see the had the I love mommy ones too!! Now we secretly slip one or the other in his mouth as a friendly competition!!!
"This is the only pacifier my daughter will take (and we tried seven different kinds!). The nipple on this pacifier seems to be a little shorter/smaller than other pacifiers, which I think is part of the reason she prefers it. It seems very sturdy and is made in the USA, which I really appreciate! If you have tried other pacifiers and your child won't take them, it is worth giving Jollypop a try. Important to note-- I cannot find this in any stores near me, so online ordering may be your only option."
Bought this to go with infant tux for a wedding.  Little guy was a real hit.  Took lots of pictures to remember.
Can't say enough good things about the WubbaNub - wish it had a clasp to attach to clothing
Most pacifiers gave my newborn a rash.  These worked great with no rash.
Baby loved them.  They don't cause rashes.  Best part:  easy to find at night without turning on the light!
"This cute lil puppy paci has prompted so many adorable pictures. I bought this after having to put paci's back in baby's mouth when they fell out way too many times in a row. I thought this would be a better alternative because the puppy could sit on her chest while the paci is in her mouth. It does exactly that. Granted, it's not heavy so it can be knocked off, but I wouldn't want it to be heavy. ;) Love it!"
The only paci my little one is willing to accept.
Love the glowing part in the night. Very useful in order not to wake up my little guy.
Thank you...! I received it today! Really cute...
"These are a little pricey, the gave one to my son while he was in the NICU at UCSF and he loved it, it was easier to stay in his mouth, he doesn't really use a binky now but still plays with it and its a fun thing to have around."
We have several of these! My month old loves them and so do I because they're easy for him to find and put in his mouth.
"These pacifiers are gorgeous! I know that sounds silly but they really are. They are sparkly which is fantastic for anyones little princess. I thought these were really cute in the picture but they are even better in person. These are by far my favorite pacifiers just for the pictures on them alone. All of the pacifiers we have in our house for our kiddos are Mam. We have tried many other pacifiers and none compare as far as quality, cuteness and the fact that my kids preferred them."
"Most parents know that not all babies will use just any pacifier.  My 9 month old has consistently preferred Avent pacifiers since he was a newborn.  We switched to the next biggest size at 8 months, and it took a little while for him to get used to it.  He uses both the smaller and the bigger sizes now.  I love the designs and different colors although I don't believe you can specify colors when you order through Amazon."
We love MAM in this house! I've used them exclusively with 3 kids now! Best out there!
We Love MAM!
Love it it's soft and easy for baby to hold on to
These are the best pacifiers for nighttime pacifier replacement. Glows all night after some exposure to light. Of course your baby has to like the MAM style but that's simply an issue of preference.
So cute
Our baby boy loves these. It's the same ones as the ones they provide in the hospitals. He doesn't like any other kind. It probably is because it's the most similar to a mothers breast? Not sure why. It is BPA free!
These were too big for my baby's mouth at first but by 3 months it is his pacifier of choice. My baby is breast fed and does not usually take a pacifier. But at night he will or if he needs soothing in the car and this one does the trick!
Love it
"I really like this particular brand of pacifiers. They are my son's favorite. This brand has pacifiers 0-3, 0-6 and 6+ but I did not know that initially and got a few packs of 0-3 as we lose them constantly. Now I would just get 0-6 and later 6+."
"Super cute, very soft and perfect size!"
A welcome invention. I'm taking care of my new baby Granddaughter and loving every minute. Didn't have these when raising my children and always looking for the pacifier. Wonderful
Love it when my son walks around the house with this binkie in his mouth :)
"These work well for my son. I don't think the shape is orthodontically approved, but really... would any pacifier be when you think about it? We like it. And i'm sure we will be reading every internet blog about how to get rid of these things any day now!!"
Our little one really likes both the bottles and the pacifiers in this set.  Plus the easy bottle sterilization system is fantastic.
"We cannot live without this for our 11 month old. It was perfect when he was younger and had trouble grasping small objects. Sometimes he doesn't even use the paci part of it, the monkey acts as enough of a &#34;security blanket&#34; for him.<br />When he was smaller, we also propped this up on his chest into his mouth when he is in his crib so it less likely to fall and roll away."
Great pacifiers. It's really nice that it's one piece and easy to disinfect and keep clean.
"I attached this to my baby's mobile above his crib when I was sleep training, and he never cried longer than 5 minutes. He wakes up, finds his binky and goes back to bed. It's changed my life. My baby is 6 months old. I did have it attached to his carseat for about a week or two so he learned how to use it before I used it in his crib."
"The case they come in acts as a sanitizer, which is a nice addition. You just fill with water to the level and microwave for 3 min. They are very sturdy and love the color/design for a baby boy. If you have an infant &#62; 6 months, I would strongly recommend checking this out."
So cute. Love it
"loved this, and loved that we had a game for the &#34;little&#34; girls to play at our baby shower"
Greats &#34;binks&#34;. Great price. These are the only brand my baby will use.
Great set. My son has colic and these seem to do the trick. Very happy.
Special wub for a special granddaughter :)
Just like the one from the hospital. Great price. One in each room of the house
Love wubbanubs!! Best pacifier for newborn babies as the animal holds the pacifier close to their mouth even when it pops out. Often my 6 week old can put it back in his own mouth when it pops out or I can grab it quickly since it stays against his chest. We have tried other pacifiers but he won't take any of them except this kind. So now we own five of them.  To clean them I just throw them in the washing machine with the baby clothes and they come out in good shape every time.
"We have had several of the wubbanub pacifiers over the last few years, and I believe this one (pink bear) is the softest. The wubbanub are great and very well loved. Even when outgrown as a pacifier, it has remained a very important stuffed animal during bedtime."
"Harder to lose, harder to drop.<br />Easier to cuddle, easier to love."
Wish it could be bigger! But still good product
Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)
"Not only is this adorable, it makes loosing a paci so much easier to find!"
Good price
Great baby shower present.
"My baby loves these! She will not tolerate the other types of pacifiers, she only likes these super suit is. I think it's because they more so mimic the shape of an actual nipple. They are great because they are actually cheaper than the other types of pacifiers as well. Use with a universal pacifier clip and you are good to go!"
"Soo in LuV with these..we just received the blue Okey dokey dino and the red dragon..we also have the monkey and giraffe. They are perfect for comforting, and binky doesn't get lost<br />Oh and free shipping was super fast..ordered on the 18th,  received on the 21st. We were supposed to get them between 24- 27,28."
Great
Huge wubanub fans!!
Products came quick and with no damage.
My baby loves these they don't slip out easily
"My older daughter loved these pacifiers. This one doesn't care much for them, but when I used them they were great."
Whoever thought of glow in the dark pacifiers is a genius. These are wonderful. If my son loses it in the night he can find it himself and go right back to sleep!
Both of my daughters love MAM pacis. And they are cute!
We have and will always use the soothies! Our babies have all loved them! Great item at an excellent price. Thank you.
"These are the best ones, My LO had Mam and Avent spacifiers, she liked them for a while then she never wants them again, I bought Dr.Brown pacifiers, It took a day or more for my baby to get used with these and then she loves it, its very easy and good for her"
"My daughter loves her wubbanub! She won't take any other pacifier. She will take the plain soothie pacifier on occasion, but usually spits it out. If i hand her her wubbanub, it calms her down most of the time. She loves holding onto it. The plush toy is so easy to wash too, so no big deal if it gets dirty. I have washed it several times now and it has held up perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase. I am buying more of these in different plush animals to have for her."
very good quarity.... price is very satisfaction
We love it
Best invention ever!
"i love these!  because really, wubbanubs and sophie the giraffe are waaaay to pricey to replace frequently. we haven't lost a nice toy yet in almost two years thanks to these!"
our one year old son loves it!
best sippy cup we've tried - and we have tried a lot...
sooo cute! nice and sold
awesome look!!!
very good
my son has really enjoyed this. people say they like the necklace and are usually very surprised to find that it's also a teething toy. we've been using it for a few months now and it has no signs of wear.
"so cute, but ran slightly large."
"i looked all over in stores for a pillow the right size for my son's bed, but couldn't find one anywhere. so, i turned to amazon and am so happy with the little sleepy head toddler pillow i ordered. it is sized just right for a toddler bed. i teach preschool, and i intend to recommend this product to the parents of my students for use during naptime. i agree with other reviewers' assessments of the customer service. i had no issue with my product, but received an email asking if i was completely satisfied. that was a first for me!"
works great.
it is good
"huge bubble guppies fan.  looooves this blanket.  as others have said, very soft and lightweight.  great blanket!"
"i love this diaper pail. it's simple and affordable, and the bag refills are also very affordable. i never intended to buy a diaper pail, even after all the hype over diaper genies and what not, because the cost was always so expensive. and for something you just throw poppy diapers in, i wasn't going to spend a small fortune. with my second child though, the garbage can in my bedroom started to smell so bad, i considered a diaper genie. as i was researching though a lot of great reviews came up for this diaper pail, and the price is unbeatable. i bought it, and i am very glad i did. it holds a good amount of diapers, is easy to change, and completely blocks out any odors. i 100% recommend this pail."
my son loves it. i bought this tooth brush just as his first tooth popped through. he now brushes his tooth with toothpaste every morning and night with mommy. makes for a easy task for my 7 month old while i brush my teeth.
My Lil Mermaid just loved a more &#34;Tween&#34; style Bedroom makeover...The instructions and quality of this wall decor was an awesome find !! I can't wait to try another decal on my other Granddaughter's room ...
Love them!
My infant twins love these! They love snuggling with the stuffed animal and I don't have to worry about them getting lost so easily.
These are amazing!!! They really do smell like vanilla and the scent lasts for a long time. Our daughter uses them at bed time and I feel that she sleeps better thanks to the soothing vanilla scent. We'll be ordering more of these soon! A must have for every mommy that plans on putting baby down with a binky!
"This review is based off one day's use. I got my sterilizer and dryer and immediately opened it. I previously washed about twenty bottles and put them in the sterilizer to use it right away. After four cycles of sterilizing and drying, I'm obsessed! I can't believe it how easy it works and how well it dries. There's nothing I dislike more than leaving wet bottles for days to dry on my counter. I hope this keeps working well as time goes on!"
My little man loves this pacifier! This is the only brand he will use. The large vent holes on the sides are great for him to get air but he also loves to stick his tongue out of the sides.
This pacifier has been great to use with my Grandaughter since her mom is breastfeeding. She had trouble breastfeeding after using other pacifiers. This one is our favorite especially since we are a cat family. She likes to hold onto one ear. So sweet!
good product
These are the only pacifiers my son will actually take; he loves them! They're the perfect sizes for infants.
"The glow in the dark feature is amazing! If you want it to glow bright for most of the night, hold it right up to a bright light bulb (desk lamp, or mirror lights in a bathroom work very well) for about 20 seconds. The Pacing will be so bright, there is no chance of losing it.    My son loves the fit of these Pacifiers!!"
Our 7 month old loves it! Super cute colors and really well made.
"Our favorite brand of pacifier hands down! We have tried Avent, Nuk, and various mustachifiers."
Bought the WubbaNub for our new baby grandson. Turns out he took right to it and loves it. What a find!
Super cheap for two pacifiers! And it was the exact type that the hospital gave us so we have back up if we were to lose it.
Love this item! Clears space in my diaper bag for other things and the prints are super cute!
This is the only pacifier my baby will take (thank you green hospital pacifier). I am just grateful that the soothie comes in more colors now. The pink and purple ones are great and very girly. I'm a fan of anything that lets strangers see that my baby is a girl. :)
awesome item
"Very cute.<br />My baby is in love with it, won't go to sleep with out it."
"Great product, thank you!"
These are the only pacifiers my nephew will use and they are perfect.  Highly recommended!
"Great product, thank you!"
Fun surprise!
"My baby loves these bottles, I do too. I love the design, easy to clean. The mam gift sets are always cheaper,this is my 3rd set. I wanted the monkey set but got the otters set,  that's my only complaint."
Love this and so does my baby.  The elephant is super cute and easy for my baby to hold on to.  Highly recommend!
Best pacifier! My 11 month old has not been able to bite through it and he has 6 teeth.
Love it and everyone always comments on it.
safe and my grandson loves it.
This review is really on behalf of my babies because we have tried different ones but both would only use Soothie pacifiers.
it was a gift. snd they liked it a lot
so cute! and easy for mytoddler to hold onto
it's just what i wanted for naps on the couch.  perfect delivery.
wife is very happy and so am i for the price
very pretty
"looks great. it's 15&#34; x 11&#34;. works great. easy to use. it needs distilled/boiled water, but i just do a kettle and fill up a wine bottle and use that a week or two. i wash the items and place it on the rack and when it fills up i turn it on. it has a few options. it has the i need it now 10-15 min., the 45 min. w/dry and the 60 min. like new w/dry. i use it for tons of stuff. from baby toys, to feeding supplies, to straws, jar lids, pump supplies, anything i can put in here that my kid puts in her mouth that is plastic or glass. but in reality it's just a lazy tool. i don't have time to boil stuff on the regular, and i don't use microwaves. it's a rich mans accessory, but it's real nice. if you can justify it, i suggest it."
"baby loves this! it's very soft. luckily, i received a boy color! i recommend this item for gift giving. i plan to order more for new baby gifts."
easy way to avoid processed baby foods and prepare your own after steaming.
cute little toys. my grandson used to watch them after we would wind them.  great entertainment for infants. thank you
very good
works wonderfully
"i got this back of bandana bibs for my then 6 month baby boy basically because he is a drooling machine and i was going thru 3 to 4 bibs a day, but i was not really happy with the quality and look of the regular bibs i was using. the bibs came securely packed and included a coupon to use in a next purchase. once i opened them i loved how vibrant the colors were and also how soft they were. i also liked a lot that they had two snap options so my baby could grow into them. he is 11 month and still uses them. i have to say that the quality of this product is great, i have wash them countless times and the colors and fabric still look the same. highly recommended"
My niece really liked this one.
Great pacifier! My son only used this brand -and not to mention they give personality !
Saw this on shark tank and thought it was a good idea.  Awesome concept!
The best nubby...hands down!!
The only pacis to buy! Love how they fit against the face. This is an advantage to when your baby starts sleeping on their stomach and turning their head from side to side. It does not get easily knocked out like other pacifiers do. Not as bulky as other brands.
Seriously bright glow in the dark so you can find them middle of the night.
So cute!
So cute
"Once our son started jamming the newborn sized MAM shield sideways in his mouth and getting it stuck, we moved up to the 6+ month size. These are great and very easy for him to grasp."
"These work great! My son didnt have any problems switching back and forth from this one, and to the other mam kinds."
Perfect for Baby. I don't have to worry about him swallowing the soothie.
i ordered two and they work great. they are secure in the shower and don't budge. easy to move to a different spot but helpful in keeping a person from falling.
"my baby got into everything until i found these, now they're everywhere- cabinets, drawers, on trash cans- and my life is so much easier."
very nice!! love it
love it! this is what i was expecting! on time!
works great! harness buckle sits forward more which makes it easier for bigger/older children.
"love these- no need for dryer sheets, i put a drop of lavender essential oil on mine if to make my laundry smell fresher and i really feel it cuts down on drying time!"
"i all around love this. haven't used it to warm up baby food just yet. but it's warmed up my breast milk perfectly, and water. i would recommend if you have hard water and develop calcium deposits to put vinegar in the bottom and let it sit. then wipe out. :)"
so very cute!
to be honest i actually prefer these over the medela ones. you really can't beat the price either!
great affordable changing pad- gets the job done
love these diapers- they are great and fit well. patterns are perfect for a boy or girl. i prefer to use charcoal inserts in stead of the microfiber that comes with these.
"we purchased this crib mattress for a vacation house. at home, we prefer to use an organic crib mattress, but they of course are very expensive. this mattress had good reviews and was very reasonably priced. it is soft and comfortable and our daughter sleeps well on it. for everyday use at home i would recommend buying a more natural mattress without harmful chemicals or plastics, but this is a good choice for an extra crib or for someone looking to an inexpensive option."
love it!
"these are the go to pacifiers for us. we had them at the hospital and swear by them. i recommend them to everyone i know who is having a baby. the only issue we have is if you have pets, the material does attract hairs easily. but that isn't something a wipe or washing can't fix!"
I used this in the bottom of hit Pack n Play and all of the sudden my son wi actually sleep in there! This works great!
We love NUK because they seem to be the only style of pacifier that will stay in newborns mouths for more than 5 seconds. I also love that they come in multiple sizes to grow with babies who have a hard time dropping the habit as newborns.
This pair was a hit! I got them as decorations on a dipper cake for the  dad to be Huggies and Chuggies party. The guys thought it was so cool and the new mom to be thinks its just to funny and cute. They came in a plastic flip bag together so it was def a good choice to put on the cake. I would not want to give it in that bag. Just not a good presentation.
Super cute. Fast shipping. great price. A+++
"These pacifiers are great. I used them with my son seven years ago and I'm using them with my daughter now. Here is why I think they're so great:<br />-they leave no marks on my baby's face<br />-they are easy to clean<br />-I strictly breastfeed, and there has been no nipple confusion problems at all with these<br />-they are reasonably priced so it's easy to have them all over the house<br />-the pink and purple colors are fun!"
Loved it!
"My baby loves these.  They fit great and are good quality.  The glow in the dark feature isn't really that important, but it is kind of cool."
My grandaughters favorite binkys.
Bought this when son was 2 months and he didn't know what to do with it. Now at 4 months he adores this. He pops the soothie in and out of his mouth- kind of like a game to him haha. The giraffe is super soft and lays right on his chest.
Perfect game! I ended up having to print out more pacifiers because we had a big shower for my sister but no big deal because everyone loved this game the blindfold was just thin cardboard but it fit the kids and adults perfectly! I would definitely recommend this product!
Avent does not have many graphic choices when it comes to pacifiers. these are cute and do glow
A little pricey but well worth it!
a shower gift that was requested by the mom to be.  it is cute! she liked the gift.
does the job well as expected. very affordable price.
"we recently transitioned our daughter to a toddler bed this is the only rail that really fits safely on her convertible crib (the same model as this rail, purchased from target). you have to have the piece of wood that comes with the crib to use this as it screw in very securely to the bed frame. our daughter now sleeps on the edge of the bed, right near this rail, and it barely gives at all, making us feel that she is safe and unlikely to fall out of bed! it does only cover less than half of the length of the bed, but if the child doesn't roll around too much they should be fine!"
"wife and i are having twins and decided to give this car seat a shot. we received them pretty fast (even though we live in fairbanks, ak). you can see that this is a good product right away. another reason why we chose this carseat is because it is lightweight. my wife is small and this being lightweight helps out a ton with her being able to carry them pretty easy. the click connect is really handy when you put 2 car seats in either the stroller and in the car. i will give a better update when the little ones arrive in a few weeks. but so far so good!"
ive only had these pouches a wk and i love them! i blend up my baby food and freeze it in ice trays. stick some frozen cubes in a pouch when we are on the go and she loves them. also very easy to clean in dishwasher. hope they last a long time!
"i love that it only weights 10-11 pounds. it's much easier to get into my car. the only downside is that if the baby isn't in the stroller, sometimes it will to over ( if you've put things in the handle). empty, it can handle the disorder bag, but not the disorder bag and my purse."
great
i love the minky for the price it is worth it no leaks no rashes ( super diligent on changing diapers often) does the job well without being ultra pricey
used for my newborn...4 mo old now and still using. was 4 days late so these aren't only just for preemie babys. great to use if you're also breastfeeding. ordered 6 to go with the 6 dr browns bottles i ordered on amazon. will probably order more bottles. keeping the size 1 nipple that came with the bottles on standby for the next stage.
love the bed will buy from this buyer
i love it just what i was lookingfor
this really helped us with the huge pile of stuffed animals that were scattered around the playroom. now we have storage and seating.
"bought this so i could use an already-owned backpack as a diaper bag. organizes diapers and wipes for two kids, plus all the little things so they don't just get lost in the bottom, and there's room left on top of the backpack to stash blankets and such. perfect."
love this little plates. good size for my 15 months son's meals.
"Love it, so cute"
Excellent product.  My granddaughter loves these pacifiers.  Now we don't worry so much when they fall to the floor when we are out and about in public places.
"I tried several pacifier brands and my girl loved this one the best. No issues with breastfeeding when we introduced it, which is what some people worry about."
"Great product for babies, particularly those who need a pacifier, but haven't mastered keeping it in their mouthes yet."
"This is by far my sons favorite pacifier.  Even at 1 month he was able to keep a hold of it longer than the average pacifier. However, you can find it cheaper at Babies R Us."
"These feel absolutely amazing and are very soft. Well worth the money and super cute too. It wasn't as sparkleally as expected,but thay doesn't matter too much when they do the trick and calming down my little bratty baby. :) thumbs up. Would buy again. I expect nothing less than perfect from the germans."
Love the sports design. Very durable and strong for children who are teething.
"Bought these for my grandson. Not only do they look amazing, but they are also his favorite pacifiers!"
"If your kid likes MAMs these are great, easy to hold in there mouth by themselves and they look cute too! The glow feature is awesome and they really do glow pretty bright in a dark room. Very helpful if baby drops binky and your searching with tired eyes."
Baby loves her wubba. Very easy for her to find the nipple after taking a break from sucking. The only downside is sanitizing nipple everyday can be quite a pain with having to avoid wetting dog.
Very cute and worth the purchase!
I like this product.  It really does soothe.
We received one of these as a gift and our baby fell in love with it. When we misplaced it I was thrilled that I could order a replacement on Amazon Prime! The pacifier is a pretty universal one that can be found at any baby store. It's actually branded Soothie(TM). The lamb is just a plush stuffed toy that has been attached at the mouth to the pacifier. They are permanently attached and the plush usually gets wet when I'm washing the pacifier. It does dry very fast so this is not an issue for us.
so cute
Baby loved it
Quite possibly the world's most perfect paci!
"matches great, fits security, gives cozy feel and protection without making me nervous as cloth bumpers do."
Nicely packaged and no pacifier missing.
"we started introducing bottle to our baby when she was 8 weeks old. She didn't take Dr. brown. Pedietrician suggested Playtex Drop-In natural latch on, which has a flater and softer nipple. She still didn't like it. I kind of started worrying if we would have to try a million brands to figure out which she will take. I've heard about MAM before, so started with MAM. Lucky us! The first time she latched on, it was not perfect but at least she didn't resist or play with it. The 2nd time she finished 2 oz! Now she is 13 weeks, no problem with bottle feeding any more. Thank you MAM for such a great product!"
Great for what it is I am sure but does not work well for kids with high arched palates.  It's suggested that you size up so they have more surface area and will have more success holding on to the pacifier on their own!
I buy a set of these for every friend that has a new baby. They are adorable and always get a laugh.
"These are the only pacifiers my baby will use.  Over this last year, we have brought over 10 packs.  They are of excellent quality but the baby likes to make them disappear, so we like having plenty of back up."
I love these pacifiers. Their open air design doesn't leave a rash on my daughter's sensitive skin.
"Can't live without these in our house.  My daughter loves the frog.  Arrived exactly as pictured.  Will definitely be ordering ,ore of these in the event that this one gets lost or breaks."
"These are NFL endorsed and are absolutely adorable.  They are the perfect gift for that Packers fan with a new baby.  They are a bit big though, so not for newborns but for older infants."
These are too funny.  Great ice breaker at a bar!
great set!
Daughter loves these! She can hang onto it at 3 mo. Doesn't spit it out as easily.
Love it!!! A favorite in our house!!
"I love these!!!! My aunt gave me a set of normal MAM pacifiers, which we love. The glow in the dark set is fantastic for middle of the night feedings & other emergencies. No more crawling around in the dark patting the floor in search of the missing pacifier! They charge up in about 5 seconds when held up to a light and stay charged for hours. The glow does not seem to bother my son & we love it because it is a mini glow stick for sleep deprived parents."
It's soft and flexible. She used it at the hospital and doesn't like any kind of pacifier but this one. Glad I was able to find it. Not sold in stores
These pacifiers are so cute and my son loves them! They are very durable and easy to clean. My son is also able to hold them easily.  The bright colors make them easy to spot if they happen to fall (or get thrown!) We have used MAM pacifiers for both of our kids and have never been disappointed!
Exactly what I expected
Chicco pacifiers are the only one we used since our son was born 13 months ago. We tried other ones but Chicco has the best quality and is easy to clean (does not collect liquids inside like others). Love this brand!
my dautgher loves it ! its her favorite one! it s nice size for her mouth too!
"Thank you my new,grandson loves them thanks"
Baby and I are very happy with the Mam bottles and pacifiers!!!!
All 3 of my kids each had their own longhorn Wubbanub.  They are great and are easier for your baby to hold and keep from falling on the ground. Perfect for any longhorn fan!
Excellent!! Bink never hits the ground!!
"A great laugh but as a pacifier my son did not like it, great idea and a good price"
"Grand baby loved the one that I got previously and I decided to purchase another one for the pregnant daughter of a dear friend.  These are the best.  Not only are they cute, but baby learns to hold on to something soft and cuddly."
Cute design and baby adapted very easily to head.
supper cute
good
"Love this pacifier, and so does my baby. Next time though, I won't buy the transparent one, in the middle of the night it can be very hard to find. The colorful ones stick out more."
Love that we haven't lost this one yet!
These are our favorite type of paci - just great quality and we like the &#34;Air&#34; design which doesn't smother that sweet delicate face skin.
These bottles are so much better then the Tommie Tippie everyone kept telling me to get. I feel the nipple on these are closer to nature and she seems to spill a lot less with these. Plus they come completely apart so you can clean them really well.
"I have two babies that started on Nuk brand pacifiers, which worked ok but those have have an asymmetrical design so you can accidentally put it in upside down, those also have a ring that they grab onto and end up pulling out of their mouths.  We have tried a couple others but they did not seem to enjoy them much.  I prefer these because they are symmetrical so when you're fumbling around in the dark half asleep you can get them the pacifier without having to determine which side is up. They have a nub to hold onto with is great because it provides a decent handle to hold onto but the babies don't grab onto them and pull them out so easily.  The glow in the dark feature is great too, makes them easy to locate in the crib at night."
"My baby loves it, it's easy to find in the crib, she looks adorable sucking on it"
Easy to find in the middle of the night because they glow in the dark which is a fantastic feature!!! Love this product and will continue to use!
My daughter is two months old and the wubbanub is a life saver. It's easy for her to hold on to and I adore watching her cuddle with it.
"Lost the grandsons, needed the same as hospital. perfect match. Not hard like in stores."
These are cute and my son loves them.  What more could I ask for?
My baby love WubbaNub pacifier. ..
Baby LOVES it! Keeps her busy long enough to get Mommy stuff done :)
"as a parent you know the importance of having lots of binkys, these are great for the price."
"For other people interested in purchasing, I was wondering what &#34;0 plus months&#34; meant in the description.  I just received the pacifiers and the box says &#34;Newborn.&#34;  So just FYI for other people interested in purchasing this item.  I had to give it a star rating so I gave it 5, but we actually have to return them.  Didn't want to rate as a 1 since we didn't try them and will just be returning them since the age is too young for us."
We love them!!
"Just received these today and my son (4 months old) LOVES it!! We originally bought the gumdrops pacifier for him, but he kept spitting them out. As soon as I put this one in his mouth he hasn't spit it out yet! He's been just relaxing and sucking on his new pacifier for probably the past ten minutes (which is a miracle). Great buy!"
Great quality as always but bottom one is not a grey/blue color- very light clear-ish teal.
Great for a good suck!
A huge hit at the baby shower. Baby not born yet but I know it's gonna be awesome.
Great product I have been using it for four months. I hand wash with natural baby soap and hot water. I am ordering two more now.
"Better price than in store (even Walmart).  Breastfed, post tongue/lip-tie revision baby takes these bottles and pacifier well!"
This is one of my twin's favorite pacifiers.  I'm not sure if its the darker colored nipple or something else but we've tried a handful of others and this is always his favorite.
I love that the light up at night which allows me to find them more easily in the dark.
great product
Use this to hold my cloth wipes in my diaper bag and I love it!
So cute!
great product
These are the only pacifiers my daughter will use.  Good quality.
"good monitor, and has a lot of options that is not so easy to use,."
"water stays warm, bottle stays tightly sealed no leaks. 5 star product."
"my little girl loves this elephant!! we got it as a baby shower gift and it became her favorite lovie. it's nice, small, and thin so i never had to worry about her sleeping with it, we actually lost it right after she turned 1 and i had to rush order another one from amazon because she wont sleep without it. it is also made very well we have washed and dried it more times than i can count and never had any problems."
"very good quality and secure baby seat. i found it to be one of the most confortable seats on the market and by far amount beautiful and simple. my only problem with this prodcut was amazon package handling and shippment, i bought it overseas and payed 1/3 of the price only for shipping it. first issue was the color availability, on the site there were plenty of options but only one could be shipped to my country. second issue was the package, i received it on time but totally wet with the box melting down due to exposition to water. gladly, inside the melted packaged the seat was intact besides the bad smelling (due water). i just cleaned everything very well, put it to dry and nice, my babe loves his new seat.<br /><br />i do recommend this seat, i saw one of these keep a baby alive in a very odd car accident before. it is very very safe and strong."
i love the travel container and my baby loves this spoon. i'm a first time mom and it was so overwhelming trying to find a spoon to use with our baby now that we're trying solid foods. this one is soft on her gums and the shape makes it easy for us to angle it up when feeding her without food getting all over the place.  i bought more to have in our rotation. highly recommend
very useful brush for it's intended purpose. i will keep purchasing.
very good does the job
love it love it love it
very good.  i bought it for my 7 months old babies and it keep them inside.  improvement - need to improve on suction so it will stay up and more sturdy
loved this ceiling medallion!!! what a great accent for a nursery!
wife never stayed with breast feeding but very good products by medela
"i actually got this for myself and have been using it for about a week now.  i had nasal surgery and have not been able to blow my nose yet for 2 weeks.  i am able to use a nasal spray for congestion and also saline spray, and gently blow, and got permission to use a baby aspirator, so i came on amazon and found this, figuring this would be a much better choice than the bulb type i used on my kids when they were babies.  i haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />this little gem is great.  it's quick & easy to put together, take apart, rinse, wash, etc.  it is a little tricky to use on yourself, but very doable lol.  if your mucus is thick and you have to suck really hard, it is possible to suck some of what's in the little cup through the tubing, but it is very obvious if this happens, so it doesn't get far.  it's quick and easy to take the tube off, rinse it out & put it back together.  i even dried the tubing out with my hair dryer.<br /><br />the one thing i think could be better is the tip could be a little more rounded, as even though it is a very soft rubber, when your nasal passages are raw and/or sore, the slightest bit of edge is painful and/or uncomfortable.  it hurts a bit for me to let it touch, but this aspirator has been great for me, being unable to blow my nose, and having bad allergies, i just have to be sure not to go in too far.  also be careful which part you're putting in your mouth if you're using it on yourself ;)"
"strong, useful, well built, easy set up, a little talle than the average infant gate, i am completely satisfied."
love this product. i got the baby buller as a gift but u love using this instead for some of her food. i stopped buying jarred baby food a d this makes it easier to make food at home.
easy to install. prevents compressed lines in our leather seats. extra pockets are a bonus.
"well packed, came on time and work great. got more for my money than expected!"
super soft and cuddly!
just right
"love the mat!  so happy about the purchase.  rolls up, very light and travels easily.  we take it to other people's houses and on vacations (haven't taken it on the plane yet).  awesome on vacation because you don't want your baby crawling and playing around on gross hotel room carpet.  perfect size.  cover washes great and easy to get on.  it also is a great neutral color that works well with the dcor of most rooms.  it works great on rugs, tile and wood floors.  i've never seen it slip on tile.<br /><br />note - i saw some reviews saying that the cover was hard to get back on once it had been washed but i completely disagree.  super easy and i'm usually terrible with stuff like that.  i wash it once a week and i've never had a problem.<br /><br />recommendations to manufacturer: (1) sell replacement covers so i can use the mat while the i'm washing the cover, (2) maybe offer a bigger mat option if people want to fill up an entire room.  a more permanent mat solution.<br /><br />the only con is the price.  very expensive for a play mat but worth it.  organic, high quality and made in the usa.  would purchase a dozen more if i could!!"
"these work as expected. we had some already and just ordered more. my son who is into everything isn't able to break them off, so that's a win!"
"i have tried so many sippy cups for my son and the all leaked. i was a little nervous about spending money on yet another sippy cup, but this cup is great! my son is just over one and is really rough. he throws is cup in the ground all the time. this cup not only keeps his drink cold for hours, but it won't leak if it is dropped, or tipped. the only time it leaks is if i shake it upside down with a lot of force. so pleased with this purchase!"
this was a gift for our grand daughter.  she found it to be helpful.
love mam. these come with sterilizable case which is very handy.
"LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />I had no idea what these were for.  I thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers.  I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort.<br /><br />The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.  The pacifier is sewn into the stuffed animal part so there is no worry about fingers or anything getting caught in a loop or something like that.  The fabrics are bright and cute.  I love the little thing!"
"Works like a charm. My daughter loved it up until my wife and I got her to stop using which was a slight challenge. At 18 months, they should definitely be trained to get off pacifiers. I did try other products but none could compare to AVENT pacifiers."
My grandson loves these pacifiers.  We haven't lost one yet.  This one is so stink'in cute.
Great
great sanitary pacifier with cover
best pacifiers ever! never ever gets dirty when dropped.
excellent
My wife keeps wanting more..
Aint Nobody like Nuk!  They seem to have the best pacis around...
Good
I adore these and so does my little guy. So much more attractive than so many of the other options out there! I get a ton of compliments on them when out with my son and feel good knowing I'm giving him the best. We have a couple of soothies too but multiple times I've seen him gag with those where as the more natural shape of these seems to prevent that.
GREAT PRODUCT
These are the only pacifiers that my breast-fed little one will use!  Easy to clean and the little handle on the front is perfect for attaching a binky clip or for his little hands.
"Wubbanubs are the best!  My little one has about 20, and they are both pacifiers and toys.  I don't know what we would do without wubbanubs!"
"I cannot say enough about this product! Even other parents stop me and either rave about how great they think it also is, or they want to know where I got it. My daughter started teething at three months, and while looking for things that would work for her teething I came across this style binky! Our main obstacle with such early teething was her not quite being able to grasp toys well enough to hold up to her mouth. This toy helped so much as it allowed her to hold onto one part of the toy and still be able to use the binky without having to hold onto a small binky itself and try to navigate. It is also easier to be able to hold her with a binky, I can have one free hand because the toy part of it allows the binky to stay in place. It makes a fun toy as well! She loves spying her binky and getting to play with it and feel the softness of the toy."
"These are the pacifiers that my hospital gave us for our daughter. As a new mom I was TOO careless with them. They were lost within two weeks and I quickly learned that my recklessness was going to come at a cost. These are the ONLY soothies that my daughter would use. We tried others and she would just spit them right back out. I made it a point to purchase a pack of these immediately in store and then order these ones as a back up. It's that critical to have spares. Do not mess around.<br />I found that these soothies work great whether your are breast or bottle feeding. We did both and I found that it helped her transition between nipples well. No latch confusion. It also helps to be able to insert your finger into the hole if your baby is teething so they can alternate between sucking on the soothie and clamping down for their gums.<br />Also, these things are SO easy to sterilize. And I've never had an issue with them ripping.<br /><br />If only I could get my second to use them!"
"I love MAM bottles, nipples, and pacifiers. My LO does too!"
My son absolutely loves this pacifier!!
My daughter lost hers while at a restaurant so we had to purchase a new one. She had a hard time going to sleep without her giraffe. Good thing we have prime so we only had to go without for a few days.
so fun!
Looks nice
Great product
Absolutely adore these pacifiers.  My daughter and her husband farm and of course have John Deere equipment.  This is great for either a boy or girl and just cute as ever.
Durable and easy to clean
This pacifier was absolutely adorable one of my favorites as well as my nieces favorite and it made it here in two days
My sons love these pacifiers and I do too!
"Best investment for baby.  I bought a back up just in case we lose it.  Our baby loves holding the lovey while she sucks on the pacifier, or just to have a toy to hold.  It also stays in her mouth better since the lovey rests on her chest.  I also tuck it into the car seat or carrier so that she doesn't lose it and she usually can get it back in her mouth on her own when she wants to (4 months now).  I highly recommend these and they are my go to gift for new parents also."
"good price.....obviously, if you are buying these, you know what you are looking for so a &#34;review&#34; isn't entirely necessary....these are the type that we've always received from the hospital at birth, but for the next step beyond newborn."
"Just like the hospital supplied, our daughter loved them before switching to her thumb."
"My favorite pacifier. It's natural and it looks so cute. It's very light weight, I mention that because I thought it'd be heavy for some reason."
Works great. If dropped it closes and so doesn't get the pacifier dirty. Very cute and a light green color
Perfect
"Amazing binky! Just like the one they gave us at the hospital, it's the only kind our baby will take. I think the vanilla scent is soothing."
Absolutely love these! Attaches securely to our LO's stroller and diaper bag. Easy to open and can store two easily. A good buy.
We have used these for all 3 of our children! We love the giraffe.  Very prompt delivery after a not so good transaction with another seller. Thanks!
"Wubbanubs are so perfect for newborns that have a hard time keeping their paci in their mouth... For about 6 months it is all my daughter would take, now I get them for all my friends and family's new babies and they always love them :) not to mention how darn cute they are!"
These are my daughters favorite. I thought they looked strange at first but got used to them. She loves them! Great quality. They hold up better than any other brand and we've tried every orthodontic pacifier.
I love these and my son prefers them over all other brands. The colors are soft and subtle. Very cute and they stay in the mouth! Perfect size for young babies.
"I love this and at first I thought it would be too big for my newborn, but because of how it's made its actually easy for her to keep it in her mouth because the elephant lays on her chest. Downside is the pacified can't be removed from the elephant since its sewn on. So cleaning it can only be by hand so you would have to be extra careful it doesn't get dirty, since t can't go in he laundry machine. But it's cute. A great size and my newborn has no issues sucking on the pacifier."
great quality
"great toy for baby even before they can roll around and move much. just know there is no cushion on that fabric bit, wouldn't reccomend use on hardwood floor without some sort of extra padding underneath. still an awesome toy none the less."
"what i like most about these thermos containers is that the liquid will stay cold for a long time. i haven tested exactly how long. but i live in southern california and it can get very hot here. i will put water with ice in these and leave the house with the kids around 9 am and the water is still cold when we eat lunch around 1 pm. while i do not use this for milk or juice, i can see that these would work well to carry milk out of the house for later.<br /><br />they are easy to clean and i like they are not made of plastic. i believe the straw parts are silicone ?this is great if your kids tend to chew on the straw like mine do. these are very durable. it is a little hard to take apart sometimes for cleaning, but once you get the hang of it it fine. this is dishwasher safe, although the cap would likely melt if it falls into the heating unit of your dishwasher.<br /><br />the top has three parts: the plastic lid, the straw that goes in your mouth and the long tube to reach for the liquid. my husband tends to forget to add the straw ?and without it you cannot drink! this cup is very durable. it will leak if your child shakes it, holds it upside down and sometimes it may splash a drop when popped open. but because i use this for water it isn't a problem as it has not proved to be at all messy. but i would not recommend for younger toddlers that shake their cups. these [[asin:b00ohkrm5a playtex playtime straw sippy cup, super friends, 9 ounce]] worked really well when my kids were younger."
had a spot for everything. loved it
"this cloth diaper is very soft to the touch ,comfortable and cost efficient. i recommend this pocket diaper to anyone wanting to add another cute design to their cloth diaper stash"
my daughter's favorite toy starting at 3 months. the first toy she loved because it was easy for her to get a hold of.
i swear by these swaddles! i started using them with my first child and was so happy to see they came in a premie size for my second. my kids have to be wrapped tight to make it through the night. i feel safe using these over a flannel blanket or muslin. they are easy to put on and stay put. i love the variety of colors and patterns as well.
these are great! easy to remove or put back on.  my 3 year old loves to take them down to look out the window and put them up when it's sunny.
very good
THESE WERE GREAT!
"My son never used a pacifier as a pacifier, but he used this as a teether. It worked great!"
"My husband thinks it's adorable that he can see how her mouth works and getting the 2 package is the best idea. (Learn now, never buy ONE of a baby thing) we keep one downstairs and one upstairs and in case of emergency we are always aware of where they are since one is pink and the other is purple. No mix up of is this paci 1 or 2. Great purchase, arrived rapidly and thank goodness because mommy was beginning meltdown mode of baby not wanting ANYTHING!"
My son loved this binky when he was a young baby because he was able to pick it up and bring it to his mouth before he mastered the pincher grisp. Now he loves it as an older Baby because it doubles as a comfort toy!
"Item was delivered within a week. My husband was a little hesitant about the purchase as he thought the stuffed animal would weigh on our little one's neck; however, it's VERY lightweight and charming. We purchased the pink elephant."
Easy to open for a mom with her hands full. Which is great compared to others.
Excellent!!
My baby loves this product. It is easy for her hold and it doesn't get lost like her other pacifiers.
Excellent product!!!
Excellent
Great....
"Our 6 month old LOVES this pacifier. It is easy for him to hold and get back in his mouth. It is easy for me to hold onto it when we are out and about, too, so it doesn't fall on the floor. The plush is soft and nice. I wash mine in the washing machine inside a lingerie bag. These make a wonderful gift!!"
Cute
"My baby has loved these since he was a newborn.  He doesnt really use it as a pacifier, more as a teething toy."
I ordered 2 & my 7mo old loves them
My baby loves these. This is the only kind of pacifier he will take.
good
this suit worked it's magic on my 6 month old i highly recommend it every time we put it on him he knows it's bedtime it keeps him comfy cozy and he doest get hot in it and he is a hot baby and it's 109 degrees where we live we keep his room nice and cool with a fan
perfect for infants transitioning off bottles.
"great product. i originally brought the blue whale by muchkin but every time i turned my faucet on it kept falling off. i read the reviews on this product and decided to buy it. you really have to push it on because it is a snug fit. it fits perfect on my faucet because i have my shower switch higher. i love this product, going to get it for my other home."
this was my lifesaver in the hospital when i hadn't yet learned how to swaddle with regular blankets. looks super cute and keeps baby's arms in place :) my only complain was that it was too warm for summer. for colder weather the thickness of the fabric would be an advantage though!
kids loved it!
"you only really need one of these, highly recommend to keep your hands cool when handling these. take the bottle out of the warmer, wipe the excess water off and pop it in the sleeve."
the baby is 16 mos now and still likes the sounds. even my 14 yr old cat likes it. he naps with it.
Even cuter in person! High quality & very huggable. She sits up well on her own on a shelf too.
Love love love this for my little guy. These are the ONLY pacis he likes!! Nothing else works like these!!!!
Great item. Looks exactly like the picture.
"My 4.5 mo son loves the wubbanub! I personally love cats, so that's why I picked out this one. I didn't like the red dog and yellow duck sold at babies r us. I would recommend this to anyone!"
They really glow in the dark. My son loves them.
Very soft and gummy like. My daughter took a few days to like the shape but does well with it now :)
Arrived safely
all good
excellent high quality product
"Great price, thank you!"
This little giraffe is just adorable. I make sure this goes in the car with us. It's much harder for my little guy to loose it during our travels. The giraffe  is soft and snugly. Perfect for little hands to hug.
"I bought these to tell my lions fan husband he was going to be a father!  We had a girl, but she still used them for the games :)"
This is my number one recommendation for new moms.
My son always likes holding my finger when he sleeps but since we got this he holds it....It's his best friend!!
These glow in the dark for many hours! Makes finding them when my son spits them out in the middle of the night very easy. Definitely recommend!!!
Love it!
"Fits two pacifiers easily. Well made product, easy to clean and stylish. This product always keeps your pacifiers readily available and easy to find. A must have for your on the go diaper bag."
These things are great!
This has been the only binky that my daughter likes. We have gotten all 3 stages of it so far and have been very happy with it. They have stood up to many many cleanings without breaking down. It is also large enough that choking is less of a concern. The back also allows my daughter to grab the pacifier and also to easily attach a strap when she is in the stroller so it doesn't get lost.
"Not sure why..... But these are the only Paci's my son loves.  Now that he is 7 months, he can easily hold onto them because of the openings on the side. This is key!  (Read: he doesn't need Mommy 24/7!!)"
Perfect
Adorable!!!
These are the only pacifiers my little one would take! We had tried the soothies and she just couldn't hang on to them-they kept popping out! These are much easier for her to keep in. She can soothe herself to sleep in the middle of the night now! Happy mama.
"Holds a tommee tippee pacie plus clip perfectly. I can even squeeze another pacie if I wanted, although that makes it a little tight. Really easy to clean. I wipe it out or toss it in the wash. Also easy to open with one hand. I was looking at the jujube holder and almost bought it instead of this one, but I made the right choice. My daughter was fussing the other day and I was able to hold her in one arm and grab her pacie with the other. One less catastrophe makes a difference! Did I mention it's adorable?"
The pacifier set was purchased as a gift and the mom to be absolutely loved it.  Exactly as described and the words are very clear.
Adorable!
Just like the ones from the hospital great buy.
Great
We love all our wubbanubs - we throw 4 in my 8 month old's crib every night so he can find them when he needs them. He learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in.
These are the only pacifiers my son will accept. He can keep hold of them with much ease and they are shaped more natural
"We love these. They were life savers during sleep training because my baby learned to put them in his mouth himself before he could easily get a plain pacifier in himself, so once he learned, we started leaving 4 in the crib every night so he can find them throughout the night and get back to sleep without our help. Also good for the car because he can easily find them without help."
work great
The only pacifiers that my son would suck. Love them. They are very light weight unlike other competitors out there
Adorable
Love these. Way cheaper than buying at the store.
perfect product to keep the pacifier clean at all times
My 8 month old loves these! They are good as teethers too!
"Wubbanub pacifiers are the best. They make a parents life so much easier.<br /><br />-they make the pacifier easier to find in the dark or under the crib<br />-once your baby has more motor skills she will be able to put the pacifier back in her mouth easier than just a regular one<br />-the Wubbanub is positionable, so it can be laid on the babies chest(perfect for the car seat too) or propped up when your baby starts sleeping on her side<br />-it's soft and cute, my baby likes to stroke it as she is falling asleep<br />-I throw them in the wash and let them air dry. They've lasted through two kids no problems<br /><br />Each animal can be used differently. The duck is good for laying on the chest. The caterpillar is perfect for the carseat. I like the red dog best, it's really easy to position."
"Of the three wubbas I have purchased (paci eating dog), the elephant is the best.  It's ears are easy for a baby to grasp."
They are great
About the size of a small womens hand. Perfect for first my essential oil first aid kit. You could probably fit two ish handfuls of cheerios in here if that helps too.
We love all our wubbanubs - we throw 4 in my 8 month old's crib every night so he can find them when he needs them. He learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in.
The Only bottles my baby will take.. also i could find these for a better price.. at Winco Foods they cost $8.00 Each.. At Burlington Coat Factory they cost $13.00 A Pair.. And Here $18.00 for 4 plus 2 pacifiers best offer
These are wonderful for allowing both parent and baby to find the paci during the middle of the night - highly recommend.
Great!!
"My son love these specifiers, they seem to sue than him"
Fun gift for my daughter :)
Great for kids soothing I will recommend to new moms specially for babies this is great for the middle of the night so you won't have to be searching for the pacifier in the dark this will hold and stay in
"My daughter loves her bear! We also got her the dragon because who doesn't love GOT! She likes both, I'm sure we'll get more soon. The quality is great, pacifiers are sewn on good and animals are soft."
"These are the only pacifiers my baby will take, even though she's 7 weeks! They calm her down pretty well too."
"This was a gift for the only baby boy in our family, and it is adorable. LOVE IT, and so does his mama."
Purchased this cute little paci for my granddaughter.  Cutest thing ever....besides my granddaughter.  Definitely a must have for those cute babies.  The seller provided a great price and fast shipping.
"This MAM gift set is nice! We don't use the binky, but these bottles are great. There are 2 smaller bottles with size 1 nipples and 2 larger bottle with size 2 nipples. The only issue I have with MAM bottles is when warming he milk, it tends to leak, so we now have to use a different bottle to warm the milk and transfer it to these bottles. The baby likes it so we are happy."
"Baby starting to adjust to it. I like it, it's ok."
This worked great for my son. Always on hand & doesn't fall when he spits it out. & it's completely adorable.
"My babies love their wubbanubs! Sometimes they aren't even interested in the pacifier part, they just like the stuffed animal."
Exactly what I expected.
Very nice
"My grandaughter can't get enough of these pacifiers. She loves carrying them with a foot in her mouth, so her hands are free. They hold up well to daily washing. It's her go to toy when ready for bed."
My son loves these pacifiers since he was a newborn. They are easy to clean.
very good.
"I have six of these things. They're wonderful because they're easy for babies to find in the night if they're dropped, ensuring that they don't wake up as often, and because of their size, I have only ever lost one. They started selling them at Babies 'R Us recently, but they don't seem to be made of the same quality, so I only buy the special edition ones- this one is SO soft. We also have the caterpillar (perfect for newborns tiny hands), two dog and a cats. One of the cat ones is from when they first came out in 2011 and one is a more recent one. The newer one is smaller in size and not nearly as soft."
"Excelent, my baby love it"
A erect combination of pacifier and soft cuddly toy. The lamb's leg is great for holding in the mouth so to free up the hands for crawling. Holds up great for regular washings.
I love this bag can fit three pacifiers in it
My granddaughter absolutely loved this I wish they would have had something like this when I had my kid. I would for sure recommend this product for babies.
"At first, I have no idea what kind of diaper bag to choose. Flexible? Rigid? Small? Or Big? I went through pages and reviews and got more confused. Some of them look fashion but I really worried about whether they are practical for me. After all, it is just a diaper bag.<br />I asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old. She told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin. That is the most important. Soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry. She really have the point.<br />This bag is big and light enough for me. There are some points that I like about it.<br />-It doesn have too complex compartments inside which I like. It is easy for me to put things in and take out.<br />-The fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage. The material is good quality. It doesn have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff.<br />-It has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper. That is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk. You need it immediately most of the time.<br />-It surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag. I use it to hold dirty or wet clothes. Very thoughtful.<br /><br />List of things I bring for a day out in case you need to know:<br />-A double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached.<br />-change of clothes<br />-diaper for two child.<br />-medicine like vitamins.<br />-paper handkerchief<br />-talc<br />-First aid kit<br />-pacifiers<br />-milk and two bottles.<br />-my wallet<br />-book. I love to read in the park."
Gave as a baby shower gift - Daddy was ecstatic; all the Bears fans present were miffed and we'll hear from the baby in the next few weeks!.  You can find just about anything on Amazon.com!  Awesome!!
Shipped fast. Very pleased with purchase.
Way better than the traditional pacy's
These pacifiers are the best!
"My baby loves MAM Air pacifiers and I love that it helps keep the area around his mouth dry, especially now that he drools more."
It's soft and the perfect size for my son to hold. He loves it and it helps him sleep. Great snuggle size too when he's not using the passie:)
"I searched through hundreds of bags online and in the stores, and this is just the bag I have been looking for! It is very nice, has a cute color scheme and is spacious yet lightweight. It comes with all of the essentials inside. I am going to order a second one as a back up!"
My son loved it
My son uses this brand bottles and one of the bottle packs came with a free I had to go buy them this is the fourth type of Passafire I have tried with him  Plus I love them because they come in  such cute designs
"This puppy is so adorable. My little 3-month-old can't consistently and steadily hold his Soothie pacifier with his hand, but he has no problems holding the puppy and helping the pacifier stay in place. Soothie is his favorite pacifier so it's really nice to have this little product."
"My daughter loves her WubbaNub so much so that we have had to buy spares! Super cute, just wish she hadn't gotten attached to one of the most expensive ones! LOL"
"Love these pacifiers.  I only wish I could get my baby to stop taking a pacifier, but the sport theme is nice for a boy."
"Our baby loves this pacifier.  She won't take any other kind.  We've been trying to transition her to the 6-18 month pacifiers, but they seem too big for her mouth so we're sticking with these &#34;baby&#34; ones for now."
"My baby has been using this since she was 2 weeks old and she likes them much better than any other pacifiers we got for our baby shower. In fact, I only got these because she would spit out everything we had. I guess these are closer to the shape of the nipples or something... I haven't tried :) But my daughter (now 2.5 months) likes them."
"My daughter absolutely loves these pacifiers.  We were hard set on switching her to pacifiers vs. her thumb, and these were a huge hit.  I received the product as pictured, and they are super cute. I would definitely buy them again or recommend them!"
nice
love this!
Good~!!
wubbanubs make it so easy to find a paci! Both of my babies loved them!
"Excellent pacifier for baby, she was very entertaining and it has very good quality."
My son is EBF and he loves his MAM binkies! I love that I can find the glow in the dark ones easily at night.
Great alternative
"This little pouch is a life saver! It easily fits 2 pacifiers with space to spare. It's so convenient not having to search through the diaper bag to find a pacifier! I also love the snap that is used to secure this pouch, it's much more secure than using velcro like other similar products use!<br /><br />Con: The loop to snap this pouch is a little small. You can't snap this on the car seat handle but it does fit well on a purse or diaper bag."
can't wait to see these in action lol love them
the best pacifiers!!
it's so cute
"handy for little fingers, and so mommy doesnt loose it"
This is hilarious! My niece loved it at her baby shower.
my son loved this!
"Wubbanub are amazing easy to stay in baby mouth an easy to keep up with !! With my first I had to buy so many binks from her losing them !! Best invention ever an o so cute , we have this one a caterpillar and a monkey"
"VERY GOOD, THANK YOU"
My baby loves these. And the monkey shape works the best with its longer curved forearms.
The only paci my 1 month old babies can (kind of) keep in their mouths for more than 2 seconds... And it's natural... Win!
"This bag is the perfect size. I was a bit concerned when I saw it was drawstring, but I haven't had any problems. I just toss it in my diaper bag and throw anything that gets messy in it until I get back home."
Best sterilizer I have purchased.  I had a cheaper one because I did not want to soend too much.big mistake!! This sterilizer cleans well and dried leaving behind no odors or moisture.  I highly recommend this product.
great buy
Perfect
"Covers are everything, easy to take these on the go."
Awesome for infants. They are easily able to find the paci and put it back in themselves.
"MAM brand is what was preferred by all three of my babies, these pink newborn ones are both adorable and perfectly sized."
Excellent!
My twins love these! They were very early so they took a bit to get good enough hand control to grab their pacifiers. With these they were able to hang on to the animals with their arms. These are in many of their pictures because they love love love them!!
Awesome

The safest pacifiers I could find. Worth trying!!!
I've read that these don't cause nipple confusion for an EBF baby. We waited a month before introducing artificial nipples and this seems to hold true! I also like that they are all one piece and easy to clean.
"Kiddo loves this thing to pieces! Some<br />Comments: the pacifier is not removable so you can't pop one out and pop in a clean one. I kind of wish it was a clamp or something that held in the paci so I could more easily clean it when I'm on the go. We had to contact customer service at wubbanub because the stitching on the giraffe ear is coming undone, they were very helpful and are sending a replacement"
"My son love wubbanub pacifiers. I have three, but he seems to prefer his giraffes. He is nine months old, and he is able to find his pacifier when he loses it in his sleep in his crib pretty quickly."
The kid loves it - 9 months old. NON LATEX - perfect for us since my husband as bad topical latex allergy.
Perfect soother for newborn.  I just wish Avent would package more pacifiers with more than 1 color.  I like having multiple colors so I know how many have gone missing.  Both from this purchase are already lost....  :/
Excellent product. Good seller. Highly recommended.
"The monkey wubbanub is perfect!! Can't wait till my 11/2 month son starts grasping things this for sure will be a hit. Im tired of losing his pacifiers, this was worth the buy!<br />UPDATE: We eventually lost this pacifier in the parking lot of clackamas  OR Costco and I tell you, whoever finds this lil guy will be a happy camper. I am really sad he's gone! My 4 month old has a duck, penguin, and elephant in his wubbanub entourage but the monkey was definitely one of his favorite as the body is longer and has more substance for support when laying him to sleep on his side. These make for great baby shower gifts and hold up really well in the washer, to my surprise."
"Awww Suck-ephant, I miss you.  My son threw this beauty out of his stroller near the Southermost Point in Key West and his momma didn't notice.  Good thing we had Suck-dog, Suck-frog, and Suck-asaurus to fall back on.  These are the best.  The elephant was my favorite."
Loved it! Only paci baby would take and super cute! Love that toy prevents paci from getting lost and touching the ground less likely!
Before my dog chewed the this up :( My daughter LOVED it. She doesn't take this type of pacifier as we started her on a different one at birth but she still loved to play with it. Thank you!
Great
expensivefter i purchased that found one( same one )much cheap
"Excellent product, definitely I recommend this pacifier."
"My dolly could not live without her wubbanub! We have a few designs and this is a favorite of hers. She loves to rub the tail as an additional comfort. OH, and it's super cute too!"
Very Nice
Only pacifiers my baby uses. This are the best. Also they when it was time it was easy to break the habit of use.
Best pacifier for breastfed babies. I purchase MAM bottles and thought i give these a try.
We had a blast seeing our son use this pacifier. He doesn't take a pacifier very long usually but it kept this one long enough to give us a few laughs and great pics!
the whole world is in peace
"Our DD is no longer using pacifiers but this is the one I recommend and will always use for future kiddos.  Interestingly, the nature of this pacifier lended itself to our daughter weaning off the pacifier a little after 12 months.  She had had her last pacifier long enough to colapse the bulb flat and since it didn't seem she was ready to give it up, I decided I better replace it.  Apparently, she didn't like the new and preferred the old deflated pacifier better.  So, after playing around and chewing on it for a week or two, I hid it and she forgot about it."
Super cute- Works great!
"These really stay in my baby's mouth when he stops sucking and prevents the nightime wakeup we were struggling with. He still can spit it out amd does fall out if he dozed in a more upright position. I think he prefers the feel of the soothe over this pacifier, but it's been a great way for all of us to get more sleep."
"These are Super Soothies, 3+ months."
My grandsons like their new pacifiers.  Thanks
Super cute! Works great!
The vanilla scented pacifier are the best!
My infant loves this and it stays in his mouth perfectly!
Great pacifier
Great product.
Freaky fun! Great product!
Awesome product!
Natural. Baby likes the item
This little thing is cute and holds pacifiers well.  My son doesn't use them very often but it is nice to have them nearby and clean when we do need them!
"Is the only type of pacifier that my daughter wants. She refused all the silicone pacifiers and this it was our last chance. Fortunately, it worked!!!"
These come in handy when u want to clean pacifiers and bottle nipples and u are not near a water source.
This fits comfortably in my baby's mouth and it's easy to find in the dark.
"My son loves this.  Much easier for baby to grasp than just a pacifier.  And it can go in the sterilizer, which is great."
"This Wubbanubb is an absolutely adorable frog! My son is 8 weeks old and LOVES it already. I just got the order today by UPS. He has a puppy Wubbanubb and will be getting more soon. These are perfect for babies and the animal attached to it is small enough for little hands to hold onto if they choose.<br /><br />A friend of mine said that these CAN be washed in the machine, and dried on low as needed without ruining any of the pacifier or animal."
"My baby loves these pacifiers. They are safe and everyone always asks where we got them. I had previously used the Gerber kind with the blue, pink, or white plastic piece. Those were the only kind she would use, BUT she only wanted the larger size and apparently they stopped Making those so I went on a hint for a replacement and these worked like a charm!"
Love these binkies. They are more durable then the newborn ones. I Used them with all of my children. It is the only binky they will take. Thank you so much for the fast and speedy service.
The kid loves these WubbaNubs. We love them because they're not easily lost!!
Best thing since sliced bread
"My little one was originally attached to the Gerber pacifiers with the blue, pink, or white plastic piece. But she only liked the larger size. They stopped making those after she became attached so I had to find a replacement.  These did the trick! She loves these and they feel safe."
Great
"My little one loves it and has been using it since 2 1/2 months old. Now at 5 months it is our go to for nap time. Very easy to wash by hand or throw in the laundry, and seems to be holding up so far despite heavy every day use."
"I love how these pacifiers glow in the dark. My baby isn't huge into pacifiers, so it wasn't a huge help, but at least she was able to get it at night in her crib without a light on."
:)
"Easy to find in the dark, cute, and the only pacifier my baby will take."
My babies would only take the binkies we got at the hospital.  These were just like them so they were perfect!
Won't buy any brand but MAM. My son loves them. Love the glow in the dark feature as it makes it easy to find during the middle of the night or during the day if it has fallen under the crib!
Very Cute.  Arrived Promptly!
Very cute!!
My son loves his Wubbanuba's! The zebra is one of his favorites. He has been using them since he was about 6 weeks old and very quickly started grabbing on the animal. He learned how to put it in his mouth pretty early as well because it's so easy to grab onto the toy. He also loves chewing/sucking on the legs just as much as the pacifier itself!
"Excellent quality, highly recommended as the best choice for toddlers.  Tried & tested over 3 children so far, soon to be 4."
Keeps your baby's binky clean!
"We haven't used these yet, but the quality of this pacifier is great! Fingers crossed our little guy loves them!"
Adorable!
"With having animals in the house, hair is everywhere. I purchased this to keep his pacifiers hair free while in his diaper bag."
"I bought this for my son and he loves his wubbanub! We don't go anywhere without it. It makes it much easier for him to hold his pacifier in. Before we got this, he didn't quite know how to hold those soothie pacifiers in his mouth. They would fall on the floor a lot and bounce/roll off under the couch or other pieces of furniture, then we would have to spend a few minutes just to find it this wubbanub is perfect for keeping the paci in one place if he does happen to drop it (which doesn't happen as often anymore). They are easy to clean, I just throw his in the washer and it comes out like new, the I lay it on a flat surface to dry."
This is so adorable.
my 5 month old will only take this kind of binky. i can only find the green ones and pink and purple ones in store so i was super excited when i found this color.
My daughter preferred these pacifiers over the others we gave her. They're also great because she can chew on them while teething.
The only pacifier our little guy would take. Perfect because it would rest on his tummy and help hold it in place.
"These are good pacifiers.  My baby is iffy about taking a paci.  Sometimes she hates them and sometimes she needs one to help calm her down.  Of the several different brands of pacifiers we bought her, this is the one that tends to soothe her the best and she sucks on the longest.  As a parent, I like that I can just pop it in her mouth in either way...because of the shape of the nipple, there is no correct up or down which makes it easier to return to baby in a hurry after she knocks it out before she can start crying.  I also like the colors... the white pacifier is actually clear, the only part that is white is the middle nub."
Everything was excellent!!
Great way to keep your baby's binky clean!
must have with new baby
great storage set for the price i purchased two of them for double the storage and it worked out great !! it just makes my sons room look so much cuter and it holds a lot !!
"this very durable and comfortable. my kid love it. weve been using is for awhile and never have problems, easy to detached if i need to wash the cover."
"the grandkid's love their sandbox, and the seats close to cover the sand when not in use!"
"i love this. every at my disposal, and arms have cushioning."
"i love these formula dispensers.  super useful. i use them to store formula, pacifiers, bottle caps, and other random things that my baby needs while i'm out and about. works well with dry items (never tried with wet foods).  you can take as many compartments as you need.  i love how each compartment can be opened with or without the spout which makes putting formula into the dispenser just as easy as emptying it out (without leaving any formula stuck inside the container)."
Very strong.
Everything was excellent!!
I am very pleased that I got exactly what I ordered...not badly priced and very fast delivery. Definitely be ordering again.
My baby can easily hold on to this pasifier. It doesnt get dropped as much as one that's not attached to a animal.
"These are a must for parents! Our baby takes well to them and this color is easy to spot on the floor when they're dropped, especially in low lighting!"
Love it
My granddaughter started using a WubbaNub at birth and is still using it at 5 months.  All the designs are really cute - I haven't seen one I don't like.
"Love these! I am hoping my #3 will love this soft lil' dog! I used one for my #2, but he didn't use it much. Just the right size for baby."
"These are great and go well with the Munchkin Latch bottle system. It helps avoid nipple confusion. However, my son seems to prefer the Chicco Natural Fit pacifiers, but will use both kinds."
Great gift for a baby shower
Love these!
My daughter loves these. Perfect addition to our little menagerie. Arrived on time.
Love these!
So cute easy for baby to grab & find on his own
This is a great starting set for any new born.  My wife loves MAM and having four bottles and soothers in a single package is a great deal!
I love it!
So cute .. every mom should have one of these cute creatures
Everything was exactly what I'd expected and within time frames.
Great item! fast shipping! Thanks
Very cute design.
My babies favorite wubbanub!!
my daughter loves this brand only and my wife loves the colors so win win
This is the fourth one I have bought. Each one has been great. The best part? It is completely washable. Just throw it in your washing machine and it's as good as new. My son loves his dinosaur. He likes to rub the legs as he falls asleep. It is quite soothing. I just bought this one and the frog for the new baby that arrives soon.
"Awesome for night time, easy to find in the dark."
"This little lamb is just so precious. I was really hoping my daughter would love her Wubbanub as much as I have seen so many other baby have, but sadly, nope :( but that isn't the companies fault. These are just fantastic. If I had to criticize one thing it would be that they are rather hard to sanitize. I had been wiping it down with pacifier wipes but I like to boil and microwave sanitize my pacifiers and you are not able to do that with this. I tried holding just the pacifier in boiling water but the steam got too hot and I was not able to hold it there long enough to count. Then, dummy me, thought it would be a good idea to prop it up on the side of the pot so that the just the pacifier was in the water and ended up getting char marks on the lamb, don't do that! Otherwise, it is great!"
Love these. They are exactly the same as the ones in the hospital. I have bought 4 packs already and only because I'm clumsy and keep losing them lol.
The cutest binkies ever. My son loved them as a newborn but has decided he prefers MAM as an older baby.
"Great price, love it!"
My new born girl just love it much!
My baby loves the bottles and they are easy to clean and fill.  The numbers on the side are readable even when full of milk.
Purchased these for our daughter that is to be born in a few weeks. Our son loved all time tippee products and we are hoping the same for our daughter.
Too big for my three month old.
"We have the dino version of this and my son loves it so we thought we'd get one more of a different style. These are good because it's a pacifier and a plush all in one.  During the night if he wakes up its easy for him to find in the dark and grab onto to put back in his mouth and go right back to sleep. Worth it's weight in gold to a sleep deprived parent!<br />Note: It's Machine washable, air dry."
Just what u expect good product
"I give these to all my friends who have babies.  I don't know if they appreciate the gift, but it makes me laugh and besides, everyone else is going to give them precious blue or pink or gender-neutral binkies, but what could be more gender-neutral than a red and black vampire binky??"
"My son loves it and it matches his NYY outfits, great deal a must buy to all the daddies out there."
The best pacifier in the world  (according to my grandson).  Bonus as toy.  Easier to find!!!
"My baby loves these pacifiers and I already bought two more, they are great and easy to find around the house!"
"We now own 3 WubbaNub's because they are my daughters favorite!  She doesn't even need to be sucking on the pacifier part all the time - she is content to simply be snuggling the little animal part.  She is teething now and she frequently takes out the pacifier and sticks one of the animal legs in her mouth instead.  The dogs are a little confused because they think all small stuffed animals are their toys, but I just throw them in the washing machine whenever the dogs get to them and they wash right up.  I have washed mine a few dozen times now and they are all still holding up perfectly!  I will probably include one of these for every friend's baby shower in the near future."
Love the fact I can have a different color than just the green.
These things are awesome!  My LO loves his WubbaNubs!
Nice quality!
Great
my baby boy loves it so much i might have to buy an extra one in case we loose it
Love these pacifiers. They are the only pacifiers my son will take.
Best pacifiers. And very cute colors!
"My kid is obsessed with those wubbanub pacifiers which is fine except they cost like $13. Because I would like to send my child to college, I am unable to buy the requisite 13 or so she would like to have. These soothies are the same pacifiers used on wubbanubs and are good in a pinch."
Great pacifier for my 3 year old. He is autistic and will not sleep without a pacifier. These are the only ones he hasn't been able to chew through. I do replace them every 2 months and I check them daily for any signs of rips or holes. They are soft but strong and I like that they are made of natural rubber.
"This is a must have for my son. We have also purchased the lamb, monkey and giraffe but this one is my favorite. It seems more solid in size and unlike the giraffe, there are no parts that make it difficult for a baby to use (I.e. the neck of the giraffe makes it hard for a child to keep in their mouth). The color of the bull also hides stains that don't come out in the wash and overall, cute!"
"love it! little pouch that i use to store pacifiers and wipes in the diaper bag. not really big enough to be a true &#34;wet bag&#34; in the cloth diapering sense of the word. however, you could use it for cloth wipes! :-)<br /><br />keeps all paci's safe and easy to access!!!"
"So cute.  And I'm not too sure why but even when placed in the freezer (teething, only for a few minutes) they still glow after being in a drawer before hand."
My son loves this thing! He loves to play with the animal and puts it back in his own mouth. He used to like this a lot more but He prefers his Avnet pacifier to this now. He still likes it now and then. Have two and will buy one for all my future kids.
Adorable
We love the WubbaNub!  We had a few for my daughter and have had a few now for my son.  They make it so you don't have to chase a constantly falling pacifier and the weight from the animal helps to keep it nearby as baby starts to learn to use their hands.  Highly recommend these!
"This toy has saved our car rides with my 6-month old! She would cry and cry, lose her nuk and her toys in her car seat. This offers a great distraction from being away from mom in the back seat. We use the Nuk pacifiers with the handles and they stay in securely. I also used the teether toys which are cute but heavy. I tried to do one teether toy and one nuk but the teether toy made one side too heavy and didn't work well. Either way she likes the teethers on their own. The materials used are soft and the toy itself seems of high quality. The cow design is so cute! My one concern might be that the pulley system have a bit more tension to avoid sliding while my daughter has the pacifier in her mouth. It is hardly a problem but I could see how it might be an issue if you had a younger, less strong baby to pull it down and keep it in her mouth. My pediatrician even thought the toy was a great idea at her last checkup! Baby girl loves this thing I it has really helped cease the screaming in the car. Great little toy and very useful for us!"
I don't know how my first son made it through without these! My second son is now 8 months old and still loves his Wubbanub. It's easier for them when they're little to find and to keep in their mouth as the stuffed animal part will just sit on their chest so if they open their mouth for minute it doesn't just roll away. And with him at daycare this also acts as his &#34;lovey&#34; from home and helps him to self sooth. The only problem at daycare is that all of the other babies want one too. :)
Adorable.
Seem to disappear like socks in the dryer but I always come back for more because baby Charlotte loves these.
Great thermometer! My son has had this one for five years and recommended it to me.  I love ours so much it has become one of the gifts I give to new parents.
These pacifiers are the ONLY pacifiers my daughter likes. But she like to have it upside down (the sucking part is still the same) but on the top where it touches her lip has a tiny inscription and she decided to just put it upside down and she loves them.
Perfect just love it will need to buy more.
These are my baby's favorite
"We use nothing but soothies right now and our daughter loves them. Unfortunately, we keep losing them. LOL"
Love these pacifiers! My baby loves them too. They're lightweight so they don't fall out easily and they have cute designs.
This is the only pacifier my newborn seems to take. (I've tried atleast 4 other types.). I like the bright yellow color because I used them for soothing her during bedtime and am able to easily spot it in her crib once she's asleep.
Love that they are dishwasher safe! My little one loves them.
"We knew with our second child time was going to be short and precious. With our first daughter I remember all the hours spent sanitizing and drying bottles. This time around we decided to invest in this device and are happy we did.<br /><br />There isn't much to say beyond it does what it is supposed to, it saves us an enormous amount of time and that makes it worth the money. Once or twice a day we collect used bottles, rinse them and remove anything major using a bottle brush and then load them up into the Baby Brezza. Usually we do this before going to bed.<br /><br />It works its magic and bottles come out sparkling and dry. It is a decent amount of money for something you can do for free. So the real question is what is your time worth? For our family a lot and any little device like this that can give us our time back is well worth the cost."
Love these pacifiers and my daughter does too. :)
"Purchased as a baby shower gift for a friend. The actual pacifier is clear, leaving you to see that cute little face beneath and it is BPA free. The mustache is removable as necessary, body friendly silicone, and the most adorable thing you ever saw! My friend absolutely loved it, she laughed with unfettered mirth over the idea of it."
So stinking cute (the small mustache is 0-6mo and larger one is 6-12 mo)
ok
I bought this for my grandson. It's very nice. It exceeds my expectations!
"Gift for my cousin. Saw the pacifier on Shark Tank, thought it was very ingenious. Ordered it the same night. My lil cousin is still to young to appreciate it, but we will see as she gets older."
"These are my baby's favorite!  She has liked them since she was a newborn and now that she is almost 5 months old, she likes to stick her finger in the middle and take it in and out of her mouth.  It is also a good teething device!"
"LOVE Wubbanubs- Perfect for keeping passy from rolling all over or under the couch or bed, stays put when falls out of baby's mouth and easy to find if dropped. Also serves as a lovey."
LOVE Wubbanubs- Perfect Shower gift
Know a new parent that is a Sox fan? I do and what better thing to get him. It's different from the typical baby gifts. Quality made and safe for babies. Help your friend indoctrinate the little sports fan early!
"it's cute and perfect for glamping our camper, shabby chic. it is small and still a little sparkly enough for what i need.<br />had to go with a plugin, no switch for hard wire.  the only problem, it only came with one bulb not 3 as stated."
these work just as expected.  they cover outlets tightly but not so tight so you would need a screwdriver to pry them off. good for keeping little fingers out of sockets.
excellent milk bags.. never leaked once!<br /><br />highly recommended
"havent used it yet but its really nice for the price. my note 3 phone fits in the phone slot, and our galaxy tab fits in the tablet slot as well. it has a cute little pacifier pocket as well. my only beef is there arent pockets on the inside, but i may go buy an insert to solve that. the quality is really nice, feels durable. the changing pad is small, dont expect a big one. the wipes compartment snaps pretty well, i guess that will have to wait for use."
so cute and inexpensive
great! easy to clean and kids like the novelty of it.
"it is not very easy to fill with a spoon. i am also a little confused where the max fill line is. my one year old likes it, 3 year old prefers the &#34;real thing&#34; (the store bought pouches). i was very skeptical and feared that there will be leaks or explosions, but so far (2 weeks) so good.  i upgraded by rating from 4 to 5 stars. after my review the company contacted me and give some suggestions about the fill line. such a wonderful customer service! thank you!"
"this suit was a lifesaver for my son... we started using it when he was maybe 4-5 months old to transition him from swaddled in the rock and play to unswaddled in his crib. the first night in it he slept all night (hadn't been prior to that). he was always so calm in his suit and never woke up transitioning from my arms to the crib. he slept late in the mornings (until 7:30 or so) and generally slept all night in it. the weight of it / fabric was perfect (we had the cotton in va) ... never too hot but kept him warm. fast forward to now... he's almost 8 months and i am trying to wean him off of it. it's going terribly to say the least. he became very dependent on the suit for all night sleeping. after a week of no sleep for me, i put him in it last night to try and let us all get some sleep and after being out of it, he was rolling over in it which he had never before attempted. i guess that's the end of our wonderful days in this suit"
"have used for several years.  easily washed, and travels with ease."
"great product, just what i was looking for."
this is amazing! it's really light weight and easy to hold for my four month old! i had to show her how to rub the little rubber bristles on her gums and it was all over from there. we have to fight her to get it back when it's time to eat or go to bed! she uses it as a teether and won't take anything else.
this is great. perfect for everyday.
"excellent carrier. if you're wondering if the extra money is worth it for the organic vs original fabric, yes-it is. it's much softer and less chaff-y when wearing it in warm weather with a tank top or anything sleeveless/shoulderless and you'll feel a lot better about your child gnawing on the strap which is inevitable. this is my third child and i have carried all of them in a variety of different contraptions: original bjorn, sports bjorn, becco -- much prefer this one. we live in nyc and do a lot of walking and this has been the most comfortable on my back and shoulders. it's easy to put on while holding the child which is impossible with the bjorn and fairly easy to move into back holding position without assistance. the pocket is also great for holding your phone and wallet. it poufs out a bit so the items dangle away from your child rather than rubbing against them.<br /><br />i ordered the zen and received the dandelion pattern instead (looks like the sticker barcode on the box was mislabeled) but amazon customer service handled the issue quickly and professionally (am i the only one a little unnerved by the casual tone of some other companies? zappos made an error on an order and sent me an email that literally said, &#34;sorry, man!&#34; not so with amazon and i appreciate that.)"
great idea my daughter was having problem with potty training till we got this watch now she goes every time it goes off.
this is awesome. every patent should have one for there child.
cute; adheres well.
love these bibs! very high quality and gorgeous colors! i hate that most other bibs out there have velcro. these are perfect!
love it!  absolutely perfect for a diaper bag and short trips out.  fits 3 scoops of formula in each section easily.
my wife says:<br />i love this!  my baby sleeps directly on it.  it is soft unlike the old ones that were stiff and uncomfortable.  i will be buying another one.
too cute for words.  bought for my neice and everyone loved it.
excellent
"Same as what he was given in the hospital. Thicker rubber then most pacifiers. So by the time he start teething, he's not going to bite through them."
"My son is not a fan of pacifiers, but if he's in the mood he'll use this or his Wubba Nub Nub that uses a Soothies pacifier.  I did not like this at first, because the tip doesn't have a radial symmetry that I was looking for, only a linear symmetry.  I was not able to tell true shape of the tip based on the pictures. I was hoping that it would be more like Soothies, but with a more bulbous tip so that it would stay in his mouth better.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to bother him.<br /><br />My favorite part about this pacifier though, is that when he drops it, it almost always with the mouth-part up.  Or 'butter-side-up' as it were.  The oval part is heavier, perhaps on purpose, so it almost always turns the pacifier 'in-flight' and lands in the ideal position.  Of course, a tether would be even better so that it couldn't be dropped on the floor at all.  But as I mentioned my son isn't a fan of pacifiers, so we don't have one leashed to him 24/7."
"Glow in the dark make them easy to find  in the middle  of  night. MAM is a great brand, the silicone nipple is just the right size for my small newborn, other  brands like nuk, and Playtex  just simply don't work, and don't feel natural."
"Purchased for an added gift for the male boss as his wife is having baby!  Perfect gift that is cute, useful and funny!"
LOVE Wubbanubs- Perfect Christmas gift
LOVE Wubbanubs- Perfect Easter gift
"These are my baby's favorite!  She has liked them since she was a newborn and now that she is almost 5 months old, she likes to stick her finger in the middle and take it in and out of her mouth.  It is also a good teething device!"
great thanks
Fast Shipping! Quality Product!<br /><br />The newest member of the family is a Ladieeees Mannnnn!
"I waited until our son was about a month old before introducing a pacifier. We tried a bunch of different brands before a lactation consultant recommended these and voila! He took it. Next time I won't hesitate to introduce these as soon as I feel that breastfeeding is off to a good start (that he has a good latch, is gaining weight, etc)."
adorable
great thanks
Great for breastfed babies. Helps them not to develop bad latching techniques compared to orthodontic and flat pacifiers.
Beautiful and perfect. My children use the Mam pacifier since they were born. Now they have 2 and a half years old and still use the pacifier wich are very safe and durable!!!
Perfect for baby boo
My son uses mam pacifiers and I highly recommend getting these glow-in-the-dark pacifiers! I originally purchased one pack and then bought two more. Easy to find in the middle of the night without turning on the light. I place them under his bedroom lamp during the day and they glow bright longer at night and during nap. Great pacifiers!!
My son really did not like to take the pacifier until we purchased this WubbaNub. Anytime you'd put the soothie in his mouth he would spit it out. I think the weight of the giraffe on the end makes it easier for him to keep it in his mouth. He now falls asleep easily with the WubbaNub in his mouth and I am pretty sure we will be ordering another one just in case!
Cute!
"I always keep a pack of these in my diaper bag.  They're great for when my son drops his pacifier or teether, and also for when my daughter's sippy needs a quick wipe-down while we're out and about.  I've actually even wiped down my breast pump with these and put the pump parts in the fridge until the next use when I didn't have access to a bottle brush."
Only kind of binkies my baby will use. 10 months old and won't touch any other ones
Great!
Nuk is the best brand.
Quality is good & very cute!<br />my 4 month old daughter loves it!
"If you have an issue with your baby trying to put it in their mouth and are afraid they will choke, this cannot fit in any way that they might be able to!"
Very cute
"I have tried just about every pacifier on the market. Not to fond of the Nuk and Nuby because of the two piece assembly, I love the one piece pacifiers. These are great because they're one piece and very soft. I won't use any other one now!"
This is the ONLY paci my breastfed baby would take.  It is pricey and not the most attractive pacifier on the market but they are good quality baby loves them.
Was a gift for a new mother. She said she loves it.
Only paci my 3 babies will use. One full term baby and twin preemies. Make sure you get real ones not the first years imitation ones.
"my daughter loved this pacifier/toy combo.  easy to hold, soft and plush, oh so cute!  and i liked that the pacifier was similarly shaped as a nipple, in my mind (not scientifically proven) it helped avoid nipple confusion and did not hinder my daughter's breast feeding ability."
This was a gift but I have seen first hand that babies love these things!  Cant go wrong with anything longhorn themed :)
"We love Wubba's at our house!! My son always had a hard time keeping his pacifier in his mouth which meant I was constantly putting it back in for him. The plushy on the Wubba's help the pacifier not only stay in, but make it easy for him to grab and stick back in his mouth. Especially helpful at night time. Love them!!!"
"This was the brand given in the hospital. I went home with two. It was a bit of a frustration for the first 6 weeks because my baby could not keep this in his mouth for too long without assistance. However, I wanted to stick with it because it's the only pacifier shaped most similarly to a real nipple, and I didn't want to introduce the chance of nipple confusion with a different pacifier.<br /><br />Right at 6 weeks, he was able to handle it much more consistently. At 8 weeks, he could keep it in his mouth all by himself. Now, at 11 weeks, he's quite a pro! I no longer have to reach over and help him keep it in his mouth.<br /><br />One day I gave him a different pacifier brand (received this different one as a gift), and I noticed that he had some difficulty latching to the breast for that whole day. Back to the Soothie, and no problems since then!  I ordered two packs of the 3+ month size from Amazon. I saw them in Rite Aid, but they were a bit more expensive. It would be perfect if it came with a case. I ordered a separate plastic case.<br /><br />Any basic pacifier clip with Velcro attachment can work to clamp it to baby's shirt. The pacifier has two holes so you can put the strap through the hole and keep it at hand."
They may be hard to find when you loose them by my son loves these pacifiers the best! And I like that they are clear so they match any outfit
My daughter is 7 months and still uses these over the older ones. (3-6 months) This is the only pacifier she will take
"Cute... baby not here yet.  So, untested!"
Great and quick transaction. No problems at all.
Great
Babe likes these a lot. Her first time using a Binky she took to these right away! My breasts are so grateful! I like that its BPA Free and has the extra holes for air flow.
Great
"Our lactation consultant recommended these over the Soothies, as they maintain better habits. I'm not 100% sure what she means by that, but the kid loves these and took to them almost immediately. They are all one piece which makes for easy cleaning, and you can see through them and be amused by the sucker fish face the kid makes when using them. Selling these in multi-packs is a great idea."
Good
"Our first GumDrop was given to us by our doula.  We had tried others, but for some reason our son only took to this brand.  Ended up buying four more during the two years he used a soother."
This is so cute. I got it to go along with a baby shower gift this should come in very handy!
These pacifiers are wonderful when you need one in the middle of the night! I was pleasantly surprised by their quick charging ability and also their ability to hold a charge for a long period of time. My son loves his MAM pacifiers and these make locating them in a dark nursery or crib much easier when trying to get a fussy baby back to sleep!
cute!
Good
"The little boy loves it. Having teethed he eats pacifiers as he would candy, if permitted. WubbaNub is offered at a good price and are quality product.. He insists on the gobblegoods having a soft cuddly toy, and this one (and the others I ordered like it) is perfect for him."
These are soooo cute and great deal! Everywhere else we've seen them they're at least 4-5 dollars! We got these as add ons for a little more than $2!
My baby prefers latex over silicone and it's hard to find cute designs. These are great.
Super cute and soft. I only wish my baby took a pacifier
The best pacifier!
"this mirror is great! my husband and i bought two other mirrors but because the headrest in my suv does not move we could not find one that worked, until i found this one. i just had to snake the strap between the top of the seat and the headrest. the other mirrors we bought didnt fit around the headrest and required the headrest to rise in order for it to be secured. the daffadooy mirror itself is huge and clear and angles perfectly, making it much safer to look at  my little guy. i think the only thing i wish it had was a light for at night, like the brica mirror has."
i love it! makes pumping (expressing) so much easier!
easy and light to carry around anywhere. fits in my wallet. love that i can throw them out and my baby is still so clean
i love this print! the diaper seems to be well made. my newborn is still too small to wear it yet though.
"wow! this necklace is beautiful! it seems to be much better quality than the one i got from an expensive local boutique type store.  i ordered the raw honey colored necklace. the packaging is so cute and i love the informative insert too! i love the size of it and right after i put this on baby she smiled, drank a bottle, and took an hour and forty-five minute nap!! this would make an excellent baby shower gift too! thank you so much!"
"perfect fit to sit in the back seat, right behind the console - the velcro has also kept it in place perfectly!"
my 3 year old daughter loves it. she turns it on every night. i would definitely recommend this product.
this is a great product i've used it with my son several times like most people say after about 90 minutes there is some discomfort however i have noticed i find myself holding him while in the carrier (this will alleviate a lot of the pressure on your back )or i will have him do his practice standing on surfaces while we're out together<br /><br />overall for the value this is a great product i would most definitely buy it again great product and a good price
"very adorable item. shipped extremely quick, and the packaging (gift box) for this item is adorable.<br /><br />highly recommend"
my granddaughter loved it for her new arrival. he'll be sitting in it after a couple of months and mom will have no worries about germs going into his mouth or on his hands.
the jar is with bright color.and it's wonderful for my daughter.
this was a popular item at my great niece's baby shower. soft and pink and cuddly...what more is required?
so cute and so soft. easy for my 4 mo old to grap
cute and cuddly. arrived on time and packaged well.
great
".the package didn't include 8 corners what is advertised. excellent quality and cost effectives, though the seller sent the missing pieces promptly"
love it. perfect for camping
"love this! lightweight, foldable, great to use on planes or in public places."
"i have been using this for almost 3 years now and it has worked very well. of course by now it has some signs of wear, but i was very pleased to buy this product."
love these
fast and as described
"after lots of research and wasting so much money on cups looking for a sippy that doesn't spill milk everywhere this one i have to agree is the best in that category!!! i have not able to get my 15 month girls to drink milk from anything but bottles. this has worked pretty good one likes it the other not so much. i will say it just seems very close to a bottle but i just ordered the straw attachment so i am hoping to switch to that soon. i love the color coding for use with twins one gets purple the other pink that would have saved a lot of time keeping soy vs milk separate for my girls.  there is one problem! if you are putting cold milk or water in them they are unbearably cold to hold. the up side of that is the drink is going to stay colder longer. i have ordered the silicone sleeve, i think that will fix the problem rather easily! over all i am very happy with this bottle, i just wish i had tried them sooner instead of the bottles i used.  they are very easy to clean no extra parts to clean. they have many top options nipple, supper, straw, or just a cap. so these could be the only covered containers you ever have to buy from baby to older kids. i suggest looking at their website, it states that other brand nipples can be used and lists the ones that work. also thay are coming out with new colors of silicone sleeves august 2015."
"a must for summer! large and sturdy, easily collapsible."
i work in an nicu and this is our favorite swing. it is given to our fussiest babies. the different options including some pretty fast motions and mimic a person. i feel it is does work like a person as these swings and being held by a person are what works best for the fussiest babies compared to more traditional swings. as an rn (like a mom) i can't carry the babies 24/7 so this swing works wonders. plus you can operate it with your feet if you have your hands full so that is helpful. haha.
"five stars aren't enough for this pillow! i have arthritic problems with my neck and shoulders, painful enough to wake me up at night. after a failed search for a pillow that would be firm enough to provide support yet soft enough to be comfortable, i bought this one, and from the first night, it was perfect. slept through the night and woke up pain-free. a big &#34;thank you&#34; to the dreamtown kids!"
does the job well and the easy storage is actually quite useful. its a great product!
love it! my lo don't like anything under the the head. but she likes this one. still waiting for head to stay in shape.
My granddaughters favorite she will not take anything else other than these binkys. Nothing else soothes her.
It great. We are still working on the pacifiers.
"Can't say enough good things about this little kitty.  My daughter loves it.  When she was itty bitty, the kitty would balance on her belly and help keep the pacifier in her mouth.  As she got bigger, the kitty would allow her to pick up the pacifier easily and put it back in her mouth.  Plus, we don't have trouble finding it when she drops it because the kitty is easy to spot.  It's also easy to wash.  I either toss is in the washer and then air dry it, or I just smother it with dish soap, rinse, and air dry.<br /><br />I buy these little things as gifts for all the baby showers I go to.  You should probably get one.  =)"
My son loves these! They are so cute. When needed to be washed I just hand wash the stuffed animal with light mild soap and put in the dryer on low heat for a few minutes at a time or air dry.
Love it
Super cute & my son loves watching the Monkey.  Great idea!
"My baby loves his wubbanub. He likes Soothies but doesn't have a very strong suck, so they fall out of his mouth a lot. Before he was grasping things, just the friction from having the stuffed animal on this chest would keep the pacifier from falling out of his reach. Now he can grasp at the stuffed animal and hold it in himself, or kind of maneuver it back in if it falls out. It makes a great lovey and soother!"
"great pacifier, our baby loves the &#34;soothies&#34; and having these little animals on the end helps keep the paci in his mouth"
super cute and easier to fill out and keep track of milestones than a traditional baby book. highly recommend!
works great for my 16 month old. i think it would be even better for younger kids.
it was a  gift and she loved it
"great potty seat.  urine does get on the regular toilet seat after using it tho so you have to remember to wipe it off unless you want to sit in pee, lol.  besides that, it's awesome.  fits the toilet well.  fits every toilet well since it's adjustable.  i'd definitely buy it again."
"we have a 50' samsung tv that we just purchased and we feel much better with the anti-tip straps connected to the top of the back and the back edge of the tv stand. you want the straps to go straight down to the back edge of the stand, not at an angle to the right or left. when you are sitting in front of the tv, you don't notice the straps as they are pure black. the straps when tightened have no flexibility, so they create a very secure environment. incidentally, i don't recommend connecting them to the wall for two reasons, 1) if the tv stand gets bumped, it can cause the straps to be pulled, and 2) if you want to gently move the stand to clean or work on the wiring in the back, the straps would need to be disconnected from their wall anchors, leaving you without their intended support. and this system is good to have when there are youngsters and oldsters around."
purchased  based on others recommendation and this is one of the best purchases i have ever invested from baby food accessories perspective. 1 oz portion is great size to have and you can pretty much store any food you like. and it's easy to get the cube out (just need to follow the instruction). highly recommended.
i bought 12 month and now 18 month size for my son. machine washed multiple times; the fabric/ colors held up pretty good.
my daughter has refused all types and sizes of pacifiers... except this one. it saved me when my husband was out of town for a week. she doesn't take it frequently but occasionally is good enough. i think its because she is breastfed and it is most similar to her.
good
"i love the adjustable handlebar in the new flex!!! bob revolution is the best there is in terms of strollers. very satisfied! the duallie fits through all doors in public, but people are quick to comment or help hold doors when they see you heading for an exit! they underestimate the skills of a momma or the precision of bob! worth every cent. good sale on amazon around labor day."
good!
"i bought two of these - the lion and the orangutan, one for each of my kids. they're very cute and fit a lot of clothes and i love that you just unfold the tops and carry them to the laundry room."
"love this potty. it's so easy to use and it's really cute. the size is good too, smaller then some i've seen and smaller then our other one but i like that better. it has a good pee guard for boys too, although for my son it seemed like he would always shoot pee up and over the guard. it's just a part of boy life i think that you have to teach them to hold their junk down while they are peeing lol that took care of that. he's almost 4 so now he uses the regular toilet except he has this upstairs in case he has to pee at night. easy to clean and still looks new actually"
"great cover and really cute. we've been using it for 3 months. the diaper has held up nicely, and i love how it grew with my son. it's so customizable."
this toy is super cool my daughter loved it
"sticks very well, colors are vibrant without being too bright."
great for grandkids
my little one loves his pillow!  it is a perfect size and softness for him!  we even take it with us when we travel- it fits perfectly in his suitcase.  wonderful product!
"i am obsessed with these bibs! they are very high quality and not to mention adorable! i've ordered 3 different sets and about to order more. please keep making these! :) the owner also emailed me making sure that i liked the product, i thought that was a pleasant surprise."
my son had not used a straw before this cup. we started using it when he was 16 months. he quickly figured it out!!  we only use water in it since anything else would seem hard to clean out of the straw.
"very nice material for baby to scoot, crawl, and learn to walk. it is hard enough to allow for crawling but soft enough to protect a baby if they falls."
easy to fold and open in less than a minute. wipe down to clean and great for my now crawling little one so he can play at the park. i compared this brand to others before purchasing and checked out friends who already own it and spoke highly of it. definitely would recommend!
"we have recently purchased the infant optics dxr-5 and i must say that with all the monitors we have purchased, this is by far the best and most reliable monitor. we also think that it is very reasonably priced. all in all, we love it !"
love our amber necklace. seems to really work and besides it's absolutely adorable on my son!! the colors are awesome! he has been wearing it for about 4 months now. i put it around his ankle at night instead of leaving it around his neck.
excellent...
"such a stylish and functional bib! perfect for a teething baby, one lasts all day, which is easier than changing clothes all day. super cute patterns, i will be buying more for a shower gift."
awesome
"the washcloths arrived very quickly, i was so surprised!  they are of great quality (not super thin so shouldn't wear out anytime soon).  the best part is that they are so wonderfully soft.  my son loves them!  they are a great addition."
these diapers work well and i highly recommend them.
best cover ever worth the money. no leaks great for predolds and insterts.
"looks good for a potty, my toddler girl can successfully use it, and it is easy to empty. what more could you ask for from a potty chair? now if only it could actually teach a toddler to use it!"
The best- made in USA - good quality- easy to clean- BPA free
Excellent! Very cute!
"Our 16 month old loves her WubbaNubs we've used them since she came home from the hospital. These are much easier for her to hold onto and not lose than a regular pacifier. The animals make it easier for her to carry them around without dropping. The make it easier for mom and dad to spot them and keep track of them. At night she loves to cuddle them in her crib meaning she's had no need for a separate security blanket or doll or stuff animal.<br /><br />The animals themselves seem to be sewn very well. With constant use for 16 months I think only one has started to shown a stitch starting to break. As the baby's teeth came in she eventually chewed through some of her oldest most used ones. At that point we just took scissors and cut off the pacifier part of those. Then she still has the ole familiar stuffed animal to play with.<br /><br />As a dad, I can stuff the animal in my pocket like a handkerchief and leave the pacifier hanging out so it doesn't get nasty.<br /><br />These limited edition ones are very cute. This is one of those items people stop you in the store to say how adorable they are and wish they had them when they had kids."
Love these pacifiers! They are my baby's favorite!!
I love the pacipod keep it clean and I right away know were to look when I am in need of the pacifier
Love the spaces so my son doesn't get a rash on his face from saliva.
Great Item
"I am such a fan of the Wubbanub pacifiers! The stuffed animal is easy for babies to hold on to (even infants!) plus it's a lot harder to lose a pacifier when it's attached to a stuffed animal.  I get compliments on our Wubbanubs all the time.  If the stuffed animal part gets really dirty, I will toss it in the washer with a load of baby clothes.  I let it air dry, then I wash the pacifier part with dish soap and water.  Very easy!!"
I don't leave home without this. This is &#34;dad's secret weapon&#34; when baby gets fussy and I keep it holstered in my back pocket. We liked it so much because the stuffed animal allows you to place it in a position that stays in baby's mouf.
My baby will love this
Super adorable!! My sweet princess loves it!
Best product I've bought! Now have two !
Adorable
"I'm a great-grandma that likes to think ahead. Besides, I am handicapped and live six hours away from her, and don't travel very far. She is only five weeks old, but was almost 9 lbs., 21&#34; long, when born. These pacifiers are for 6 to 12 month old, but I figure she was half grown when born, so may be using them at 3 months. Since they love anything Dr. Brown's, and I have bought them a lot of it, I know they will love these."
"After I got this bottles I never used any other bottles for already 3 month. So easy to clean and my little one loves it too. I'm not sure if this is because of this bottles, but my baby doesn't have any colic from the day I start to use it."
"These are life-savers for us.  My Toddler has been using them since he was 6 weeks old, and has slept through the night ever since he got his first one.  Even as an infant, he could put it back in his mouth when it fell out because of the little stuffed animal on the end.  He now uses them as toys more than pacifiers and absolutely loves them."
"I know so many of my friends and family like Dr. Brown's anything, so since I was ordering some things for my great-granddaughter, and a friends soon to be born grandson, I bought this to put in my box of goodies for when I am invited to a shower, etc."
It is very nice.. The only thing I wish the site would have given me the option to personalize them.
My son absolutely LOVES these pacifiers! They smell really nice and seem to calm him down if he is crying.
Wubanub is amazing! I bought one more for my kid and three for shower gifts. He can now hold onto it and teeth on the feet
excellent
"These are my baby's favorite. They're not too long so he doesn't gag on them like some others I've tried. My first baby would take pretty much any pacifier, but my second is much pickier and will only take this kind. Definitely the easiest to wash out of all of them.<br /><br />Only negative: the nub does make it easy for him to knock out of his own mouth with his flailing hands and arms."
Great value for the money much more expensive in local stores and you only get 2 bottles
I bought this for my future niece after the Doctor I work with gave one to his baby.  Love it!
I can't rave about this product enough. It is perfectly designed to stay in Baby's mouth and easy for him to grab and put into his mouth himself. Also easy for Mom or Dad to find in the crib the middle of the night without turning the lights on. From now on I will buy one to attach to the package of every baby shower gift that I give.
This is the only paci my breastfed daughter wants. We LOVE it. Well worth the money. It fits very snug to her face like my breast does while nursing. It also seems to stay in her mouth with less work than any silicone pacifier ever did. Great product. We will definitely buy another when this wears out.
"We had received another set of bottles for our newborn son; however, the hospital provided an MAM bottle in our take home bag. We tried it and liked it so well, we purchased this set. We liked the pacifiers so much, we purchased some more. Our son almost never spits up using these bottles. They are well designed and so easy to clean. We will definitely continue using MAM products."
My newborn grand baby loved these from the start. We tried others but she knew the difference.
"What a great idea to attach a toy to a pacifier. I was up multiple times at night to fetch for my daughters pacifier, this saved the problem."
Great
very nice
This is still working. Place in freezer & give to my great grandson as needed. He's still teething.
Our baby loves these. Very handy and cute. I wish they were made with the orthodontic pacifiers because we need to transiton to those.
This was my son's favorite character until he met the tiger.
"Got this as a gift for our niece, she loves it!!! Great for babies to find at night in there crib!"
They are awesome because I have tried several and this is the one that has the most  space around nose to help baby breath~  thanks!!
just like the hospital ;)
Good
love them
My 7 month old uses this as a teether. He is exclusively breastfed and does not use it to suck but he loves it to chew on.
Good
The only pacifier my LO will take! Love these
Love these for my 2 month old...they stay in his little mouth!! Life saver
"My 13 month old son loves the soft silicone pacifiers but the narrow ones were starting to buck out his 2 front teeth, these ones are wider and his teeth aligned better after we started using them."
The only paci that my 3 week old son will actually suck on. It has to be the vanilla since we bought some at another store (same ones with no vanilla scent). These are the ones the hospital here gives out to new mommies/newborns. I wanted a couple extra. I just wish they would scent the ones for older babies just in case we may need them.
Love em
"I buy these all the time as gifts. They are such cute little things, and are always high quality. This one was no exception! It also came with a product tag that had safety and cleaning information, which is nice for new parents. I plan on buying many more in the future."
Best pacifier ever!!
My baby's favorite paci/toy in one. The horns are great for little baby hands to hold on to. Great for our little Texas baby :)
"Only thing that my picky baby would take.  She's 100% breast milk fed, but will take it from a bottle.  However she wouldn't touch a paci until we find this.  She had a tongue tie revised and a significant upper lip tie - maybe related, maybe not."
"A diaper bag essential for the mom on the go.  Great for teethers, toys and pacifiers."
These are so cute! Highly recommend for the babe. Helps keep it from falling to the floor.
"The baby loves these! We weren't too sure about the glow-in-the-dark gimmick, but it's been really helpful at night. When the baby drops it and starts to fuss, their easy to find in a dark room without having to turn on the lights and wake all of us up."
works perfect with the stroller!
amazing camera. great battery life if you let it drain all the way before charging it again. zoom feature fantastic for first time parents (is he breathing??). the push to talk button is easy to accidentally push but it doesn't seem to matter. it's so worth the peace of mind.
super handy umbrella stroller.  folds compactly and is comfortable for toddlers to ride it.
worked well and my friend installed it easily.
"mam is the only brand of pacifier that our eight month old will accept. we've tried nuk, avent, and several other brands. this is the only thing that will help him calm down when he's in distress, or simply ready for a nap."
works pretty well. many waiters and waitresses comment how thankful they are that we attempt to keep our little ones mess to a minimum. we also get a lot of people commenting how interesting it looks.<br />i normally just shake the food off while at a restaurant and then wash it off at home and let it air dry. i think it's a great product.
very nice
"soft, adorable, my daughter loves it."
its a good size bag. my baby is too young for the carrier so i have not try out that feature yet.  the yellow is more highlighter yellow than the orange yellow in the picture. also even though the item says bliss the item shipped is the delux. if you don't mind yellow its a great deal
"just got my son's necklace today! he recently turned one and after suffering through teething and with 4 more teeth coming in at once,i thought it was time he got his first teething necklace :) so far he hasn't tried to pull it off or break it,he actually pushes me away when i try to take it off lol! i'm going to give it a few days and see if it helps with his teeth."
amazing...i bought this 8+ years ago.  went thru two grand d. loved it all.  wore great.  ordered additional items from theme also.
"this is cute, double sided and works well. it's not super heavyweight so if there's a big gust of wind it might blow up, but i like that it's light enough for me to know my baby can breathe well under it. it also washes great! i like that if i have a boy later on i could swap the sides and the red/white pattern is more gender nuetral."
"if you are expecting a baby, know someone who is or have a new grandchild due and want something at your house for those short visits, buy one of these!! this is so soft and comfy for baby. a friends baby had colic and she said it seemed to help. it is a very gentle rocking motion and also vibrates if you want. when my daughter finally got to bring her micro preemie home (she had to stay with me for a couple of months for medical reasons) i brought one of these home so we would have a place in the living room for the baby, but not down where the dogs could get in his face (like in a bouncy seat). she wasn't sure about it until it was put together and she placed her precious child in it. all smiles from everyone. it was then in the dining room, doorway to the kitchen, in the hall outside the bathroom while she did her hair.....get the picture? lol much more portable than a pack n play or bassinet. so, give it a try!"
"we love the infant optics dxr-5 for the price. for $100 it works great and the picture quality is pretty good. we like how quickly and easily it transitions to night vision when needed. the set up is easy and the device is intuitive. we're planning on taking it on all of our trips this year!<br /><br />the one thing that could be improved is the range of the monitor/camera. the signal drops out every once in a while, but not consistently.<br /><br />overall, great product for the price and we recommend it."
"we love these bibs! so easy to clean and ready for use again! not bulky though sometimes awkward with small babies. perfect for about 8-9 mos and up. perfect for restaurants because you can put them back in your bag clean. no more washing bibs in the laundry or waiting for bibs to cycle back through, or having a huge stack, just wipe and put back on the hi chair for next time. definitely recommend."
great toy for curious little hands!!
"great product, works perfect for the bed for out toddler.  queen size bed."
my grandchild loves it :)
love it. very soft and breathable.
good
this gate works perfectly for the top of our stairs. i followed the directions that came with the gate and it took about 30 minutes to put it up. it is very sturdy even when my little one (about 30 inches tall) tries to climb up it (which he can't) and tries to shake open the gate.
good for what i needed!
i love this carseat. it's easy to install and seems very safe. we used to have the diono radian and fit barely fit in the back of our small suv. this seat fits better because it has a lot of recline room and it's very easy to figure out how to use the it. the first radian we had was heavy and har for me to install. i read the instructions twice and still had trouble remembering things and working with it. then we got the advocate as a second seat because we use different cars a lot. i loved this seat so much i sold the first seat and got another advocate. the radian was not a bad car seat. it just didn't work for my family. the advocate is a lot wider and takes up a lot more room but i love it.
my granddaughter loves it so that means i love it.
this is the second one i have bought and they both have had a lot of good use and would buy another for a gift anytime
[[videoid:e718ad4e25e6a2a86536d7bffbfbf6ab]] bought this as a gift for my friend who is 23 weeks pregnant. this video shows her using it and her feedback.
really cute fits well !!!!!
everything i thought it would be! it will be a perfect addition for a future daughter.
"very secure, and not too unattractive. i thought we could skip over having one of these things or find something less obtrusive, but knowing what i now know, i wouldn't. just get this one and be done with it."
its really nice
i love the pouches!!!  several reasons 1.  they have a lid not an annoying zip close. 2.  they lay flat to freeze or refrigerate. 3.  they can be used for milk or food. 4.  nothing to wash or sanitize<br />i would also recommend the bottle/food warmer
i love these. got one for my now 3 year old and she used it for forever. it helped keep the pack in her mouth and later she just loved it for the animal. bought this one thinking my newest addition would enjoy it too but she's just not a pack baby.
"so cute and pretty. the light pink beads on the top wings don't show up as much in real life as it does in the photo, but i still love it for my little girl's room."
my granddaughter even she is 9 yr old still love dinosairs and its really hard to find dcor for this age group and specialy for girls .this product really brought nice &#34;dino&#34; touch. lol she is happy and so do i.
"i absolutely love it. i like how its the perfect length. my daughter was less irritable after having it on for a period of time and drooled way less. i would definitely recommend to other moms, especially to those who are curios about the amber necklaces (:"
beautiful and so soft!
safe!
love
chair arrived and was assembled easily.  child loves it!
excellent and beautiful.
all good
this shield fits perfect on my chicco keyfit 30. does a nice job of shielding the baby from sun and insects. haven't figured out how to fold it back up though.
it's perfect for my son.  he is 2 years old and love his potty.
"the tommee tippee bottles seem to be working really well for my baby. since it is really close to when i feed him, there isn't a huge shock factor for him. the shape of the bottle also helps with holding on, in the day or night. looks good and works well!"
great car seat especially when it is hot.  only complaint is small straps - need more length.
great quality. very big. my 2 year old son loves it.
cutest thermos ever. keeps my fruit salad cool and my soup warm for hours and looks adorable. makes working thru lunch fun... almost.
"love this crib! my daughters share a room so we did not have the space for a full size crib. i was a little hesitant to purchase this based on some of the poor reviews i read, but since it was the only one really in our price range, i gave it a shot. boy, i was not disappointed! it's the perfect size, cute, and has held up very well. i purchased the dream on me 3&#34; mattress to go with it since the mattress that is included is so ridiculous :)"
"nice, breathable material. i like the &#34;lip&#34; part of the cover which allows me to see my baby and provides ventilation."
5month old baby likes this very much.
"i have a little one just starting to teeth, and he likes to grab things, but i also work full time in a professional setting and feel comfortable wearing this for work and weekend play time! really well made! and very pretty."
love it!
good
perfect as described and super quick delivery
"i love these pillow cases. they are pretty, soft and sturdy. just what i wanted!!"
"worth every dollar!! my baby boy loves it,and i have more time to do things while he plays in it(i think we all moms can agree that we sometimes don't even have time to eat,soo it is so important that baby can play  by himself).  i also put lot of his toys on the table so its more interesting for him.we bought it when he was 5 months old and now his 8 months,you can adjust the seat when baby grows."
these are great and come with lids for all 3 bowl sizes. similar bowls by munchkin used to come with all 3 lids but now only come with 1 lid for the smallest bowl!!
"We started with Medela bottles, then Tommy Tippee and finally got a free MAM from our OB. The nipple shape is very easy for my son to latch on to, and they seem to help a bit with gas."
My child loved this pacifier.  It gave him something to fiddle with while trying to go to sleep.
So cute and worth the money - my daughter hates regular pacifiers and these are the only ones she likes plus she can hold onto the little lamb
"I love these pacifiers - my daughter hays regular pacifiers and these are the only ones she will use - we have 3 now and I just adore the giraffe- is so cute when she is holding it -,would recommend"
I love this! Perfect for my month old. She can hold it easily and its so cute!
"best pacifiers ever, and they glow in the dark which rules because my kids have always been able to find them in the crib, never had that problem of baby looking for paci and not finding it in the dark, never ever. so grateful, one less reason to wake up in the middle of the night!"
"Best pacifiers out there, my kids loved these, bought tons and tone"
"My picky baby loves these! Prefect for a breastfed baby. Plus, I had these same pacifiers as a baby, it's nostalgic to see my own little one with them. They smell sweet (but not fake sweet) and can hold up to being chewed on."
as good as I expected! our 13mons daughter still needs her wubbanub to fall asleep n we bought it to replace the old ones. this duckie is very cute ; better than her first two wubbanubs which r a pink elephant n a giraffe
"We have 3 WubbaNubs, and I foresee many more in the future.  Our son loves holding onto the animals (we have the monkey, giraffe, and elephant.)"
Hilarious !!
Purchased two of these...one for my son who had a preemie and one for my friend as a baby gift.  I had a womb sound bear years ago for my own son who was had colic and found it to work for me.  Hope it works for them too.
"Great paci holder, keeps pacis and teethers (small ones) clean when out and about ;)"
My son loves them and refuses to go back to his old pacifiers.
Love these!  It makes them so easy to find in the middle of the night.  Thank you MAM for making such amazing products.
"My baby loves these pacis. He had trouble keeping the Soothie pacis in his mouth when he was a newborn so we tried these. They were an instant improvement. He is able to keep them in his mouth much more easily and they have good ventilation holes so he hasn't developed any rash. They also come with a little plastic cover which is great for<br />Keeping the pacis clean!...I should also note that this is my first child that has preferred a paci to the thumb, so at first I was nervous that the paci would mess with breastfeeding. After a lot of research we tried the Avent free flow and we haven't had any issues with breastfeeding so far (baby is currently 4 months old). I highly recommend them!"
Great baby loves
My baby love them.
Keeps the baby happy!
love it
The regular Nuk pacifiers gagged my newborn daughter but these 0-2 month pacifiers suited my baby just fine.
Both are little ones love these.
Both are little ones love these.
"These pacifiers really do glow in the dark! I have them sitting out in the kitchen where the lights are on and off throughout the day, so it's not like they are getting direct light all the time to charge. The glow is strong enough so you can find them in the crib, but slight enough that it doesn't bother baby who is trying to fall asleep.  So around 3 am after 8 hours of sitting in a dark crib, I can still find these things and pop it in baby's mouth, and then baby just drifts off to sleep.  HA! Not really, but these paci's do help. Baby has been using these since he was 2 months old and is now 6 months."
"These are really cute and they stand out a bit from the same old, every day pacifier.  Perfect for sports fans, and they also match lots of little outfits, these are definitely a win at our house!"
Love these!
love it
Awesome! Little man loves it!!
They really do glow! It's easy to find when he fusses at night. :)
Good product. But my son doesn't think so.
"These are the only pacifiers my 7-week old likes.  I kept trying to give her the green Avent ones the hospital sent us home with and the think the nipple part is just too big for her tiny mouth to enjoy!  This one is very thin and fits perfectly between her tongue and the top of her mouth, it seems.  When she's fussy from exhaustion we try to give her this and if that's the actual cause of her fussiness, she takes it and is often instantly asleep."
"these are the only pacifiers my daughter likes at the moment.  I like the different colors they sell too.  Im not into pink much, so my daughter doesnt wear a lot of pink, mostly neutrals or purple.  She gets called a boy often but with these pacifiers now she doesnt.  haha.  my only problem with these is that because they dont have an open handle like most pacifiers do, you have to be careful what paicfier clip to buy, because some are thick and meant to be used on the hard plastic pacis.  but luckily they make paci holders that have a small string to just draw thru."
"Authentic merchandise, original packaging and quick shipping.  Great buy.."
perfect
The best thing ever love it !!!!
My son loves the mams pacifiers.  These are the one kind that he keeps in his mouth. Love the glow in the dark feature. Helps us locate it during the night. Will and have bought over and over again
Great product! My 3 month old liked this style better than a few of the other styles out there. I will be ordering more!
This is great it hangs right in the strap of baby's diaper bag and fits two pacifiers sono always have one handy. It's also cute I was able to match the color to the diaper bag colors. I love that I don't have to dig for pacifiers or clean them when I find them at the bottom of the bag.
"Glow in the dark! What a great concept...who ever thought of this is a genius! Makes finding the lost paci easy for my little one so I don't have to get up and do it for him. Love, Love, Love!"
Works well and is as cute as could be...lol
Wubbanubs are a lifesaver. They are one of the best baby products out there.
"Life saver!!!! This was our 2nd one, as the first one was lost. I had to order one QUICK! It got to me in a decent amount of time. Happy to say its still with us & survived the dog thinking it was a toy for her. I will definitely recommend this to friends & consider it as a gift at baby showers.<br /><br />For any first time parent reading. One reason why these are great, is because it helps the pacifer stay PUT! Huge lifesaver when you just want some sleep, but that darn pacifer keeps popping out. Much easier to find at night too! ;)"
Our absolute favorite pacifiers!
This is the only pacifier that my daughter would use.. She started teething at 2 months and she was just in hell. I felt so helpless and tried at least a dozen pacifiers until she liked the Wubbanub. It's perfect; the plush toy gives her something to play with.  The natural nipple was a plus easy for her to latch on to. My little one takes it out of her mouth to curls up with it in her crib and go to sleep. Instead of the others that she threw on the ground with a look of disdain on her face.
"the cutest thing.  call my youngest grandchild monkey so this was perfect.  it was her security item.  now that she has been weaned from the pacifier, we cut the pacifier off and she still lugs the monkey part around with her"
Love these for the little guy. Have about 1 dozen around the house and have been buying them for our parents houses now.
these are light-weight and great as our place gets steaming hot the closer it gets  to summer. we were also looking for something to swaddle our 6 month old in that was easier to break out of when he wants to than the strong velcro type so we can transition out of the swaddle entirely. would have loved the 4th blanket to not just be plain white though.
"absolutely love this stroller so far! it maneuvers so easily, the simpelest assembly, my 3 year old has room to grow, and it is so light! folding it down is very easy as well once you figure it out the first time. i am so happy i didn't spend the extra money on a bigger brand name. i did not buy this for running or jogging so i cannot attest to that, but for errands and outings, perfect!"
very good
great for the price !!!
best changing pad! great price!
"these cups are great for the toddler who wants to use a straw cup on his own, but also likes to throw it around! the lid attaches tightly, no leaks. we reuse these, bought them over a month ago and still using the same set."
love how large this is for bigger noses.  this is perfect for my 3 year old when he gets stuffy and needs some help getting his sinuses cleared.  gentle and effective.  it has great suction too.  easily cleaned and assembled/disassembled.  i would buy this again.  the 1 oz size is for babies.
"this net is large enough to hold a lot of stuffed animals, very easy to install, great product!"
best highchair. i searched for weeks and finally landed on this graco chair. it is comfortable for my son and easy to clean.
"very useful, good product!"
"great seat!  it is a seat that will work from birth on up (and up and up!).  some of the features make it quite convenient (such as the rear-facing recline position that makes it work for infants and the adjustable head piece that eliminates the need to remove the cover and re-thread the seatbelt as the child grows - as well as making it last much longer by keeping it safe and comfortable for tall children).  this is good value for money.  the sapphire color is bright and works well for girls or boys.  the seat isn't overly cushy, but it seems safe, comfortable, and of sturdy material."
she likes it very much
great product as expected
best deal out there.
so fun to give to baby for tummy time!
this is beautiful and different than most! just adorable!
Thanks
My babies have all loved these!
Best baby product ever. The weight of the animal keeps the pacifier closer to my baby's mouth during sleep. She loves clutching the animal and holding it herself good item to help with basic motor skills.
Ordered for a friend who just had a new baby. My daughter LOVED hers when she was first born. Plus it helps keeps the pacifier in and/or close by.
I'm happy.
I bought this as a gift and I couldn't be happier. It is very well made and too cute!! My daughter was tickled to get this for her new foster baby and the baby loves it. It also came very fast!! I will definitely buy more of this product!!
So adorable and exactly as described.
Bought for my sister an she absolutely adores it! Says all of it will fit her needs perfectly! Excellent present.. An if I lived closer to her I am sure I would love it as well!
"Our favorite wubbanub animal. This one is great for our baby who sleeps with her head turned to the side. We can prop the tiger up so that the paci doesn't slip out as easily. It lays flat on her chest well, too. It also has a nice weight to it."
nice
"We purchased this for two reasons. One being that it makes trying to find the pacifier in the dark or in the car way easier, and two so that our daughter would be able to find it and hold on to it. Product is well made, and well packaged. Item is machine washable (we found this out after it took a swim in the porcelain throne) and very durable. Highly recommended for anyone with little ones who are still using a pacifier."
Baby loves this! Easy to clean and carry... we have 2
Recommended by the hospital! High quality pacifiers! Even the pediatrician recommended this brand! Buy with confidence! I highly recommend this product!
Good!
"Soothies are the only kind of pacifier that my daughter will take. Wubbanubs are not only cute, but the animal provided actually gave her something to hold onto when she got big enough, and when i would lay it on her chest she could sleep without the pacifier falling out and rolling away. Love these!"
Great product!
"My son was very particular about what type of pacifiers he would use.  If it wasn't a mustache, he wasn't interested in using it.  I ended up buying at least 6 different Mustachifiers because he loved them so much.  The expressions on peoples faces when they saw him were priceless.  There were many times people would look at him and burst out laughing.  It was great!  Very cute!"
Very good baby girl. Very soft.
cute
ok
Great quality and too cute.
Baby holds onto animal as using the pacifier.  Great size nipple.
Great seller and product
The pricing is so awesome. This pacifier sells for more than twice as much in stores!
Good quality. Cute and soft.
These are the best bottles I have ever used.
"Our Wubbanub is so popular with my daughter that we are actually now starting to limit how often we let her use it (to naptime!).  She was never much of a pacifier user until we introduced the Wubbanub.  This is great for helping her nap, great for long car rides, and if we didn't limit her, she would have it in her mouth all day long.  The stuffed cow part is durable and easy to clean.  Overall, a great pacifier option!"
Best pacifier we have ever used for our kids. Excellent ventilation around the mouth.
"Our hospital gave us the Philips Avent Pacifier, which is the only pacifier our child will take.<br /><br />However, she had an issue with keeping it in her mouth, so we bought the WubbaNub. This attaches to the binky and acts as a counter weight when your baby decides to take a break from sucking. The benefit is that it doesn't fall out of your childs mouth, and doesn't require constant repositioning.<br /><br />The other bonus is that it gives the momma a break from breastfeeding. Coming from a new father and mother, this is a product definitely worth the investment."
It's nice
Baby loves these. I love that they are pure silicone and they have as ring for attaching a pacifier clip.
Excellent
These are the best! Stays in their mouth! and easier to find!
"These are precious, well made and my granddaughter loved it!"
"Glow in the Dark pacifiers are a lifeline to parents who need sleep.  We don't just put one or two in the crib, we put four, five or six.  When our precious child wakes in the night and gives a cry, we can see on the child monitor that our baby reaches out to find a pacifier, and once in the mouth, our baby goes back to sleep.  WONDERFUL!!  Before, we were sleep deprived when awakened during the night over and over and over.  Now... having to get up in the night is an unusual night, versus an every night trip.  THANKS"
fair price for excellent rattle/toy.  baby loves it.
works great to keep my daughter's car seat clean when we travel. has a convenient handle and easily folds into a small pouch when not in use
"very nice canopy and fits my chicco keyfit 30 infant car seat well. love that the baby can see through the net, and you can check on the baby, while being protected from sunlight, wind and bugs. exactly what i was looking for... plus its very pretty in pink color!"
works perfect. wish it was a little longer though
i used this bassinet for both my children & they slept peacefully! not to expensive & very easy to put together.
this was so easy to install! the tension rods just snug up to the door frame or wall and stay firmly in place even when we bump in to it. keeps my dogs out of the kitchen wonderfully. i am ordering another for my bedroom door as well (until my new little one stops the need to pee on my bed).
good gift for mothers day :)
"this is a great mirror. i purchased it for my husband's car (nissan xterra) which doesn't have a middle headrest. it was easy to install on the side headrest (1 min) and angled in 30 seconds for a perfect view of baby from the driver's side. now i have mirror envy! the mirror is much clearer and higher quality than a standard baby mirror. not only can we see our precious cargo with stunning clarity, he really seems to enjoy admiring himself! and anything that keeps baby happy during long car rides is a bonus! i don't have anything bad to say other than beware of mirror envy. i may be buying a second one soon!"
perfect for baby's room.
gave this as a gift and they loved it thus far...
awesome. comparing to the medela symphony.... just as strong maybe even stronger. love
"great mirror, nice a d big, can see baby much clearer now!"
very pleased
"this little bear was just the right size for a 2-year-old!  and it is just the softest, most cuddly little bear ever!  gund makes amazing stuffed animals.  i remembered from when my kids were little.  the best stuffed toys were gund.  this was a birthday present for my granddaughter.  she just loves it!"
My Daughter love her new room now
"Second time buying the cow, my dog ate the first one. He gets a little dingy because of the white but we just toss it in the wash machine and it comes out like new!"
"This is very good, I like it"
we love our wubbanub!!
"This was the pacifier used at the hospital so the twins have been used to them since birth. I like that it does not squish their nose. Soft, flexible material. Easy to clean. Good price point....I probably have 10 at this point because I go through several a day with twins and this way I don't keep playing &#34;find the pacifier&#34;. Make sure you note the sizes on the package, because with each size, the harder the rubber is and my babies definitely noticed the difference. To the point where they don't like the green ones (3-6 m) even though they are 4 months old."
"This is very good, I like it"
Both of our kids love these pacis.  They hold up well and clean nicely.
AWESOME~JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR~AND FAST SHIPPING!!!
Perfect compliment to the Avent bottles.
"My 7 week old loves these more than Any other brand. Not bulky and light, he can actually hang on to these as opposed to the all rubber/silicone ones."
Good
"Can't live without these. All of my kids were born &#34;tongue-tied&#34; and conventional stubby plugs never worked, they refused to use them. These are the only pacifiers my 3 kids would take. I think the length of the nipple is easier for a baby who has difficulty latching, where the conventional plugs are too short. A true in-the-store-at-midnight-cuz-you-lost-the-last-one kind of saving buy!"
Starting using this kind of pacifier with my son 4 years ago and we decided to use them for our second since we never had complaints. Designs on them are wonderful and very durable. My kids teeth are perfect
The best pacifiers for those middle of the night wake ups . they glow in the dark so they are easy to find.
"baby likes this wubba, and its a good shape for him to grasp and hold onto. It washes easily and came packaged as expected."
Really bright glow in the dark. I really wish my toddler didn't reject them. I recommend starting these out on a younger baby--not a 15 month old. He was too attached to the soothie. For my next baby I will def be switch to these right away. They are really good quality. It would really benefit any co sleepers!
"Our little guy is not a fan of any old pacifier, but he sure likes these! I like the natural product for him, and the texture is great when they start to gum and teeth too. Ordered their teether for that reason!"
My daughter's best friend :)
Great for baby shower!
Love it
"Good product, only pacifier my infant will take."
Love these little binkies! Best brand out there!
"Great product, great seller !!!"
Cute
Cute
"My baby loved these particular pacifiers compared to others. The plastic on the rim part is very hard, the sucking portion is medium-soft silicone and the pacifiers have a ring on them so you can easily move them around / strap them to something."
I got one of these pacifiers in the 0 months+ size free with the Chicco Keyfit 30 carseat. Of course it is the only pacifier my baby likes.
So cute and fun!
Good
"When I had my baby, we used the pacifier provided by the hospital (Avent Soothie) I noticed that the pacifier would go flying out of his mouth quite frequently. I did a lot of research on pacifiers and found out that the Avent Soothie is terrible for a babies developing mouth and can lead to many dental and orthodontic issues down the road. After my research, I decided to go with these and they are amazing. They are designed to fit your babies mouth properly. I will NEVER get another kind of pacifier. It never flies across the room when he is trying to suckle on it...hwill sleep all night with this in his mouth and have no issues. You should definitely get this over any other pacifier on the market."
Great product.
"I can't say this pacifier will work for every baby but it worked perfectly for our 8 week old. We tried the very popular green soothie starting week 3, and she just didn't like it. She'd push out of her mouth and if she did accept it, it usually fell out immediately. This pacifier is softer and flatter, which resembles a nipple more. The cover is also a bit curved, helping it stay in her mouth a bit longer. She really likes it and it's made nap time much easier, I highly recommend it!"
So cute and fun!
Great
Still use this type she's 1 yr old  buy lots of them since we tend to misplace them need a back-up at grandmas house!!
"Fast shipping, expected what showed up to my door. Second purchase of these for my girls. Needed a back up!"
"Wish I had one when my sons were born. It works great not only keeping the paci clean, it can hook on anything to keep it handy"
Perfect!  It's washable and convenient. Love that it's chemical free.
My little girl love these she can get a hold of them good and chew on them!
Cute baby item.  Went well with other items purchased
"Love love love love. There aren't enough words to express how much my 18 month old loves her 'puppies' as she calls them. We'e had to be about  6 since she's constantly hiding them or throwing them in the trash (not because she doesn't like them, just because she's only just discovered the trash). it's just a marvelous invention and my daughter goes to sleep immediately as long as she ha a couple of 'puppies' in her crib.<br /><br />We are great believers in pacifiers. (As is, since 2010, the American Association of Pediatricians). I know they're not for everyone, but taking our five year old's away when she was 2 was no problem at all - and some studies have shown they help prevent SIDS. Whatever you think about the pacifier itself, this is just a genius invention which gives my little girl all the comfort she needs to go to sleep soundly. (Thank God!)"
Love it! We can easily strap this in with the baby in her carseat and it keeps her pacified!
The real best Pacifier... we tried others and this is the winner for the baby
Well loved by baby
This was a gift. They loved it!
"This is the only pacifier our newborn will take & it's a lifesaver!  Ordered more the second we saw she liked them.  I do wish that you were able to choose the design, as we got the boy's. However, they all work the same, and we purchased for function.  The blue are still cute!"
"They work great for my younger one, and the fact they glow in the dark is awesome because I don't need to search for it anymore when they fall out his mouth. I haven't noticed in the last month that the glow itself bothers him or distracts him so thats great too."
Love them
I was pleased with them. I bought them as a gift for my brother and sister in-law. And they loved them too!
My son loves these. He also likes the newborn size better than the 0-6. I recommend parents try both sizes.
Great item! Thanks a lot!
Great item! Thanks a lot!
"This is the only kind of binky my daughter will take, so happy to be able to find them here."
"Losing a pacifier at night is a thing of the past. My daughter goes to sleep with a binky and then spits it out. Every time she wakes up and fusses, she just wants it back to go back to sleep. These are so easy to find and hold their &#34;glow charge&#34; for a long time. It is still glowing after 7 hours after just sitting out during the day."
We have had several of these. They are wonderful! We do not leave the house without them.
Love these cute novelty pacifiers!! Unique styles and made well. 5 stars for this seller even though it took longer to get than I thought. I definetly will get more as needed!
I purchased this for a co-worker who has a son due to be born this summer. An inexpensive gift idea that's BPA free and officially licensed by NCAA.
These are amazing and my babies favorite. I had some similar that had no loop to hook to her but these are so easy to find a paci attachment for and so soft for her to suck on.
My little man loves these things! I honestly didn't realize they were &#34;vanilla&#34; and it was an added perk.
Our baby finally seems to love these
Exactly as described.  Fast delivery
I love these pacifiers because of the natural rubber and my son prefers these over the plastic ones too.  They're super easy to clean.
Adorable
good item she loves them
Smells so good. my 6 month old loves it!
great thanks
Easy to clean.  1 piece of silicone means easier to sanitize too.
I honestly thought these were a joke and couldn't believe parents paid money for these. I'm hooked. These saved my sanity and precious time. I hardly have to binky hunt now! My son loves them. They are easily washed. No complaints!
"My daughter is 10 months old and she never really liked pacifiers. A friend came over with her son, born a week after my daughter, he was wearing a pacifier. Of course my daughter got curious and grabbed his pacifier and put it in her mouth and loved it ever since. I thought these were age appropriate since she knows how to suck a straw. Love them!!!"
Nice one for my one year old. I would certainly recommend  this product.
Haven't had water get inside of them like most and they don't fall out of my sons mouth. No cons as of yet
"Never disappointed!  I remembered having a pacifier pod 8 years ago that I loved, so I knew just what to order with this baby!! Best quality out there."
"Love that they glow in the dark! So convenient, and it really works!"
"Best pacifiers ever.  They're cute, safe, well constructed, gives Jr. something to hold onto (even a baby), and you'll never lose it, when he/she inevitably flings it 20 yards away.  We have the monkey, the duck, the Triceratops, and the Longhorn Bull.  Only needed one, but they're so darn cute!"
"Baby loves it, so I do too. :)"
I bought this WubbaNub for my great grandson and he loves it. This puppy is small enough for even the smallest of infants. He loves it because it gives him something to hold on to and the nipple is small enough and soft enough for him to use. Glad that I bought it for him.
"My favorite pacifier on the market. It's curved away from baby's face, which means less rash and fewer marks. It's all one piece, so it's easy to clean and you don't have to worry about moisture getting trapped. And frankly, it looks hilarious since it's see-through. These are all I use."
So cute! I just love it
"This is the best baby bottle sterilizer. It sterilizes 6 bottles at a time. It is not too big and bulky and best part of all, it dries the bottles. I have used other sterilizers that only sterilize and doesnt dry. This is a lifechanger. Also it is pretty quiet and doesnt make too much noise. Absolutley love it."
I don't know how my baby lived without this! She is 9 months old now and has been using it daily since she was 3 months. She prefers it to any other pacifier (and doesn't seem to mind that she's still using the &#34;small&#34; size). Such a smart design -- once they start grasping toys they can easily get this pacifier back into their mouth on their own without help.
This is such a cute pacifier. Used to have a duck but lost it so I ordered this and my little man loves it to. He loves holding onto the elephant leg.
The best in quality and my lil one only prefers these!
works excellent.
great 
"i love this necklace and so does my daughter. i feel like i can throw it on with any outfit and it look adorable. i get compliments every time i wear it. the other day we went to visit a friends new baby. i didn't want to bring a ton of stuff with me so i wore my mama & little necklace and it entertained my daughter the whole time. plus, she's always pulling on people's necklaces already so she loves that this is one she's actually allowed to chew on. i will definitely be ordering other stuff from this company in the future."
amazing for poopoo
"this pad is perfect for our gender neutral nursery.  we have a baby girl, but wanted things not too &#34;girly&#34;.  this print fits the bill nicely.  the material is soft and it washes beautifully.  stains come right out in normal washing. there didn't seem to be any shrinkage and the band has retained it's stretchiness, so that it fits the same over the pad every time."
it is exactly as described! working very well!
i love  it my grand baby  is eating  his cereal  out of  it
this was delivered super fast and came in great condition. there was a small nick on one of the drawers but i used a little white out and it covered it. i love the look of these and they were pretty easy to put together.
"this is a great baby monitor for the price.  we were looking to purchase a video monitor since our daughter began climbing out of her crib.  my sister in-law recommended this model, and we decided to give it a shot.  it is very easy to set-up and use.  i can even bring this camera outside when i'm in the yard, and it keeps its signal.  definitely a keeper!"
my child loved this.
looked all over for a pad to replace the one that came on my daughter's bed/changing table combo.  price and shipping were very agreeable!
very easy application and removal without wall damage. the colors are bright and vivid.
this was my sons favorite teether and toy. he loves the crinkle sound the &#34;bunny ears&#34; make
good
good
good product
good
this works perfectly with my medela pump. i love that the flange is one piece so there is less to wash! i would recommend this product!
this stroller is worth the money. no need to get a expensive stroller  with different seats that attach to the same frame. this is all in one.  converts to a pram and will lay flat.  it's easy to entertain my 7 month old in this stroller while we are at all day sport meets for my older son.  i recommended this to a friend and she loves it too. great product.
wonderful for a 5 year-old who is still light in weight.
this pillow is the perfect size for toddler heads. my daughter loves it.
cool
love this stuff for my cloth dipaers. i use as preventative before i get an ammonia stink that some of my fellow cd mama's complain of. i use this packet in clean diapers every three months and never have had an absorbance issue or ammonia stink.
super useful! it came in time and perfectly good!
bought this for a girlfriends baby shower and it is just so cute! i have also purchased this before for my sister. its a hit!
so nice
my baby loves this!  it's soft and snugly.  she takes naps in it daily.  and o can take it on road trips so she has a place to lounge. wish they made it in adult size!
kids love them
"work better than the others, no air in the tummy to cause a fussy baby"
works great but i wish they were a little longer.
this was a much appreciated gift
"this thing is nifty. had that &#34;new&#34; smell, i expect that to fade. mini perforations for breathability, do not know about waterproof-ness yet. great for a short rifle wrap or headscarf."
:))))))
works perfectly for our 15 month old and she will continue to fit without the insert as she grows. straps attach it easily to a dining chair.  the storage of the tray under the chair is a great feature.
i am incredibly content with this bag. it is very spacious and perfect for an over packer like myself.  it definitely has some weight to it empty and even more being over packed but i don't mind it at all.  not like i carry it all the time.  it's perfect!
i was very please with this gift. i bought it for a friends daughter when her baby was being christened. he loved it so much that they actually brought it to the christening and he was grabbing it during the ceremony which  of course meant a lot to me. they said it seemed to make him  settle down and not cry. i liked it so much i bought another to keep on hand for the next christening of a friends child.
too cute !!!!
great product
very satisfied
"love these bibs.. great coverage, easy to put on/take off, lightweight, and easy to clean!  and cute patterns :) what more can a mom ask for?"
"good wet bag, adorable design. i got the foxy frolic print which has a white background, and because this is a single layer bag, it's rather see through. i use this for my cloth diapers, and while i haven't had a problem yet, i could see messes smearing inside and being visible through the bag. while it's not going to go through the material, it'd be kinda gross to see. or, if you have an easily embarrassed child, their wet underwear could be seen through the lighter material.<br /><br />i actually prefer the lite wet bag over the double layer wet bag by planet wise (i bought the double layer style first - 2 large and 1 medium). the double layer bags tends to collect and hold water in the waterproof side during the wash cycle and it's an extra step to get the liner fully empty and reset into the cloth outer bag so it can fully dry. plus, i tend to wonder if the water that is trapped in the liner side is clean or not. this bag being a single layer is much easier to flip inside out and back again."
good
the little attached pouch is great. it was easy to fold-up and carry the bag through the airport until it was time to cover the stroller before boarding our flight. it definitely kept our umbrella stroller in good condition traveling internationally.
they should be very proud of their product.  better than described.  wonderful.  thank you so much. patty
love it- so cute & fun!
i bought it as a gift for an expectant mom and i believe it will be perfect for organizing her car.
holds the perfect amount of wipes for long trips but fits really easily into the diaper bag.
this is truly good for the toddler beginning to learn how to brush
"very convenient and roomy, lightweight and can fit a ton of stuff in her. so happy with purchase"
these are beautiful and will go with anything (especially darker wood).  very sturdy and safe!
outstanding!
"i have no issues with this mattress. my daughter isn't a very picky baby, but she sleeps very well on it. just the right about of firmness. not extremely firm and not too soft. and it's waterproof!"
"great product, high quality and works like a charm."
worked great!
beautiful finish and coordinate well with any decor.
perfect size
good price and it came fast thank you!
they are huge and cover to his pants. which is perfect cause he drop food in the high chair all the time. perfect and cute. a little pricey but very bright and colorful.
"great saves the sheets, doesn't leak!"
amazing!  our 4mo old is loving walks now.  we used the car seat but he was never really comfortable in it.  this has made a huge difference!  wish we had bought it earlier!
"love the cover and the color. my son keeps grabbing at the material while feeding, and it's a bit hot (in a hot and humid climate like singapore) but i have remained covered and can see what's going on beneath."
very nice!
"i brought this bag in intentions to carry all of my reusable menstrual pads, it worked greatly! even with my collection growing i still always have room in this bag.  however, one &#34;con&#34; is that it doesn't keep heavy odors out well enough, good enough though, i still love it.<br /><br />nice and waterproof, no leeks, however i haven't really tested that. but a great bag!"
cute
"I love this calendar. It's beautiful, gender neutral, and a great keepsake. It's so easy to jot things down quickly so I can remember my baby's milestones, firsts, likes, dislikes, schedule, etc. it's much easier to record than an actual baby book. I have the matching book which is beautiful but I haven't touched it. This on the other hand is in use often. I'm glad I have it as this time is going so fast I would most definitely forget some of these memories if I didn't have it."
Always a great product.
Love these pacifiers!!!!
"Love it, very well made material!"
This is the only pacifier our daughter will use. We love it
Very nice product! Baby loves it!
i bought these for my nephew. he's 7 months now and for the past 2 he's been able to hold these well. they have places for little hands to grab and the colors are bright. i recommend these.
excellent
love it! prompt shipping.
this is such a 'why didn't i think<br />of that?!' product. perfect for schlepping my wiggly 2year old through airports on international flights..
"awesome. these give me so much ,ore space in my dish washer, and the parts lok cleaner too. it has a spot for the bloe valves at the botom of the bottle too."
first of all i received this 5 days earlier than i expected. as a first time mom i want the best for my little one & many recommended this for me. my little one is due in 6 weeks so i don't know if it's good or not but i've been doing a lot of research & it seems like it is.
simple and cute.
fits pillow fine.
"Love it. Great size, easly sanatized and washed. Very easy to handle!"
"My boy loves them, easy transitioning between breast and paci, no nipple confusion."
Have used these for all three of our boys.  For some reason they seem to be able to keep it in their mouths more easily
Great tried many pacifiers and these were my son's favorite
This was a baby shower gift and she loved it.
"Best pacifiers available :) Only thing to be aware of is that this is an infant pacifier, meaning they are easily chewed up once your child has teeth."
Cute Idea
Very cute. I love it
My kiddo is OBSESSED.  These are the best.
Great Purchase!!
"Although my suga mama is way too old for this pacifier it is soooo cute and I love when she says where is her herraife, we did loose it but it was way worth it."
Haven't used this yet as baby comes in Sept. but yhe idea is fantastic. I saw this on Shark Tank and ordered it while the episode was still on.
"Price is good, these are nice to have on hand."
The glow in the dark feature is great!
This item was shipped just as cute as it was pictured online and I already told new mothers to purchase it cause I work in a hospital thanks
My baby started using at two months.  Much better than Havana brand.  Round nipple is most like my nipple so deters less from breastfeeding.  The rubber is much more pliable and soft.  The mouthpiece is much bigger than all other pacifiers...my baby prefers it...it stays in her mouth better and more imitates how the breast fits in her mouth (sits at the back of mouth)...very happy with product and hard couple days when we lost it and had to use whatever natural rubber brand local store carried until new ecopiggy was delivered.
good
My daughter really liked this since she didn't have one for her first pregnancy.<br />Looks to be a safer way to dispense medicine.
They are great to have
All my kids have loved these things. It makes it easier for babies to find and grab it if they drop them in their car seat or crib. We've even cut the pacifier end off when the kids got older so they could keep sleeping with the animal.
"Gave as gift, loved it."
Perfect for babies that don't like silicone nipples.  I've had the paci for a month now and my child prefers to gum it down.  It better than nothing and it is still intact.
"These are way more expensive than the Soothies we usually buy, but we think they are totally worth it for the laughs alone. These pacifiers are good quality, and they even come with covers so they don't get dirty."
"best pacifier, made in germany btw."
Cute and fun... something soft to hold onto and easy to clean.
My son loves the Wubbanub!  It's so easy for him to grab and put back in his mouth. And it's easy to keep track of!  And they are so cute!
excellent product
excellent product
Perfect game for the kids in a baby shower
"My granddaughter loves her WubbaNub!  So I always buy 2 for the baby showers I am invited to.  So far my favorites are the elephant, the lamb, and the Christmas reindeer."
"I love these little MAM pacifiers.  They are curved, so they fit babies face instead of poking away from the face.  This makes it less likely that the baby will yank the pacifier out of her mouth.  Also, because there is no &#34;ring&#34; attached to the front, that also makes it less likely that the baby will yank it out of her mouth.  Since these are for 0-6 month old babies, they are smaller on the outside, and the nipple they suck on is also smaller so it does not gag them like the bigger ones.  I have had a hard time getting my 4-month-old to take the pacifier, and this one works the best out of all the various types we have tried.  We have tried about 6 different types/sizes/brands."
Best pacifiers EVER..
"As always, love our wubbies :)"
excellent product
this chair is awesome. it's so comfortable. i bought this for my daughter and she just loves it.
my daughter love this walker. i had to order another for the babysitter's house.
"excellent fit, easy to clean & provides protection for cream leather seating."
the design is very simple and the quality is very good.
Adorable!
I bought these the first time when I had my oldest son and he loved it. He refused to take any other pacifier. I purchased them again for my second and he loves them too!
Excellent! Product just as described. Arrived as expected. Will definitely buy more to add to our WubbaNub collection!
"Wonderful! Button glows almost all night long, so I can find it in the middle of the night!"
excellent product
My daughter is 3 months and she LOVES her kitty :) this is the only paci she can put back in her mouth herself when it falls out and hold in place. She's still developing her motor skills do she can't always get it in but I don't have the problem where the paci falls on the floor.
Great pacifiers. Love the colors.
Bought as a gift so haven't really used it.
So cute!!
Fits a pacifier and nipple shield perfectly!
only ones my 5 week old will take right now
"My newborn girl loves this pacifier. The first time she tried it was at the hospital and they gave me 2 of them to take home, since the one they give are the standart blue with MAM written on it, I wanted something cute for my girl, so I bought from another brand that looked way nicer, but my baby wouldn't take it, so I checked online and found these and I love that they're exactly the same shape than the pacifier they gave me at the hospital but super cute."
I love love love WubbaNub's. We have seven babies in my family and they all have different ones. This one was for my son. He is no longer using binkies but this was the only one he would take ever! We called him Nigel :) Great things for baby to hold onto and very easy to wash! I always just put mine in the dishwasher! Over about 16ish months I bought 3 or 4 of them but totally worth it!
Great bottles! I've never had leaking issues.
pretty good
Super cute and easy to find..
"These glow-in-the-dark pacifiers have made our lives SO much easier. A toddler losing her pacifier in the middle of the night has resulted in screaming, crying and more than just her upset at a God-forseen hour. Now she can often find it herself, and when she can't, we are able to sneak in, locate it, pop it back in and sneak out before she fully wakes up and hits the point of no return. Ingenious!! Now if they just had a GPS sensor for when she walks around the house and throws it down somewhere..."
good
Love these pacifiers after Nicu stay
i love this and it soooo cute I lose these ones less
I am obsessed with giving my son wubb-a-nubs and this little guy was an awesome stocking stuffer.
Great baby shower gift!
"11 month old son loves this!  I bought this specifically for a long car ride (after seeing on Shark Tank!) and this kept him occupied, and happy, for a good portion of the ride! I've also gotten several compliments on this from the teachers at daycare :)"
My daughter loved this gift for my new granddaughter. The cute little lamb helps the pacifier stay put close to the baby's mouth.
My son loves all the wubbanubs he has. They are very convenient for me as well because they are easier to find then the regular pacifiers.
Awesome :) daughter loves it! It's her 4th one
"Loveeeeeee,loveeeee loveeee.my son loves it and it is so easy for him to find it during the night .and it is cute"
"MAMs are the best pap-paps out there! If you're an inexperienced parent, do yourself and your baby a favor and buy nothing but MAMs from now on!"
My niece loves this brand of pacifiers and they are easy to find in the dark.  Bonus!
"My baby loves MAM pacis, they seem to be easier for her to keep in her mouth.  Another brand, Soothies, always fall out, like she's having trouble keeping them in.  These pacifiers are super-cute, and I love that they glow in the dark.  If she loses them at night, it's easy to find them without turning on a light.  I would definitely, definitely buy these again."
Love these - they're my favorite!
"MAMs are the best pap-paps out there! If you're an inexperienced parent, do yourself and your baby a favor and buy nothing but MAMs from now on!"
We have tried what seems like every pacifier out there and this worked best for our baby. We love it because it stayed in her mouth when she stopped sucking which helped her fall asleep soothing herself. Other pacifiers seemed to pop right out of her mouth the moment she wasn't actively sucking. Highly recommend!
so cute!
Great service and love this product.
My Grand daughter loved it
"as you probably know, most babies reject several kinds of passerfiers, then finally settle on one that they like, and you stop trying to find more. These were it for our baby.  They are wider and flatter than most- i think he liked that.  I like that there is no designated up or down, makes putting it back in easier.  Good luck!!"
"So cute, what a great idea. Im going to get more."
Nice
OK
These pacifiers attach to a lot of clips! My LO loved them!
Nice
"Every kid is different, but my little guy has loved his Wubbanubs from day 1. He wraps his little hands around their legs, he hugs it to his body. We try any other pacifier and he spits it out (even the Soothies that are identical to the one attached to the Wubbanub!)."
"Wish I would have thought of this first! Great idea, but the price is a little ridiculous I think!"
These have a much softer texture than your standard binkie and I like that they don't have a bunch of mysterious plastic ingredients. I do wish they would last longer though.
good
"Very cute, was a baby shower gift."
My son loves wubbanubs! They are just big enough that he actually will hug them and holds them in place. Plus their extra size makes it easy to find (even in the middle of the night or at the bottom of the purse)
"Our baby girl loves this, life saver. The weight of the stuffed animal is the best quality of this product because if she pops it out of her mouth it stays put so it doesn't fall on the ground."
"This sterilizer is a little pricey, but I'd say it is worth it if you can afford it. I sterilize my baby's bottles daily and I love how easy it is. The best part is that it offers a drying feature. It is easy to operate and clean as well. The sterilization cycle sometimes takes longer than 8 minutes (my maximum has been almost 16 minutes so far), which to me is alright. The bottles come out clean, dry, and ready to use."
Best pacifier ever
Expensive but so worth it if you're looking for a safe pacifier.
"Love this little pacifier giraffe! Got it for my grandson and it is one of the things that is always near him in the stroller or in his baby swing. So soft, colorful and cute!"
"The best, my daughter won't use any other pacifiers."
best pacifier to smooth your baby
So handy to have on the diaper bag!
good product and good seller
good product and good seller
good
the crib mattress was a perfect for the crib. i feel very comfortable that my grandbaby will sleep comfortably and safely on this mattress.
"it does what it's supposed to. i would buy one for a friend of they didn't have one. i'm sure you can use it for other brands than britax, but the fact that they crash test with these is important to me. it holds well and protects the seats. to install you just set it on the seat and plop the base on top of it. easy. other reviewers commented on a smell but ours smelled fine... like a new pair of shoes. no complaints."
adorable boppy cover!!
love it! just wish it had a messenger strap.
So cute my babys love these. I think probably because it's got a stuffed animal my son's love to cuddle it.
i put two of them in my tub.  they stay in place very well.  always check the stability before putting weight on it.
"love this.  i started my daughter off in this at 3 months old and she loved being able to see everything at the grocery store and i loved being able to shop with just a cart as opposed to cart and stroller or cart with car seat in it.  she moves her arms and legs a lot in excitement when she is in this so she is getting exercise too.  now she is 8 months and it still works great.  adjusts easy, easy to put on, front and outward facing.  it gets a little warm though from sharing body heat so i don't think this is a great thing for summer."
beautiful!
"i scoured the reviews of all the other top reusable pouches out there of this size, and decided to try these. i'm glad i did, and don't have any complaints so far after using them regularly for many weeks.<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />you can't beat clear.<br />they are relatively easy to close.<br />no leaks so far.<br />they are super easy to fill.<br />they can use tops that come on the store-bought pouches (stock up while you're still using them!)<br />super easy to clean and fit a standard bottle brush easily.<br />they do not hold food stains, even tomatoes. (i forgot a blended spaghetti and meat sauce pouch in the fridge for a week and thought i'd have an orange-stained bag for sure. nope! no food residue or color was left behind with a normal washing. really, really impressive).<br />my 17 month old can hold it, no problem.<br />it is difficult to make a mess with these. you'd have to step on it, or make the contents pretty watery in order for stuff to leak out if it drops.<br />it's strong, thick plastic.<br />it's big enough to feed an adult as well as a hungry kid.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />the only con is that it can be difficult for my toddler to empty the bag without help, since it's relatively rigid plastic. i usually just squeeze the bottom, fold it in half, and wrap a hair tie around it to hold it so the stuff doesn't fall to the bottom of the bag where he can't suck it out. i don't see this as a design flaw, though. it seems expected for a larger sized bag of higher-quality and thicker plastic."
this is perfect
"so far i love it! definitely like it better than the nosefrida one that i had before. love the carrying case(so convenient), the soft tip for the baby's nose, how small it is, no filters needed, and its easy peasy to clean. i am planning on buying this as a baby shower gift for all the new mamas :) and probably one more for myself(so i can have one for the diaper bag and one on the changing table)."
"i ordered this recipe book as  it was a much better value, saved quite a lot.  there are a lot  better of smoothie recipes in there so have a large choice."
works great
"lovely quality, holds up well to the frequent washing that is inevitable with a baby, the colors stay true and the material doesn't pill like cheap clothing."
"perfect as described. loved the colors, pattern and design!"
very nice item- definitely a cut above cheap pacifiers- natural materials make a huge difference. my baby girl likes it.
absolutely love these cups. i've bought them for everyone i know that has toddlers.
soft and cuddly. the blanket is so soft and could be used all year long.
These weren't for me. It was a present for someone expecting a newborn. But she seemed pleased with them: cute and conveniently stored and BPA-free!
Like it !! Perfect for baby's little toys and pacifier.
love the quality and design of these crib sheets!
my son loves this kids table and chair set. it was very easy to put together and is the perfect height for his age.
excellent all
the best of best. i recommend 100%
"awesome.  as others have stated,install upside down.  my son is no longer able to open the doors and the lock stays in place unlike the type that attach with sticky strips.  highly recommend."
my son loves it! it's worth the purchase!
"our go-to sleep sack. easy to zip, and cool enough for warmer months."
"beautiful crib, fairly easy to assemble. promptly arrived on my door step. highly recommend, totally worth the money."
this blanket is almost 4 years old and my daughter is still carrying it around..this is the blanket that became her security blanket. it is still in great condition aside from the dingy coloring and softness loss over time.
"product arrived two days earlier and in great condition.  box came with an extra pair of batteries, haven't tried those yet. the train illuminates quite nice, just the right amount so you can distinguish all the train details."
great booster-great price
works perfect. holds all my son's stuffed animals perfectly above his bed.
"i got this today. my baby isn't here yet, but so far i am really happy with this bassinet. it was easy enough to set up and looks like it will be perfect for next to the bed. i plan to use the cover to make sure my cat doesn't try to jump in, but i think it will also be great for the summer, if we ever want to just sit out on the porch or take a trip to the park. the pad that comes with this is not terribly thick, but i think it is perfectly fine for a baby. i ordered a bassinet mattress to go with this but i don't think i'll keep it and will send it back. the one that comes with it recommends not to use additional padding as it could be unsafe if it does not fit properly or is too soft. i'd rather be safe and just use the one that comes with it. i really don't think she's going to be spending the majority of her time in there anyway.<br />overall so far, i'm happy with this purchase. the color is what i expected and could be used for a boy or girl. the quality is good, and the product is pretty much what i was expecting. if anything changes, i'll update my review."
perfect for my 4 year old and my big boys (12 & 16) like them too
very good
came quick and its as shown
my baby's pacifier kept falling out of his mouth in the car seat so i ordered this hoping to help keep it near his mouth for him to find when it does fall out. he loves it and it's worked well so far
"love these burp cloths! they are super absorbent and soft, and they fit nicely on your shoulder!"
"very well pleased,and baby ,too!!!"
"this is a neat baby bed!  i love that we can roll it from room to bed, it fits very nicely through the door frame.  we've found it works amazingly well with the baby monitor, we just aim the monitor at the mirror end and we can see the whole bed clearly.  i like the smaller size since our granddaughter only visits occasionally and this is very easy to store.  the mattress is a nice thickness and fits snugly in the bed.  couldn't be happier with the purchase!"
my grandson loves his new batman car seat!  good quality!
great bottles!  i handwash the nipples because one discolored from our water in the dishwasher.  i put them through a microwave sterilizer afterwards (we have well water so we have to use boiled water or sterilize to kill any possible bacteria).
"my 5 year old son can put his seatbelt on easily, and i feel safe knowing he's in the 5 point harness.  the quality of diono really beats out other car seats and is worth the price.  the buckles really prove to be more secure than other leading car seats."
"really wonderful drool bibs! i've had many over the course of three kiddos, and these are by far my favorite. the wetness really doesn't soak through to the other side. it is very very soft to rub against baby's sweet skin. i have washed a dried and they have continued in great quality, keeping perfect shape. and they are adorable. i highly recommend. i would use these designs for both boy or girl. will be giving as gifts."
great for saving toys from falling out of stroller or car seat!
good~
super happy. i thought i only ordered one case but got 4 for this price!  look exactly like the picture and love the how they feel. they fit perfect on my galaxy s4
good~
"i like it, specially the smaller brush at the back side to walk nipples"
"excellent sleep sack for warm nights.  the material is like a thick soft t-shirt, and the wide top to bottom zipper and snaps on the shoulders make it easy to get on and off.  we like it so much we bought another.  we also have the regular thickness sleep sack for cool nights and highly recommend both.  they are worth the extra expense."
"i love the original bumgenius elemental. unfortunately they are hard to find and can be quite expensive if purchased new. i heard about smart bottoms and that they were similar so i gave them a try. now they make up the majority of my stash.<br />they are usa made. soft, absorbent organic cotton inner. fast drying time (for an aio). the fit is great and thy come in cute colors and prints. plus the re sale value is high. can't go wrong with these."
"My two year old loves his Mickey backpack! He's had it since Christmas and uses it every day to transport his toys around. No sign of any wear and tear. Literally, no sign. It's the best $10 I spent last Christmas. : )"
My daughter loves these and she can put them in her own mouth at only 4 months
I saw this on Shark Tank and bought it for my granddaughter who is expecting her first child.<br />Can't wait to have her try it out!
Super cute
Love these pacifiers. I used these with my son when he was a baby almost 10 yrs ago and I always recommend them to breastfeeding moms.
Super cute pacifiers. My baby loves them.
Best pacifier! My newborn could hold it in her mouth almost immediately.
Awesome! Easy to find and easy for my baby to hold on to. He is now 6 months and uses it at sleep times only.
We love WubbaNubs!
great fits perfectly in the playpen
i really like this belt for my son who's 18 months (weighs 27lbs). i like the ease of the belt and not having to worry about poking holes in belts that are too big.
"my husband and i had a miscarriage last year, so when we realized we were pregnant this year, we started searching for a baby monitor we could safely use to give us some peace of mind during the early-mid pregnancy. we asked our doctor about this product and he said it was safe, as long as we didn't over use it. so we didn't! we only used it a couple of times a week, for a max of 5 minutes sessions.<br />i was only 10 weeks when my husband and i started using it and though sometimes we could find the heartbeat immediately, other nights we just had to give up looking after 5 minutes.<br />i read that you probably need to start using it later on in pregnancy, but it worked for me on the 10th week. :)"
lifesavers! specially while outside.
it was perfect.
cute fitted sheet. very happy with the purchase.
"i am a mother to 5, including 12 week old twins. this is my first time using bottles (older kids breastfed exclusively), so i started with the ones made by the pump manufacturer and used at the hospital. one twin was having a tough time with those nipples, so we switched to dr brown. that twin seemed to do better with dr brown, but the other twin didn't like those (the nipple is narrow), so i ordered these born free bottles. both twins did so well with these! i really like that they are wide mouth, which makes cleaning easier. although they do have five parts of you count everything separately, it is so easy to take them apart and put them together --- really it only takes a few seconds --- that i personally don't consider it a problem whatsoever! i think the system for preventing air gulping a highly effective, and that and the nipples work so well!  i did move onto the glass version of these but still use the plastic and like to take the plastic in the diaper bag just because they're lighter. i love both the plastic and the glass and highly recommend these to anyone. i quickly put away all of the other brands and have been exclusively using the born free since about a week after i bought that first set."
"this drying rack is fantastic! it can hold so many bottles, pump parts, and pacifiers.  helps keep the clutter down to a minimum on the counter, which is a huge help when bottle feeding."
love the size of this walker.
"work well. my 17 month old daughter got the hang of it before i did. 99% spill proof. there have been a very few scenarios where there was some leakage, but overall, this cup performs very well. i trust it to do the job."
arrived on time and i loved it. fabric is of good quality and covers car seat very well.
son loves easy for him to play with
use daily! work great!
great product. easy to install my daughters crib is next to an outlet that we put this on. it has done its job. ordered another one for the baby we are expecting now.
my 6 year old daughter loves this cup and frozen
"i was a little hesitant on ordering after reading that others didn't receive authentic medela adaptors. ordered it anyway. real medela part. works great, happy with replacement."
the spout allows you to put pre-measured preferred formula into even skinny bottles with no mess.
the product is good
"love these locks, they work great!"
can't wait to give this cute bib & booties set
this is my second set of bumkin bibs. i love how they are easy to use and wash. you can toss them into the washer and get them extra clean. i've accidentally thrown them in the dryer before and they're fine.
"love, love these changing pads. they are perfect sized and soooo easy to wash. lightweight and you can take them anywhere with you!"
i love blueberry simplex diapers! this one is so adorable!
"easy to hold, can be use with hot or cold beverages. quality is pretty good, thicker than our other stainless steel cups and prettier too. highly recommended!"
love this product
"this bed is amazing! my daughter is 20 months old and we do a lot of traveling. it fits perfect in hotel rooms. it is a little bulky, but worth carrying around. she loves it so much she pulls it out at nap time at home! very happy with our purchase!"
"these were delivered in a timely fashion and in good condition.  they have served my needs well.  i use them to put in places where i normally get rashes especially in hot weather because i have areas where skin touches skin.  these absorb the moisture caused by this and the antibacterial properties probably help too:  result, no more rashes!"
these were fantastic valences put i would of had to change rods and more holes in walls lol so i had to send back but they are prompt and exactly what they say they are thanks
works great for my tall 3.5 year old and my smaller 5 month old ;)
great
my wife loves this... i mean absolutely loves this. so she's happy... which means i'm happy...
its adorable! the boats on the base are so so cute!
"we purchased this product for our finicky newborn as a hail mary. nothing was helping him (or us get any sleep).<br /><br />i initially had no intention of using the vibrating feature as other vibrating contraptions didn't last long enoughenough or shut off abruptly and woke up our sleeping baby. but in this rocker, it is just an on/off switch. this thing has been going on the first battery install for a month and a half and still going. it vibrates overover night, we've even forgot to turn it off in between naps etc.<br /><br />the first night we put him in it was one if the best sleeps we've had. it didn't solve all our problems, but alleviated them.<br /><br />we have since learned that our little man has acid reflux and the angle if this rocker was just the thing.<br /><br />so in summary:<br />1.  love the angle for acid reflux<br />2. love the continuous vibrator<br />3. it's not a battery guzzler<br />4. love that we now are getting sleep."
great product
"i have tried many, many breast milk storage bags and by far i like honeysuckle bags the best. the quality of the bags are great. thicker plastic, double seal top that has never failed me yet and easy to write on surface. the shape of the bags are perfect for easy pouring and great for freezing flat and stacking. i had trouble with the other bags not having a wide enough opening to pour the milk into, having a weird shape which made freezing them flat not really beneficial since i got rounded frozen popcicles that keeps toppling over when stacked, and flimsy plastic side seals that made worried about them tearing. so far i have not had any leakage or breakage issues with any of the brands i have tried and i'm lucky in that aspect. i've heard and read about many people who have experienced leaking bags which is frustrating since it's very tough on our bodies to make &#34;liquid gold&#34;.<br />i purchased these 50 bags to try along with all the other brands and loved these best and it was the best price per bag as well! i was sad to find out they weren't selling through amazon due to some issue. but i was able to buy it directly from the company in bulk of 600 bags! different design, but still great quality and i'm extremely satisfied! over 800 ounces of &#34;liquid gold&#34; bagged so far ^_^"
i love these bags. i steam everything once a week. the bags make cleaning easy and quick.
good buy for my baby.
We needed another one and this fit the need. Who know why but it has become the new favorite.
"My little one loved this pacifier, it is like a Soothie (which she loves) but does not hit her in the nose and you can easily put a pacifier holder on it."
"I never thought I would purchase this, but it's been a ilfesaver. Now I always have an extra pacifier on hand, and I don't have to dig through my huge diaper bag to find an extra - comes in handy when baby is screaming and her pacifier is nowhere to be found!  It's not absolutely necessary, but it has made life easier more than once! It also matches my diaper bag perfectly."
MaM is the only brand my kids would happily take.
The only pacifiers my son will use. No idea why they are so hard to get. They really are great for breast fed babies. No nipple confusion
These are the only pacifier my breastfed son would take. We literally tried them ALL. I love how it's nipple shaped to resemble mom.
So cute!
"Tried Avent soothies, and baby didn't care for them at all  than Mam, baby liked much better, than tried Nuk and these were her favorite"
My baby accepted them from the first moment!
my grand daughter love this but i do have  some concern about cleaning it. But i really like this idea
so cute!!!
great product!!
necessity for new baby care. this thing is awesome!
kids love this - especially the remote control.
"i have a 5 year old grand daughter and black leather seats,  which always had marks from her shoes...no more plus there is a place for her stuff.  i love them and so does my grand daughter.  thank you."
"my husband and i have found this product to be very helpful and have recommended it to others.  the concept is a little strange the first time you go to use it, but you quickly get used to it.  it also does not upset our newborn daughter as much as an aspirator would."
my new go to baby gift! i bought my daughter the hippo and she loved it so much i bought this sweet lamb for my niece. the stuffed animal is so soft and the book is adorable. i also bought the spotted dog for a cousins baby. love these sets
love this color! runparooz and thirsties are my fave covers and they do not fail! i love that the newborn is adjustable and fits up to 15 lbs i think m
"exactly what i needed; fast delivery, thank you!"
"i have the grey and sangria wraps. i love both, but the grey is a bit more versatile. at first i had a lot of difficulty wrapping when my baby was a newborn, but after about a week i got the hang of it (after watching some good youtube videos) and love it. it's so simple and adjusts as your baby grows."
the pictures do not do these justice!  they are adorable!
i love them 
easy to use
"works well, push down on it when placing it on the seat for suction and it hold great. easy to clean. very happy with my purchase"
"my 1.3yrs old son is obsessed with cars, and a fussy eater. this speed up eating and keep him on the table for long enough to finish his meal.<br /><br />the quality is excellent. worth the prince."
my pediatrician recommended bandanas for my teething son and these don't disappoint.  i love the designs!
"these really work. at around 7 months, our daughter had started sleeping through the night really well, except that meant she would pee through her diaper every night (and sometimes wake up wet, sometimes sleep through wet clothes), so i got these, and now she sleeps through the night without leaking! she hates being wet, so she sometimes still wakes for us to change it, but it doesn't get out of the diaper, and she goes right back down after we put on another one of these. besides these, we only use the &#34;natural&#34; brands of diapers, but it was so worth it to get these."
"this was the best purchase for the money....$58 and it is sturdy, colorful, spacious, easy to clean, bright and very cheery....my great grandson, mackson, enjoys it thoroughly when visiting great grammy.....don't hesitate if you are thinking of buying a playard...36&#34;x36&#34;...lots of room to play in."
"my son is a pretty active sleeper, and we were having trouble with him kicking out of his blankets, getting cold, and waking us up.  these pajamas (particularly the long sleeved ones) solved that issue.  my son sleeps comfortably, and i don't have to get up as often in the night, as he is still warm, even if he kicks out of his blankets."
"we purchased this monitor after having tried a mobicam monitor which we returned after learning that the camera could not be moved to view our son. we have been incredibly pleased with this monitor, and use it all the time to check on our son - we even take it with us when we travel. the setup is easy and convenient, and several of our friends have purchased the monitor after seeing how nice ours is!"
adorable
"the package was in perfect condition, did not look squished or anything like it sometimes can get in transit. when i took my dream out of the package it was very soft and perfect!! no snags or pulls. i was nervous to wash it because i didn't want to ruin it!! but i washed it on hand wash on cold and dried on delicate. my daughter took to it right away (she loves her swaddles) i can't wait to buy more!! (;"
these are so soft and a great size. we use them constantly.
babies love this toy! it crinkles and has all different textures on all 5 corners. definitely a must have.
"i bought this to replace my old diaper bag. i was looking for something more roomy and organized. this bag is perfect, it is so easy to find what you are looking for and the messenger bag style is helpful when trying to carry baby! my only complaint is that the wipes get stuck sometimes when i'm trying to pull them out, but they are still moist."
This Gate was very useful in preventing our child from entering the kitchen and to keep him contained :) in the child proof living room where he can play with his toys and run around.<br /><br />I really like how it is easy to adjust and it fits firmly at the entrance to the kitchen. Later we will move it to the baby's room and I believe it will be easy to adjust the gate to the door width which is really convenient.
I love it!
I love this product as my two older boys used it when they were babies. Now having the 3rd son I needed for my son. its soothing pacifier and I love it how it doesn't hurt the baby's mouth..
"We love wubbanubs, and this one is cute & unique.  I like to have several because I wash them in batches on the gentle cycle, in a lingere bag with Dreft.  That keeps them from getting too funky.  My one year old is OBSESSED with these &#34;doos,&#34; because they are easy for her to find and manipulate.  Way more affordable on Amazon, than at a specialty baby store.  Thanks AMAZON, you're my huckleberry!"
"this is a really great color, and was fairly east to put up. does it's job keeping my 8 month old from sticking his feet through the slats on his crib and getting them stuck. stays up pretty well even with my son trying to climb it when he wakes up from his nap - just needs a little tug to get it back into place."
ok
my favorite brand of cloth diapers. and we tried a lot of brands.
"our son is 19 months and still sleeping in a sleepsack, this one works great, and it keeps him from climbing out of his crib!"
excellent product and universal to fit any application.  the fabric is durable and pliable.  i was exhausted of trying to find a car seat protector that was not rigid and plagued with glue/seat marking problems. when i found this one it solved all my problems and i was super excited... and when i installed it i was even happier!
nice for our grandson...nice thick and very vibrant colors...he loved it...
"adorable.  for the price, very cute and soft, my son loved it."
looks exactly the same.
"bassinet is solid, easy to set up and take apart!"
my daughter loved it.  i put it in the easter basket for the upcoming baby.
perfect... a bit big if you have a small car so order with caution.
"gorgeous and simple. perfect for a little baby girl. i've given one to both of my god daughters at their baptisms. hoping to start a family tradition, i'll be ordering a blue one in a few months for our next addition, and his too will be brought to church to be blessed alongside our family during his baptismal ceremony.   a little extra info on the product itself, since i've had 2 now, for those like me, who'd like as much info as possible when ordering online: the little porcelain case each rosary sits in is slightly different each time, and does not close tightly. it is meant to just sit on top, so it will not &#34;secure&#34; the rosary. the pieces will come in a small box, perfect for wrapping or putting into a tiny bag (gift idea...i usually add a crib ornament with this and it's a complete gift for any newborns' baptism). the inside is wrapped in small bubble wrap, so it is packaged and shipped very nicely. there is a little pink pillow, blue for boy, and then the little rosary. it is literally sent to you ready to be wrapped up, or hand delivered as is. i hope this helps. th trees really nothing else to mention about this product. feel free to ask."
"works great.  i always buy these!  i am a dog sitter, so i use mine quite a lot.  i watch pretty big dogs.  so after a while, they obviously wear out, but i keep buying them because before they wear out, they work great.  you don't have to put any holes in your walls.  you can put it between walls or a doorway or whatever & it stays tight so dogs can't get through.  it's also a nice height."
"my little ones favorite book! some of the word associations are abstract, but he live it because it has mickey mouse. it is helping him recognize letters"
great product for child or dog.
"i bought this for my precious granddaughter. she presently has a heavy winter blanket, and since spring and summer are around the corner, i thought this would be perfect for her. i haven't been to visit yet, her family lives eight hours away from me :(<br />this lovie is very nice quality, very soft and well made. i will update after i see her in june, i hope she loves it!"
perfect for newborn pictures. very soft. as pictured.
"very cute, fits my 5 month old"
"this product is awesome, work like a charm and every parent should own one."
good thick sturdy fabric i use this wet bag for weekend trips with one babe. fits about 15 diapers and maintains its shape standing up. i would recommend kanga care wet bags and their rumparooz diaper covers.
"works perfectly, love the color."
pairs perfectly with the wonder mat to create the perfect play space for your little b ones.
awesome bag .. the way it's made the print the pockets the two zip pockets very roomy inside magnetic closures are very strong very pleased with that ..... it's a great looking bag i'm using it this week to take on my trip to the uk as my purse it just doesn't have to be a diaper bag it can be your momma bag it looks that stylish<br />lovin it !!!!!!
Perfect toddler size pillow! I love the natural filler and cover of this pillow and appreciate the chemical-free design as well. I love how it can be washed and will not bunch up. I highly recommend this toddler pillow.
LOVE!LOVE!LOVE! Have I mentioned that I love this product? My LO absolutely adores these pacifiers. IT is so cute and very soft. Easy for little fingers to hold on to making it less likely to fly on the floor. Highly recommend!! Must have product!!
"These seem to be the best size and shape preference for my little girl. Every other pacifier we tried, she would dismiss. I recommend the glow in the dark ones for bedtime. Lifesaver."
Texas babies love the Browns too!!!
I love this product as my two older boys used it when they were babies. Now having the 3rd son I needed for my son. its soothing pacifier and I love it how it doesn't hurt the baby's mouth..
"this is the best footmuff/bunting we have tried for our children. it has been warm enough during 20 f weather (kids in coats, and hats as well), but has also been great in mild 50-60 f weather. it blocks the wind, and sheds water, and it zips up each side so that the child's torso can also be protected. we also love the small zipper pocket on the bottom for storing mittens or pacifier, or tissues, etc. this is super easy to wash as well!"
my son absolutely loves this!  it not only arrived on time but was a great price too!
"great quality sheets at a bargain price! fast shipping, good packaging, trusted seller. will buy again!"
excellent mattress and quick delivery...mattress is the perfect size for a mini crib and would suggest to anyone.
my 2 year old loves her pillow! she gets excited every night to lay on &#34;my pillow and get tuck tucked in&#34;. perfect size and great quality!<br /><br />thanks for a great product!
great product
love it!! so easy to install.
i love this product. they are very absorbent and they don't hold stains.
such a pretty wet bag and it works very well!
"shipped quickly, good quality mattress!"
great product
"these work great! no parts to take apart for , and no leaking."
this product is truly the easiest children's product i have ever used.  it always sets up with no complications and works perfectly!  i love it because it is so simple and the children love it.
these are so adorable and exactly what i was hoping for.
Awesome so easy and it looks great.
This has been great for our diaper bag! It fits 2 avent pacifiers and keeps them clean. I like that it is separate from other things in the bag!
Super cute!
Perfect gift.
Best pacifiers I bought thus far. The can hold on to it at only 2 months old and she seems to only like these from all of the ones I purchased.
:)
"My son loves it, however I do think its over priced but over all its great"
Cute and perfect easily fits two pacifier
Love them
I love it and loves it
My daughter has lost so many binkies especially at night. Got these thinking glow in the dark wonder how she will like them. Well they are perfect! It's the only nipple she likes out of every brand and at night when she spits it out I can find it super easy instead of searching in te dark half asleep and waking her up more.
My friend will get a kick out of this lol!!! LOVE it!!
Great Item
These are so nice in the middle of the night when its dark and you cant find the paci!!!
"He is super cute. His legs aren't quite as heavy as some of the wubbanubs to keep him in place, but the shape of his legs kind of make up for that."
"Absolutely our favorite pacifiers. Have you seen the pacifiers that have rubber wraps to the handle? Yeah, try cleaning those and they will become water logged...which leads to mold. These prevent that as it is all one piece basically. They work with Paci clips really well (both the ones made for these by the same company and even generic or diy paci clips like on etsy.) ...actually I like the diy ones better as they loop around and cannot be yanked out by the babe.  if registering for these, I would put at least 6 pairs on it. Cheap great add on item for guests to buy you and you really will need them all when you realize how easily they are lost."
so cute and perfect
"If you're baby will take a mam pacifier, these are a must have!!!! It makes it super easy to find and replace the pacifier without turning any lights on when the baby spits it half way across the room in the middle of night! Attach a &#34;blanket&#34; or a stuff animal to anchor it, you're golden."
my son loves this pacifier. I like because it is easy to clean. some other pacifier are very hard to clean or impossible to clean when
My baby's theme is giraffe and I am sooo in love with this! I want to buy more just because they are so cute and tiny for little babies!
Bought It for my Godson! The family love it! Had some great laughs and pictures!
i have been using this model since i got it at the hospital. i just love it
"These are the ONLY pacifiers my daugter will take. The glow in the dark kind is very convenient. They start to wear out a little after about 2 months, but they are definitely worth it and we will continue to buy."
These are the only pacifiers our son would use. Plus they were easy to find at night in the dark
They really glow even months after purchase! We keep these in the crib to make night time passy searching a breeze.
Great toy for my grandson
These are awesome!
TOO CUTE!!!!
Best pacifiers ever!
Great paci! my son absolutely loves it!
"I guess it's hard to review pacifiers, as reviewers tend to focus on whether or not their child liked the pacifier when giving stars. I give the MAM pacifiers 5 stars unequivocally, regardless of whether my baby liked them or not, because they are well made with a child's oral health in mind. My toddler has been using MAM pacifiers since she was 3 months old. We tried every pacifier on the market and she could not keep the pacis in her mouth at that age. The MAM worked from the start and we haven't looked back. They tend to be more expensive (per piece) than other pacifiers but I guess price isn't an issue if your baby likes this paci!"
"My baby loves these pacifiers but I love the glow in the dark ones. Charge quickly,  charge lasts a long time and makes the pacifier easy to find in crib or bassinet at night."
"Just had twin grandchildren and grandmothers have to keep things like this around.  Not much I can say about pacifiers.  I considered trying one out but my wife vetoed the idea.  They do look like excellent quality and were delivered quite rapidly.  Great that they come in multiple colors so grandmother can remember which infant uses which pacifier.  Let's be honest here, she'll still get them mixed up."
Love it
Love the MAM!
"Can't wait for my twins to use these, haven't received them yet..but I'm sure I'll love them, I ordered the monkey and giraffe.<br />Absolutely LuV them..life savers..my babies hug them and wrestle with them..so cute. Definitely gonna order more."
Really cute novelty!  Love it!
"My son was born 5 weeks early and spent a little over 3 weeks in the NICU anf the nurse recommended getting him one of these. It is awesome! It's easier to find in the dark, he can grab it. My favorite part is you can turn it upside down and wedge it between the bassinet so it won't fall out of his mouth as easy, or tuck it in his swaddle!!"
"My baby loves this soother and it's great when he's fussy or in between feedings. I got this kind because it was recommended to me by other moms and I was told it's the kind that they use at hospitals. Although I waited to use the soother until about 5 weeks because I was worried about interfering with breastfeeding, it hasn't been an issue at all and it use it now multiple times a day and it sometimes even works to put my baby to sleep. I'd definitely recommend."
"Got this pacifier today, hoped my 4 month baby will take it, but he wont((( tried different kinds of pacis, they don't work for us( like this paci for its shape and meterial, very good quality"
My LO can NOT be with out this wubba. I highly suggest this product to all moms.
"We absolutely love WubbaNubs! The elephant is no exception. It's the perfect size for my little guys hands and he loves it as a lovey, chew toy, and binkie :"
Great product got here fast
"These pacifiers are great, rated well by physicians. They have not caused us any problems with nipple confusion. Our baby has been a sucker soother since day one, so these help us in between feedings and help our baby to fall asleep.  They also have holes in the ring around the pacifier in case a larger child swallows it accidentally, it will not block their airway.  This is a common occurrence in the ER with young children.  Made of good quality and have not worn with heavy daily use and hand washing."
"I love these WubbaNubs!!!. Hard to loose and easy to clean! You don't have to put your fingers/hands on the actual pacifier every time you pick it up. Let the little monkey's body handle that part. They are nice and soft as pacifiers, but also great for teething; and not to mention a little &#34;buddy&#34; that has been there right from the very beginning of life. We raised 4 kids and I don't know how many pacifiers we lost and had to run out and buy past midnight. What a lifesaver!  You don't even have to clip it onto the baby's clothing. Those clips are nice, but surely get lost in the laundry!  Wish I had thought of this a long time ago!  For 5 months we began with 2  WubbaNubs and remain with the same 2 !  My biggest problem is which one do you choose??!  So precious!  Highly recommend this product!"
Love these pacifiers!
Love it and the concept of these pacifiers.  My grandson loves his dog so this was a cute idea for a pacifier.
the wubbanubs are amazing! they truly calm your child and give them something soft for comfort other than just a binky.
"wow, these are heaven on sore nipples! i also just used to help clear a milk bleb and they worked great!"
the wristbands were on time. they will work fine.
"each of my kids has this hamper in their room. it's the right size if you do laundy once a week. it's easy to carry to the laundry room, the perfect size, and can be left out in the open."
medela products are great quality. easy to clean and the medium flow is perfect for a little older baby. i like that i never had to use another flow after the slow flow. they really hold up well and i will be saving them for the next baby. no cracks or tears
so soft and well made. it looks just like the picture and it's actually bigger then the one he had before. i will definitely be buying one for his sister!
i ordered this for my grandsons birthday and i had days to spare. it made it on time. the set is great because of the sippy cup. i haven't found a set with all the needed pieces.
perfect fit. loved it
great mattress protector. it has washed well and seems to be really well made. i will be buying again.
it was easy to follow instructions and put on the wall
wonderful purchase
my  16 month baby walks around the house for half an hour every morning and night &#34;brushing his teeth&#34; seems to feel good on his sore gums and he must like the taste of the tooth gel. i will definitely buy again when it runs out.
love this brand
what an excellent unit for the price. clear picture in low light situations and you can easily switch between camera and talk to your baby through it if you want. highly recommended.
"this wrap has been a life saver. i read the step by step instructions the first time i put it on and have not had to read them again, it's pretty easy to put on and take off. i have been using this since my baby was a week old- i was the dishes and use it when he's fussy and needs to be close to his mama. it comes with a little cloth storage bag, but i just roll up the wrap and store it in our hall closet."
"This looks amazing over the jaipuri quilt and shams, very rich looking...everyone says wow when they come into our daughter's room!"
Such a great idea for a new baby.
Great product and great price for add-on purchase. Arrived qyickly too.
The baby loved this pacifier.  Plus it was fun because he got a lot of double takes and laughs with it.  It was very unexpected to see a happy baby- with a mustache.
"My baby loves these. She chews on the sides when teething. Also, she didn't have any issue going to the new size. I just wish i could know when ordering exactly what the colors would be, Instead of yellow, mine came with green edges. I don't mind though. I also liked the fact that these are different than ones sold in the stores. There were several babies born in our church this year and alot of them had the same newborn paci's."
this is a great baby calendar. it has premade stickers to place on the calendar when appropriate.  this is a must have to keep track of your baby's accomplishments.
love it
"i love this monitor! my husband and i did a lot of research before finally deciding on this monitor. it was exactly what we were looking for. i was planning on having to spend a lot more on monitor, but this one works great for the low price. definitely will recommend it to my friends having kids."
it is nice that the main lid screws on &#34;backwards&#34; so you (or little fingers) don't unscrew the main lid when undoing the little orange one.  it is also nice that these are dishwasher safe - in my house it needs to be dishwasher safe it would like to survive.  my 2 1/2 year old still uses them and i used it to put pizza sauce in when i made homemade 'pizza lunchables'.
baby's favorite!
good design with the little cap. easy to take when going out.
"elegant and classy! this is a very sturdy, beautiful frame! the god parents loved it!"
very soft and cuddly. our grandson loves it!
good quick sale. the bottles that arrived didn't match the ones in the pic which i didn't expect but turned out happier anyway as i got the bottles i originally wanted.
love this lampshade for my girl's nursery - goes perfectly with the lolli living owl base.
best purchase- well worth the money- my baby loves it
"my two and a half year old son loves these. they stick to the tub and wall tiles easily. also, the bag is very convenient for storage."
"great, fast shipping"
very good
it is a good car seat and my son loves it!!!!
very good
beautiful baby blanket!! so soft and would recommend it for any shower gift!
"look very nice, good product"
"i love this halo sleepsack, my baby is 2 months old and we have used it frequently because he does not like to have his arms swaddled but stays warm in this fleece."
great job! timely manner
"it's a big friggin hook for holding stuff on the stroller among other uses. i will say, however, that it is overpriced (harbor freight has some non-branded ones for $1.99) but worth the cost of not having to drive to the store."
i love this seat! it takes up way less space than a highchair and is conveniently portable. my 6 month old loves to be able to sit at the table with her big brother and sister; it makes her feel like one of them. it's easy to clean too! i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a space-saving seat that can be taken out and about.
perfect. thanks
"double as a foot rest for the full laid back kid lifestyle. perfect for the toddlers that like to have their snack and bottle accessible during the stroll around town... come on bob, we have talked about that, this should be included with a purchase of a bob stroller."
great toy
these maymom pump valves came quickly. they are the same as the ones used for avent's original breast pump only better. these seen to be made of a heavier more durable material. i am hoping they will last longer.
perfect!
"bought this as an extra changing table to put in our bedroom for our newborn. easy to put together & works great! it came with a flat changing pad, but i bought one of the thicker curved ones instead. i have no complaints about this changing table!"
"i never write a review. but i live in a small house and needed more seating. everyone that sits in this chair loves it. it is so comfortable. it arrived in one piece, no assembly required. it is a heavy chair due to the rocker/swivel mechanism.  i bought the brown chair and when my 3 year old granddaughter eats snacks in it, i just wipe it off with a damp cloth and so far so good. the only thing missing is a comfy foot stool at a reasonable price."
"easy to install and very sturdy, my daughter did however figure it out quickly and ended up pinching her arm badly i. the parts of the gate that slide together."
super quick to ship and this works great i love 4moms!
"love this. very durable and good material, easy to put together. my son loves it."
"it is super easy to add on to my existing gate, just a quick snap in. now, the original gathering strap is no longer functional due to the larger size, but that is the only negative i can see. the 2 extra panels makes a huge difference!"
love it!!  a lil small but worth it for me. fast delivery n like how it has four lil silver things on the bottom so the bag will stand up instead of falling over. has pockets inside as well as the outside
good
these are a perfect match for our rockets tula. they are well made and a great size.
nice!
love it looks just as good in the babys room as on the picture
bought this for a christmas gift for my new grandson i hope he likes it.......will get back after he opens it
works great on my car windows so far. i just stuck it on and then smoothed it out with a credit card.<br />i like that i don't have to worry about it being dangerous.
great product for the price
my son loves this.it's a really good teething ring and easy for him to you. the seller was a hundred percent accurate with description and fast with delivery
exactly what i was expected nice and big
"all i can say had a message from Calofornia saying my grandson loved it ,so thats good enough for me"
Great product
"While my daughter only used this product for a month before she gave up on pacis all together, this was a seriously beloved item in our home. She was so cute with this in her mouth as she would learn to touch/grab the giraffe. She was about 5-7 months when she had this- so it was very helpful in development in my opinion. I am unsure of their sizing though. It seemed as if it wasn't going to last very long with the nipple sizing and I couldn't find the next size up in the soothie. So, I was glad she just dropped the whole paci idea."
"Awesome gift.  Super cute and babies love to teeth on the frog's feet.  It's a cute plush, an awesome pacie and a teether.  It's 3 gifts in one."
"We love these pacifiers, and more importantly, our little one loves these pacifiers. They are the only ones he will not spit out. I love the bright colors, too, as they are easy to find. My only complaint would be that the colors vary so you can't pick which you want. We have lucked out on colors each time, between gender neutral and boy colors, not that a pink pacifier is the end of the world!"
Great game super fast shipping I'm very satisfied.
A good pacifier for my grandson.  He loves it
"This pacifier is a life saver. My daughter, at 2 months old, is on a medication that tastes horrible. I would fight her ever time I had to give it and she would spit most of it out. Now that I have this awesome pacifier she takes every drop without any fussing or fighting. I would recommend this to anyone with little ones, truly is a life saver!!!"
Super cute!
My son loves this. Esp. great for the car seat.
Item was exactly as it appears and as described.  Shipped quickly!
"MAM pacifiers are the only brand my daughter likes. These are super cute, the crystal plastic is a nice change, and if course, they are typical, high-quality MAM pacies."
Great product!!!!  No complaints at all
My son uses it but it is a tad heavy for him at this time. I am sure he will use it more as he gets bigger.
So cute... I know he'll love it... and it was well packaged... It came on time for the baby shower...
Great
Prompt service and very happy with the quality
I like it because it cannot get lost as easily as a single pacifier. However I thought it might be a little heavier so baby couldn't spit it out quite so easily. All in all it is good. My baby is only 2.5 months old so he isn't quite holding onto things and realizing what he's doing yet.
Cute
Wife loved it
great box for pacifier. It keeps pacifier clean and easy to carry around.
"I have tried several pacifiers and these by far are the best of the lot (at least, they're the only ones my baby want). My son practically grew up to toddlerhood with these. It got him through his circumcision, his regular bouts of croup, his vaccine ordeals and his frightening visits to the pediatrician's clinic. When nothing else works, these rubber lifesavers are the only answer to his explosive tantrums. Without these, I would lose my sanity while treading the torturous path of parenthood."
it did not work LOL
my son love this pacifier it was great
great product!!!
"I love WubbaNub.  They have been my son's best friends, and therefore, mine."
Bigger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise...super cute...I keep all &#34;wet&#34; items such as my baby butt cream and my hand lotion and chap stick in here...basically anything I don't want to ruin my actual diaper bag if it were to open or leak.  It's adorable and made very well!
great product!!!
"Showed up early, using as a replacement for kid. Very happy with product and seller."
"These are seriously the best invention for holding a soothie! We used these with our last child and are now using these with our newest addition. We rarely loose the binky. They are nice and soft, easy to clean. We throw ours in the wash with all the other baby clothes and rinse the soothie part after to remove any film the detergentay have left. For those parents who choose to give their child a pacifier this is a must have"
My daughter likes these pacifiers. I like that they are one piece and soft.
"Great, at first my lil boy didn't pay much attention to it, but now it's his favorite paci, he holds the toy and hugs it to sleep, so sweet!<br />The only issue is that I cannot sterilize it as other pacifiers, I have to boil water and hold it some time in it, but it worth it! ;)"
Great deal
This is the best invention of the 21st Century: glow in the dark pacifiers. No more looking everywhere in the crib for it at 2am. I can see it from across the room. Such a smart idea!
great product!!!
Perfect
Buy as many as you can get. These are GENIUS. Keeps the Soothie from rolling away or getting lost in the diaper bag. Also makes it a lot more fun for baby - he quickly learned how to hold and retrieve his own soothie without having to use clips or anything. LOVE these so much.
great durable
So cute!! A little bit difficult with the newborn to keep it in their mouth but with a little bit older baby it's perfect!
"My 13 month old son only uses binkies at nap time and night, but has always needed two. To fall asleep, he likes one in his mouth and one in his hand. MAM is the only brand he will use, and I love how cute these are! The glow in the dark makes it easier for him to find if he moves around and loses track of the one in his hand."
Works good for Avent soothie pacifiers and NUKs.
Love this product. We especially love using this while our baby is in the car seat because the weight of stuffed animal keeps the pacifier in place.
"Saw this on SharkTank, bought it for my sister who is expecting. I was impressed with the quality, it far exceeded my expectations!  The movement of the cords up and down is so smooth it doesn't even make a sound. I love that it fits all types of pacifiers so you're not stuck buying only their pacifiers. I wish I had another baby just so I could buy one for myself!!"
Perfect size for diaper bag
Very Good Item and Good price..
Great product!
"Love this! It's very soft with beanbag-like feet that make it easy to prop up next to a sleepy, fussy baby. Even though my almost 4 month old has started using the soothie part less often, she still likes to cling to the frog and cuddle it in her sleep. It's easy to wash and dry. We take it everywhere we go!"
Very cute little puppy!
good
Love these..used them for a green bay packer diaper cake..turned out great..
"How did parents do it with only pacifiers in the old days?! This is awesome I ended up buying 2 because my son loves it so much. Meow, we named the kitten, is not heavy but just heavy enough that he won't be throwing the pacifier all over for us to chase. He loves it and that makes us happy"
Perfect for a gift
"These are very similar to the kind given to our son in the hospital. He prefers this kind, and I love that since it's all one piece I don't have to worry about a choking risk from the base coming detached. They don't say on them the age range they should be used for though, so make sure you have them all gathered up before adding newer ones"
Got this as a &#34;congrats&#34; gift when I first heard my friend was having a baby. Came in a timely manner and they loved it.
very useful. but a little pricey.
baby loved it
The only pacifiers I would give my baby!!!! Love them. Definitely soothing.
My baby loves his Wubbanub's!! I love that they use the soothir like pacifier and the weighted toy makes it easy for baby to hold on to.  It helps bink stay in close position to baby's mouth and helps keep it from hitting the floor most of the time. They are also a great toy for baby to play with. Plus they look super cute when baby is sucking on them. My little guy pets his while falling asleep and it is the cutest thing ever! These make the best gifts as well because you can never have too many Wubbanub's!
Both of my grandkids have used these.  LOVE THEM so much I ordered these for my granddaughter who is expected to be here in May.
My twin greatfrandbaby that lives in North Carolina mama says she loves this very much
great product nt have to worry about the later if the teeth will be pushed out.. great product..
Our daughter loves this more as a little stuffed animal than for the pacifier.  But it's cute!
Cute but comes in a bag
"We love our Wubbanub! Our twins are 4 months old and they love to grip onto their stuffed animal while sucking on their paci.  Also, we seem to not loose it nearly as often, then when their pacifier is alone. The animal is super cute and the perfect size for their little hands."
My 5 month old loves her elephant WubbaNub.  She puts every part of that elephant in her mouth....though she won't take the pacifier.
"Great, lve that the glow in dark."
best pacifiers!
Perfect for sleeping. No hard plastic.
good
These glow nicely all night making them easy to find. I like that they also come with a box for storage and sterilization.
My daughter loves it. My husband loves it. It looks so cute!
good
Adorable. as advertised. Great for baby shower
"Planning on bringing my new grandson South for a visit some time, so I wanted him to fit in from the word go. Dressed in a pair of bib overalls, and Billy Bob buck teeth will get the silver spoon spoiled in the womb little rascal over the Mason Dixon minus pretense. A Walmart gift card will accesorize him with the necessary fishin pole, and BB gun, for a good ole frog catchin expedition at Grandpa's place on Lil Dogwood ;^)"
these will work great for my little one and they wasn't late
"does exactly what it says, glows in the dark"
"Some newborns are picky. Mine was one of those newborns. We tried pacifier after pacifier and this was the only one she would take. So we stuck with it!<br /><br />They seem safe enough to use regularly. She pretty much only uses them when she falls asleep, but we've never felt uncomfortable with her using them. The colors are bright and fun, and the clear plastic is simple and modern.<br /><br />A word of advice-- as your baby gets older, keep an eye on how they play with their pacifier. At about four months my baby could fit a lot of this pacifier into her mouth, which freaked me out. Don't forget to move up to the next size (they make 3-6 and 6+) when it's time!"
Baby's favorite type of pacifier
Our son's new favorite Mam! He's always loved Mam pacifiers but he reaches for this one the most.
Who doesn't love a WubbaNub?  THIS TOY IS SO FUN. Thank you.
Good came fast
i gave this as a baby shower gift and everyone absolutely loved. right now is handy for the baby for the pacifier and then when the baby gets old can remove the pacifier and they have an awesome toy to play with. the parents loved it  because it makes it easier to find while in the car.
Absolutely adore these. Perfect for any baby
"As does my grandson, an avid Clemson fan although he is unaware of this fact yet!!"
Thanks
Good
I bought this for my first great-granddaughter and she loves it!  It is really easy to keep track of a pacifier when it is attached to a giraffe.  I bought the giraffe because it is my granddaughter's favorite animal.
Great product and price. These were the only ones my son would take.
I don't know why these didn't exist sooner!  They are perfect in the middle of the night when so you don't have to fish around for passy in the crib in the dark!
Great price
Great
Thank you so much I love it! Was as described and shipping and excellent.
baby loves it! Best Pacifier to date.... and I have tried a lot!
These were awesome.  Gave them to my Niece as a fun item to use on her new child.  Lots of fun and laughs and reasonably priced.
"The Wubbanub is a wonderful pacifier!  Easy to hold, find and clean."
great light blanket for spring or fall
these are great bibs! i love all the patterns. my daughter is always drooling and was always wet. these bibs are so so soft and they keep her totally dry.it is great that they have 2 snaps so i can adjust the bib as she gets older. excellent quality excellent product.
holds all my stuff in  great looking case. small enough to fit in a purse.
"great transition diaper between newborn and one size snap downs. in my opinion the one size diapers tend to bunch up a lot, especially between the legs leaving your baby all wierdly shaped and bulky. this one is much narrower in the crotch area. you can perhaps get away by putting this on a chunky newborn 8lb+. but certainly won't fit you right out of the hospital. the quality is good.<br /><br />buy it elsewhere for $6/$7."
"best thing to happen to my sleep haha i am a very light sleeper and almost every noise will wake me up... which is very frustrating. after getting this and having it run all night, i find that i am calmer and fall asleep faster and stay asleep because it drowns out all other noises. i know this is for a baby, but it definitely works for me (an adult)! it has other sounds it can emit too but i just use it for the white noise. would definitely recommend this to anyone needed help sleeping."
these are great!  they are large enough to cover the whole back side of a nissan titan front seat.  great service.
this is a great product and arrived super fast! i would recommend for anyone with a teething little one!
Great ty
I've always loved MAMs but the glow in the dark are so great at night to help find them.
"This thing has been a lifesaver! It holds 2 pacifiers, and 1 pacifier clip. Or it can hold 3 pacifiers without any clips. I use the Nuk pacifiers. It will only really hold 2 smoothies at a time"
Thankfully we got the color we wanted. :) my son loves these pacifiers since they are symmetrical. Not sold in a lot of stores so glad to find them here
great product
Exactly what I thought it would be. An easier more productive way to take care of your little one
My new great grandson is only 1 month old. So not quite ready for it.  But his mommy loves the idea of it & can't wait to use it
"Baby isn't here yet, so haven't used it yet but it is super cute! Can't wait to use it. Appears to be good quality. Still need to boil it before use tho. Exactly what I was looking for!"
My baby absolutely loves this. We leave this as her pacifier in her crib and its almost like a security blanket for her. She can hold on to it and feels comfortable. It also helps to keep it in her mouth so you dont have to play the pacifier game until she falls asleep.
"I get such a kick out of watching my 'Lil Guy when he uses this. Very well made, sturdy. Good item."
I LOVE MAM PRODUCTS
very good
bought this for my daughter & her 1st child. super cute idea ~ seems easier to keep up with than a baby book. good purchase!
love this thing!  it fits just about everything and i can throw it in the wash as-is.  i can usually get the belt to wrap around something to keep her secured as well.
"cute and lightweight. my son really likes wearing this. he has only worn it a few times but so far, it has held up well."
"keep our baby dry, they're absorbant and the velcro is much better then the cheaper bibs. looks cute too."
nice looking and very good quality.
"these are my favorite bibs for the &#34;drooly months.&#34; no velcro to mess with your other laundry or irritate baby's skin. ten of them seemed like a lot at first, but then there's always a clean one handy."
so so soft. the baby loves it. he is 5 mo old and it is one of his favorite things . he holds it next to his cheek and dozes off.<br />definately 5 stars.
my son really likes the pillow and seem pretty comfortable.
given as gift to niece.  seemed to like it. a great idea for the teething little ones!
looks really nice . can't wait to use it for my babies smash cake
exactly what i wanted! now i can't wait until my grandson gets here to see him using it! it's super super adorable!
"i'm so happy to have found this bottle/sippy cup for my baby! i wanted to stay away from plastic bottles and this was the answer. very well made and sturdy. also well thought out with there being no plastic parts, even when adding in the optional straw pura offers. very happy!!"
"our two and a half month baby absolutely loves this. she will lay in her crib for a long time just staring at it. love that it has a light and so many different options of what to listen to, including a heartbeat!"
"these pouches are really great! we love them so much i just bought a second package. we have put all kinds of stuff in there, from homemade veggie and fruit purees to yogurt mixed with fruit to applesauce. all different textures do great in these--my daughter has no issues getting out even the thicker ones! all the things we used to feed her with a spoon we can now put in these pouches, making eating on the go, and at daycare, and feeding the baby when we're trying to cook dinner and eat too so much easier since she can do it herself. we have been using them for about a month and so far have not had any instances of the pouches opening when they shouldn't. they can go in the dishwasher, but we found we prefer to wash them by hand with the bottle brush. in the very bottom of the pouch where the bottom meets the sides, there is often food stuck in there that doesn't come out in the dishwasher (we just use the small brush part of our bottle brush to clean that part out without issue). also dirty water from the dishwasher cycle tends to collect in the outside of the pouch when we stand it upside down in the top rack--yuck! we send these to daycare, and since a few other moms have bought them after seeing how much we like ours, labeling is a must, but i have found that the sharpie washes off the name tag on the back. i solved that by putting a small piece of transparent tape over her name. i also really like the color and design--very thankful that they are not in cutesy shapes. also--do yourself a favor and when buying these (or for that matter, any refillable pouch) buy the funnel pitcher too. chunkier purees go in much cleaner and easier when using the pitcher. not necessary, but for less than $5, you'll be glad you did. this is a great product! buy some for yourself!"
i absolutely love it n so does my 4month old daughter faith
great product! my daughter loves them for her yogurt.
"great addition to our bedding set!  love how it ties neatly at the end of the crib for easy access.  out of the way, but still a nice accent to add to the room's dcor."
we have been using charlie banana cloth for a while but i was gifted some disposable liners (no idea the brand) and just recently ran out so i ordered these. we love them. first of all because they fit the diaper perfectly. my last liners were too big and i had to fold them. the charlie banana liners are so so soft! they catch all the poo and we flush them and have had no problem with them clogging the toilet. i will continue to use these as long as we cloth diaper.
my son is three and i've been looking around for a toddler pillow. this comes with a pillow and pillow case great for a starter bed set. the pillow is very comfortable yet firm.
"i really like that there are no suction cups on this shade. it is really easy to move around and seems to diffuse sunlight very well. you can see through the shades, but of course it is not like looking through window glass. i would recommend them!"
mirror is great! it is huge which means a lot easier to see you little one. super adjustable and sturdy. beats all other mirrors we have had!
love this piggy bank! just what i was looking for!
It was perfect for the bassinet. Nice quality.  Tracer
"GREAT PRODUCT! As described. Sturdy, easy to clean, and natural! Our daughter loves it."
So cute!
Perfect baby shower gift!
"The kid loves these pacifiers!  We've tried other kinds, but he only wants these."
These are my favorite brand of nuks.
My little one had a hard time with the Avent nipples when he was first born. This fit more easily into his little mouth and helped with the gas he was getting from improper suction. A lot of people think the construction is overly complicated but there aren't any more parts than in an Avent bottle. I love these bottles and wish I had found them for my first baby.
Great product. My baby loves it. Super fast delivery.
Babies love this one
Best binkies ever. I even bought the pink for my son who uses them when sleeping because I couldn't find the blue. I wish they weren't discontinued. The only binkies my son will use.
I love these! I can fit two of the gumdrop pacifiers in them and the other brand of rubber pacifiers.
I Love it
Really cute
Only pacifier our baby will take. These wonderful silicone/rubber blobs had saved us many sleepless nights.
Great product!
Love it
I have foster babes and they all love this brand. Our children's hospital uses it. Buying the six pack means I can always find one when I need to (well usually).
He liked it for a bit until he quit the paci on his own around 4 mo. old.
These pacifiers are great. ..every new mother i have given them to loves them.
Was very pleased with the product and the service I recieved!
"very good, just love it"
"I adore these wubbanubs. My daughter has had the lamb since she was born and it's gotten a little ragged. I wanted to order another one because I pull my hair out trying to find it when it's lost. I loved the colors of this one and the ease of holding it since it's shape. It doesn't seem as soft as the lamby, but it's adorable and I am glad we had another to add to our collection."
cute and very durable
Fast shipping product was new and my son loves his monkey!
Cute pacifier! Goes great with baby cowboy hat and bib also sold on Amazon. Nice shower gift.
Love these the best yet. Shipped and delivered on time.
"very good, just love it"
exactly as described.
"I like that they make a clicking sound from the handle hitting the shield when they drop, so you can somewhat tell where they go in the middle of the dark night ;) hha."
Item just as described.  Just what I was looking for.  Great doing business with.  Thanks !!  A+++++
My daughter loves them! Very easy to clean.
Item just as described.  Just what I was looking for.  Great doing business with.  Thanks !!!  A+++++
My go-to gift whenever anyone has a baby - every item I'm bought from the Wubbanub collection is adorable.
Best pacifier ever.. love that the product has bottles as while
Both of my children love their WubbaNubs. The plush animal makes it easy for babies to find the pacifier at night saving mom from running into the nursery all night when they wake up. They last forever...even my toddler's tug-of-war couldn't rip the pacifier from the plush. Just throw it in the washing machine for easy cleaning!
my 2 month old grabbed it which is a good sign.
Cute
Funny!
Just a cool pasifier everybody gets a laugh
Great quality. Teat is shaped like a MAM pacifier.
My babies love these. Had them from the hospital as well.
Great pacifier holder. Cute useful and protective
Perfect!  Son loves them.
Shop for my friends. She told me that her baby loves this. I think the baby likes it which shows the product is a good one.
"Very chic, not bulky whatsoever, enough space for two mam pacifiers"
"Glow in the dark passies.....totally, completely brilliant!"
These are my favorite pacifiers. The best.
"These little guys are the best. My babies loved them and the animal is not only cute, but useful as it lets smaller babies hold the pacifier in place long before they would be able to with a regular pacifier."
Ok
Great product
Ok
my daughter was thrilled and surprised by this. as a early childhood educator she loves this product.
"I gave these a five star because they are good quality and I wanted them to work, but my son wouldn't have it. He is ebf and only takes the MAM pacifiers."
Very nice items for a little cowboy!!
My bby loved it..
"I bought this one for my second child because my daugther loved it. It's easy to grab, & I don't have to worry about loosing pacifiers,  it's easy to find if misplaced, definitely a product I would recommend or gift."
Got these for my granddaughter who spends time here and is sometimes without her paci ... arrived right on time and she loves them!
"Great size for my little 14mo baby, flat little plastic thing to suck on, good size, she popped it in her mouth right away and had no cares in the world :)"
EXCELLENT
fine
"Critical to have on hand for a newborn!  Do not leave home without one.  Our baby was not a huge pacifier kid, but these are still amazing when they need to be soothed.  This is typically what the hospital gives you too!"
My baby liked these the best.
"I'm not sure how I got by without these.  Consider this one slightly smaller and lighter than the 4 legged ones available.  My son went for this turtle first when he was 8 months due to the smaller, compact size."
I used them to replace the pacifier on my son's Wubbanub. Worked great! Just used a thimble and it was easy enough to poke holes to see through.
Love these pacifiers! The colors are very cute.
This cute lil zebra arrived in just  5 days!  My new grandson is going to love it.
We absolutely loved them.
excellent
Great quality and super fast shipping. I'll be back!!!
My son doesnt use them much but they are nice when he does
excellent
very comforting for a little one.
"Great quality, easy to wash. I'm obsessed with Wubbanubs and would purchase one of each if my husband would allow it."
Baby loved it. Says it all.
Super fast shipping great product.  Excellent seller I needed this for a baby shower and the seller got it to me super fast!  Would definitely recommend and buy again.  Thank you!
Best pacifier out there
Everyone at our party enjoyed this game :-)
Mam pacifiers are the only ones our baby will take and the glow in the dark makes it much easier to find when he drops it in the middle of the night!
Great idea for a pacifier .... Keeps it from falling  and a soft animal for baby to hold
My baby loved it! Helped her to hold it in her mouth better and she loves holding it and cuddling it.
Perfect for the diaper bag!  The small pacifier wet bag is great for silverware too.
Cute toy but my baby prefers other pacifier instead
LOVE THESE!  Can easily be sanitized without the nasty seems that other brands have.  The quality is fantastic!  I own about 20 of these...one for just about everywhere!
We bought these cause they were recommended since we were breastfeeding but my daughter ended up never taking a pacifier. They really do glow in the dark which makes it easy to find them and they look like they would be great.
"Very handy, i like the idea that it's machine washable and it's in perfect condition even after multiple rounds in the dryer. My babies love them, we have already ordered three of these."
"Wubbanubs are just amazing. I mean, you should probably take out stock in the company."
Good!
So cute!
So fun!
Ok
Good
We had various reasons to use a pacifier very early on in my baby's life. We never had nipple confusion using this brand.
Such a cute Wubbanub! My baby LOVES it!
My baby LOVES LOVES LOVES his WubbaNub. I actually got two for him (frog and elephant). He enjoys being able to cuddle with the stuffed animal while soothing himself to sleep with the pacifier. BRILLIANT!!
NICE.
Ok
These are by far my granddaughters favorite. She can put them in either way and it doesn't matter. Highly recommend!!
Bought as a gift for a friend because my son loved his puppy wubbanub. Every picture I see of their little girl she is cuddling with the little zebra. It is super cute in person! I love that it's not the popular ones you see at the big baby stores.
"Love these pacifiers! So much easier to find when dropped than the normal Soothie and, at 4 months, my son is able to occasionally get it back in his mouth thanks to the arms and legs of the puppy. These wash up really well too."
"My 3 month old has loved this since she was 2 weeks old. She can hold its paws and keep it by her mouth, and it is easy for me to find at night if she drops it."
So sweet and stays in great.
Love these pacifiers! They have been a lifesaver for us since day 1 and after 4 months of use they are still going strong.
What is there to say? If you have a binky baby these do the trick for keeping them quiet and content! Love the product but hoping to break mine from the unnessasary sucking that she loves to do ALL day and night! Time for my babe to learn other coping skills. :)
Not bad.
Hilarious! Quite strong and durable. Extremely good for a giggle. Even funny when adults use them!
It was just what I wanted. The baby likes it better than others. I ordered more than one the company sent them separate. They should try to combine all purchases into one shipment
perfect
Works like a charm. very easy to use. highly recommended
Daughter-in-law loved it!
Love it.. The little bit of weight it has in the feet helps it to stay in my 2 month old's mouth.. I will be ordering another animal..
The plush animal helps keep the pacifier from rolling away once the baby has let go of it (or spit it out).  We find these to be one of the best baby purchases we have made.
Love it! Can out on diaper bag or throw in purse.
"This pacifier is worth it's weight in gold. It's genius!  The little giraffe helps to keep the pacifier close to my daughters mouth even if she spits it out, so she is able to put it back in instead of needing to cry for me.<br /><br />At night I put this on her tummy, and so when she wakes her pacifier is right there to help her back to sleep immediately!!<br /><br />A must have for any parent."
Great purchase 
We are always loosing these. Good value.
"great game for a baby shower, a lot of cards"
This is so wonderful! I love that it dries everything! Such a time saver! Plus it gives extra piece of mind knowing the bottles/pump parts/pacis are extra clean!
"excelent product, just as described, and shipping fast"
"I bought these for my 4 month old son. He has loved the original Soothie, so I wanted to try these, the &#34;Super Soothie&#34; as they call it. They are stiffer and the rubber base is a bit thicker. He really enjoys them. I think they feel more like a finger (which is his usual preference if he can grab someone's hand!) He likes to switch between the softer and harder ones depending on his mood. I just wish they made the WubbaNubs with the option of this one."
Good product
Our daughter loved this Paci
good
Great paci's.
good product
sturdy and lightweight- ideal for our visiting young onesi n our community clubhouse.
no leaks and a great price!
love it
i got a c.r. gibson baby memory book for one of my other kiddos and loved all the detail included. so i would definitely recommend!
"my 2 year old loves this thing, it is way bigger than i thought it would be which was a bonus!  it lights up different colors only when in water, still don't understand how that works, but it is cool!"
everyone loved them at my baby shower. very cute and fun:)
son's favorite!
great buy!
works great and my daughter loves her stool.
i buy these sheets to tie dye for my shop at happy yiayia tie dye on etsy. [...]
this is the only pacifier our granddaugher will take.<br />it's also adorable!
love the ties that secure it to the rails.  they are longer then other brands i've bought and are also a bit stretchy making it so easy to tie.
very cute
"this product is high quality, i was afraid it would be of a cheap material.  i highly recommend it, it was delivered faster than the estimated delivery."
"I just received this bumper, i loved.first i got scared with the size, because even if you know the mesure before buy you would be waiting for something smaller.anyway is very good thing, i personaly put the two pieces together under the shhetsto make it longer on the edge of my soon's bed, is so confortable, not hard,no smells,and keeps the sahpe even if you seat on top of, like i do sometimes to read to my soon.i use to have pillow under his sheets and still worry that he could fall of the bed, but now i can sleep with no worries, he is well protected and confortable...i think this could be covered with some kind of fabric to be over perfect.."
Best pacifier for my baby
The baby loves these and the travel case is a great addition to the diaper bag. Easy to clean and store.
"These are the only pacifiers my kids would/will take. They love them and I've tried several others and they refuse them. One thing I don't like is that I feel like junk gets caught in or around the actual pacifier part that goes in their mouth and that disgusts me. . . I try to keep it clean but it's just one more thing to remember and I wish it could be designed so that it wasn't so hard to clean. I worry about what gets inside it as I've seen water in there and have no way of getting it out. Otherwise, I love them because my kids love them. :)"
"Works great, and seems to be accurate"
"Even when it's not in his mouth he loves to hold onto it. We received the giraffe as a gift from my work, my son loved it so much that we had to buy another."
These are the only pacifiers that my 3 week old likes. They absolutely save the day when my daughter is being fussy. I absolutely love these pacifiers!
Great for baby to hold on to.
This are my son's favorite
Awesome! My baby loves this pacifier/lovey combo!
Never lose a nanny again!  Great product and my daughter loves it!
thanks
"My daughter loves hers!  Sometimes when she's not sucking on the pacifier she just plays with it.  Makes it easy for us to find her pacifier!!  I didn't think it was heavy enough to keep from falling out if she was moving her head a lot, but it was definitely better than the paci alone."
These are too cute and I can't wait to give them to my new grandbaby!
"These bottles are pretty great, IMO. I admit, there are a lot of parts to take apart and clean, but you get used to it like everything else. Mine have only leaked when I don't screw them properly. I have a 5 week old, fussy girl and these are great for her."
These are easy to find when your baby has spit it out in the middle of the night!
I LOVE THESE PACIFIERS ( OKAY MY BABY LOVES THEM ) SO MUCH WE HAVE BOUGHT THEM SINCE OUR BABY WAS A NEWBORN. WE HAVE USED ALL SIZES AND OUR SON STILL USES THEM. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!!
"My baby loves these! We tried several different pacifiers (Nuk, hospital freebie, and the one with the stuffed animal attached) when my daughter was born and she didn't take to any of them. I figured she was just one of those babies that don't like pacis and I was fine with that.  However, one of these came free with my Chicco carseat purchase. I thought nothing of it but offered it to her and she loved it.  She's 5 months old and has been using these since newborn. Love them."
Once you know which pacifiers your child likes then get them in bulk.  These have been through high abuse by our child and run through the dishwasher (top rack) many times.  They are easy for them to hold / pick up.<br /><br />If your child likes this style then these are great.  I would purchase again due to their high durability.
Glow in the dark pacifiers are the most wonderful invention of all time.
"best video baby monitor, in this price range. i am a mother to three boys ages 3,2, and newborn. i have owned 5 video monitors. 3 of them being summer infants that all broke in under a year. i was distraught over the amount of money i was spending and the hassle over returning monitors. i then switched things up and went with this monitor. i have this monitor, and three cameras. the transition in scanning room to room is brilliant for parents of multiple little kiddos. it keeps track of the kids temperatures in their rooms and also has an option to talk to your kids in the monitor. i just recently bought this monitor for the second time as a backup to our first one, and so we have one to set up at grandmas. this monitor is sturdy, reliable and easy to use. the only monitor you'll ever need."
"good quality, fits well and looks nice"
my children love it. it's long enough to fit my 2 and 3 year old when they want to brush their teeth and wash their hands together. it's light enough for my girls to move it from the toilet and back to the sink. i have no complaints.
the only one that fit and worked as designed. no spurts of pee pee outside the ring!
this is the third one i have bought (one for each kid) and it is my favorite model of the three.
"so comfy, easy to use, durable, nice and thick.these are so much better than  using a blanket."
love these
perfect for holding hair ribbons and small items
"i bought this to use to wash small toys in. it works perfectly to hold the toys in place, but still get them clean and sanitized!"
my 1yr old baby girl loves them!
i love this giraffe.  every child that i gift one to absolutely loves it.
"my mom bought me this wipes warmer because my newborn cried during diaper changes. i didn't get it out of the box or set it up for a month because: my baby stopped crying during changes, the thing is way wider than a regular box of wipes, and i really didn't think it was necessary. i finally set it up today, and i'm so glad i did. i don't know why i waited so long.<br />i can get through a diaper change without fully waking up my baby now! what a lifesaver!! until this morning, i was warming wipes in my hands or sticking them on my stomach. if you are like i was, and are thinking wipes warmers are a silly luxury, try sticking a wipe on your stomach at 4am. they're freaking cold!!<br />the wipes don't seem to heat uniformly, but they're still warm. and yes, they do lose some of the heat when you take them out of the container, but they're still warm enough to not shock your little baby's bum.<br />totally worth the extra space it takes up.<br /><br />oh, mine also came with a little plastic container filled with a roll of green baggies, and a refill of the baggies. there was no description of these anywhere, so i can only assume they're for the diaper bag to contain dirty diapers and wipes. but i could be totally wrong, that's just how i've decided to use them."
love them
this has been very comforting to us in trying to avoid an accident with our 1.5 year old.  we put this on our basement door to prevent her from getting access to the stairs.  will be purchasing more!
"bought this for my son's nursery, and i'm very happy with the purchase. the quality of the paper, and the print is very high. to install it, all i had to do was soak it for a few seconds in water, take it in the bedroom, and press it into place where i wanted it. i do recommend having a helper with this, because it made it made it much easier to put into place with help to support it's weight. after it was in place, i only had to wipe it over a few times with a wet rag to smooth out the bumps.<br /><br />though i've painted, hung drywall, and done alot of dyi projects over the years, this was my 1st time ever attempting wall border. it was really no problem at all, as long as you have a little bit of common sense. everyone who has come to my house and seen the nursery has really complimented the character this border added. it's a little pricey at $17 per roll ( i needed 3) but it's well worth it for my son, and with the quality, i know this border is going to stay right where it is and look good until i decide it's time to take it back again someday.<br /><br />overall, worth the money and work to install."
best sippy cup
works great!
"we've had this for a year now- can't beat the price. great sound! it's still going strong!! we love it. another monitor would be nice- but we didn't really need two. if the unit isn't connecting with the base- it has a really loud alarm. that is fixed by turning it off and back on- like rebooting!  but, i usually turn this off during the day when i'm at work-  so it's no big deal."
"these replacement pieces are exactly the same as the ones that come with the ameda unit.  in the image they appeared solid white to me, but when they arrived i was pleasantly surprised to find they are clear and appear to be exactly like the ones that came with the machine.<br /><br />getting these as a back-up. the first set i eventually ripped through when i used a small bottle brush to wash it.  the metal end gradually tore the plastic enough that it stopped working.  now i just use the corner of a contoured dish sponge and it works just fine."
great teether ... and the way it twists around makes it more entertaining for its purpose.
"i'm very happy with this organizer. it is a perfect size and looks exactly like it is pictured.  very well made.  the only thing that surprised me since i am used to very fast shipping and deliveries with amazon prime, is that it took about 3 weeks to receive.  but the chinese return address explains that."
"great value, get so much for the price. i don't notice a difference from the medela ones."
it's really god
"i love that these are so cheap and easy to order.  they fit my medela pump in style advanced, and they're good quality.  i find that i have a problem with getting milk in pump tubing (no matter the brand), and once that happens then it will continue to happen (even if you clean them out).  so it's easier for me to just have extra tubing on hand.  once they get milk in them a few times, i just change them out.  i also like having a second set to use when i'm cleaning out one set, since they take a bit to dry."
"we use this in our strolller and it is great!  we just leave it in there all the time, so we don't have to worry about bringing a blanket or having a blanket fall on the ground.  when it's warm, we just tuck the top of the cover under our baby's feet.  it's a wonderful product."
perfect!
"i used bibbity bibs at every feeding until my daughter was two. the catch pocket does a nice job, and the neck opening has three different slots to fit a range of sizes. the bibs went through the dishwasher with no signs of wear, and they roll up nicely for travel. the pocket also serves as a bowl for cheerios and other finger foods; a flight attendant saw my daughter eating cheerios from her bib pocket and declared she was going to buy a bibbity for her grandson. i only stopped using these bibs because they are now too short to cover my daughter's shirt. (this isn't really a design flaw. had they been longer, the catch pocket would have been below the high chair tray when my daughter was younger.)<br />for comparison, i also purchased the bjorn bib and an ikea pocket bib. the hard plastic on those was uncomfortable around my daughter's neck and did not sit well against the high chair tray."
"We used the Soothie pacifiers until my daughter had her tongue and lip tie released at 8 weeks. After that procedure, she just didn't like any pacifiers any more. I've tried 5 different types and she hates them all. :(<br /><br />Sounds like a dream but sometimes it's nice to have something that soothes her other than breastfeeding.<br /><br />I read an article on these pacis and immediately ordered a set. Yes, I received the blue and red pacis instead of the more girly ones, but I don't care. They're pefect! She loves them! At 6 months when we're already dealing with sleep regression issues and a new tooth (and one more on the way) I'm thrilled that these provide comfort.<br /><br />I'm ordering two more sets now so we're not without them.<br /><br />Also, I can't seem to find these in local stores. They have the oval ones but they're not the orthodontic ones. Amazon is the only place I can find these softflex ortho pacis for 6+ month olds."
Got as a gift for a mom to be and she loved it. Came in retail packaging and looks like the real deal. Not sure why other reviews said it was knock off?
"BeerMo Bottle & Pacifier Mustaches - 6 Pack...;  Can not go into detail, but the shenanigans where/are ten fold ;-)"
Great!
We love these pacis! Only paci my daughter likes!
"Nice product although, like other reviewers, I received pink and purple for my little boy (the package in the product image looks red but it's really pink). I was aware colors may vary but I was hoping they'd at least be gender neutral."
My son loves the MAM nipples and these are super cute.
So much easier for them and you when they are still to young to hold on to things. My son loves both of his.
Love this wubbanub
Love em.
"Of all the pacifiers I bought, my daughter only liked this one. It's also very easy to wash, just throw it in the washer!"
Great product!
Great product!
This is great! It holds 2 of your daughter's pacifiers and fits great in my diaper bag or if I need to throw it in my purse. It also has a snap on the strap so you can attach it to your bag for easy access. It stays closed well and we have not had issues with it opening unexpectedly at all.
Love these because at night they glow in the dark when the baby wakes up screaming. And sometimes he can find it himself because it glows.
"nice seller, nice item."
My daughter loves these pacifiers. They are lightweight and I like that they are one piece. There is no hard plastic that can shatter. Just one soft piece.
"There awesome! We have 3 different ones, all great."
Excellent
Super fast shipping and product as described
Excellent
Great product!!
Ive been a cowboys fan the moment I was born in 92'! My dad is a die hard fan so it's only right that I set my daughter on the right track too! The product is beautiful. I will deff be buying from this seller again!! Thank u so much
Excellent
Great set and baby loves them!
This was a little treasure I stuck into the pocket on the zebra-and-hot-pink diaper bag I found. The mother-to-be was thrilled!
My son absolutely loves it!
My son received one of these in the hospital and he consistently loves this brand.
This thing changed my baby's sleeping life!  He could finally get back to sleep on his own in his bed or in his car seat once I gave him this WubbaNub that he could easily find and get to his mouth on his own.
"My son never really used a pacifier but he loves to use these as teething toys, because they are easy for him to hold and manipulate."
I love these. We had a long plane trip and had these on hand. Easy to use.
Best thing EVER invented!  ;oP
Great bottles and the gift set is a good deal if you compare prices at any store that sells them!
"My daughter absolutely LOVES her WubbaNub! I introduced it at a little over month originally because she had such a horrible time keeping pacifiers in her mouth! She would get so frustrated and angry. While the WubbaNub didn't solve ALL of our issues, it certainly helped. My daughter is exclusively breastfed and isn't really fond of pacifiers, but she absolutely adores her WubbaNub tiger. Now that she's older (4 months), she likes to hold on to his little legs or pet it. She honestly spends more time with the stuffed animal part than the pacifier!<br /><br />Her caretakers at daycare noticed how much it soothes her. We forgot it one day and well, let's just say that wasn't a good day for anyone... I think it's adorable that it gives her both something to suck on (and sometimes gnaw on), as well as comfort with the stuffed animal. I'll be sad when we have to take it away when she actually starts sprouting teeth! We'll probably just cut it off the pacifier and sew it closed, ha.<br /><br />To clean it, I usually just wipe off the pacifier. Since she takes it to daycare, I'll handwash the tiger in Dapple soap at least once every week or so and then hang it to dry."
So cute!
We are on Giraffe #2. After a year of heavy use and many washes the original &#34;G&#34; tore away from the paci. This is a great size for even the littlest of hands and my son loves to pull on all of the appendages. We also had a puppy one but my son would always reach for this one first.
My baby is 9 months old and has had these since birth. They hold up well. They are easy to clean. Easy to find because the animals are more viable than a bouncy little binky. Very cute!! But the dog got this one the day it made it to us. So we are sad.
"Adorable design.  I was worried the glow in the dark feature would distract my baby.  It did not.  And as a bonus, it made it MUCH easier to find his paci in the middle of the night after he had dropped/thrown it."
"This is the only pacifier my son would take and we now own so many of them. They are light and easy for newborns and young babies to hold onto, but haven't caused any nipple confusion. The design is really thoughtful and we'd recommend this to any new parent--although each kid is different, these seem to be really especially made for the younger ones."
Great product! Had for months now with no issues or flaws.
they are good but m baby just would not take this paci
One of my baby's favorite pacifier!! Really cute!! The shape makes it really easy for baby to hold. The material is easy to maintain clean. Love this paci.
Thank you very much. Everything as expected
"Since the day he was born, my son has refused to use any pacifier that doesn't have a stuffed animal attached to it.  He now has several WubbaNubs and loves them all, but the dragon is my (and now his) personal favorite.  It's pretty bad ass walking around with a baby who's got a dragon hanging from his mouth.  :)"
love this item
"Since the day he was born my son has refused to suck on a pacifier unless it has a stuffed animal attached to it.  WubbaNub is the absolute best, and this monkey is very cute.  I highly recommend buying a few different nubs, because your child won't want anything else!"
My grandson loves his Wubbanub. He is able to keep this pinky in his mouth while the others would just pop right out.  He gets soon excited when he sees his 'Wubby'!
Great pacifier.  It is our son's favorite brand.
"This actually stays in the baby's mouth quite well. And because of it's size, it stays on the baby's chest and off the floor when he does flip it out of his mouth. Not to mention how cute it is. And the nipple part is compatible for the needs of a new born because it is more nipple shaped. I was grateful to be able to use it for my newborn."
"This is the ONLY pacifier my one month old son will take. It's spendy for a pacifier but worth it, and it's adorable."
so cute
The baby was very happy with her new pacifier!
"I tried making my own WubbaNub-type pacifier bear from a little plush toy and a spare pacifier.  My daughter will use it in a pinch, but clearly prefers the brand WubbaNub pink bear.  She loves the bear body is so soft and squishy.  She also likes to play with the soft tag.  I think when she weans off the pacifier, she will want to keep the bear part as a lovey.  This bear makes it so easy to find the pacifier, especially in a car seat.<br /><br />The only thing is that it is a little harder to clean than a traditional pacifier that can be run through a sterilizer or through the dishwasher.  I boil some water, add a few drops of antibacterial essential oil like lavender, and dip the pacifier end in to soak for a few minutes.  To clean the bear part, I occasionally run the entire item through the laundry washer in a delicates bag, and let air dry."
Good
"Baby loves it, especially at night or morning when she's looking for her binky!  Easy to find and grasp for babies!"
"depending on which pacifiers i choose I can actually put 2 in here! very convenient, I like that I can clip it onto the stroller."
Excellent !!
"Baby's favorite, and he can hold it!!"
Love it!
perfect
Cute
great bibs. super soft. very trendy.
good carseat!
this was just what i needed for my grandbaby. easy to assemble and fold down but imposible to put back in it's bag. otherwise it is perfect.
"really awesome for any full sized adjustable headrest. didn't work on the middle seat of my honda van, the headrest was too small, but i installed it on the side seat (the seat beside where the car seat is installed). i do need to take it down if someone is sitting there, but it is quick and easy to install. my 1-year old likes to look in the mirror and see me, and it is plenty big. i can see her entire seat easily - no distortions, and it isn't too small. it will shake a tad when driving, but my main objective is to see if she was in distress, and i can see well enough. the angle adjusts well and stays put. much better than other mirror options i have tried."
these letter/numbers are great. my two year played with them for the first time yesterday in the shower. they stick easily on both glass and porcelain on both sides so he could easily put them wherever he wanted using either side. the bag is great and keeps the letters from ending up all over the place. my only minor complaint is that the draw string closes pretty easily and was hard for my toddler to get the letters in the bag without some help. i don't know that there is anything that can be done about that and in the end it's extremely minor. all in all some great toys. can't wait to work on spelling and letter recognition with him in the bath.
easy to manage and control love the color!!!
nice storage bottles for breast milk. i use them every day.
"best cups ever! not only are they made from recycled milk bottles (yay!), they're cute - and they are the only sippy cups i have that i truly trust not to leak - even if they're left upside down or on their side in my bag. i have tried them all... seriously. they all leak. many won't leak most of the time, but as soon as something touches the spout, they will. these are perfect. as long as you put the interior piece on correctly, it stays on, and i have been using the same 3 cups with my 2 kids for over 3 years, and they are still working as well as day one. highly recommend.<br /><br />i will say that family members who try and put the inner piece in sometimes put it on backwards, and no water comes out, but it is easily fixed and neither me nor my husband have ever had a problem confusing the direction it should go."
my baby's favorite toy.
"these washcloths were purchased for adult use.  i was originally looking for a 100% cotton washcloth to replace some worn ones i have.  after reading some of the reviews, i decided to order a pack of the brooklyn bamboo baby washcloths.  when i received the shipment, unfortunately i had a rough place on my finger that snagged and pulled the threads on one of the washcloths.  i went ahead and placed all of the washcloths in the washer and dryer so that my husband and i could use them that night.  when i took them out of the dryer, the snagged place was not even noticeable.  the washcloths were very soft.  i was able to soap up the washcloth for my shower without having to continue re-soaping the washcloth as i had previously had to do with the old washcloths.  this turned out to be a side benefit for saving soap. my husband and i are both very satisfied with the purchase."
absolutely beautiful!  love it!!!!
Awesome!
So cute...
Very impressed!
"These are the greatest binkys ever! My first refused any other kind but these, and yes I do believe that it's all baby preference. .. but they are easy to find,come in many colors ( which js awesome bc my older one has transitioned to the blue Super Soothie for older babies, tougher rubber for teeth) easy to wash, they work with all binky leashes and I cannot say enough good things about these especially when they keep my kids happy!!"
Our son loved this around 3 months. I would highly recommend it.
amazing
Love! Works well as a weighted pacifier for my daughter. It's harder for her to lose it out of her mouth.
"Different babies like different pacifiers, so if these didn't work for some it doesn't mean they won't work for you. That being said, my baby isn't super picky about his pacifier. He will suck on Avents, Chiccos, and these. Both Orthopedic and Natural shaped. But, these are by far his favorite. I think he prefers the natural shape, but I also love these because they are flexible (no hard plastic which sometimes digs into his cheeks with others) and they are also just one formed piece, which is safer (no risk of the nipple coming off the plastic handle)."
"We are total fans of this pacifier!! Things we love about it: the pacifier stays put in the baby's mouth longer, it's easy for the baby to grab, it doesn't fall as often, it's cute, the baby can suck on the pacifier or the doll, and it's easy to find.  We is easy to wash.  Everyday we wash it with soap and water, then we have the paci part sit in a bowl of hot boiling water.  Once in a while, I put it in a basket and put it in the wash.  We got two as a baby shower gift and bought another one just in case."
Good
We love wubbanubs! The only thing I don't like about it is after your child grows out of this stage of paci you Can't switch it out and you can't detach the pacifier to wash the stuffed animal part in the washer. Its kind of sad throwing it away.
I think our 2 month old is starting to hug this cute guy when she is soothing herself.  It also makes for some sweet pictures with two sets of big eyes.
This is a great product! In fact I ordered another one right after
"Love this. Bought this for my daughter when she was about 4 months old, and now she can easily find her binky at night without fully waking up (or waking me up!). She's 10 months now, and she brings it everywhere."
Every newborn gets one of these as a gift from me as they become their favorite!
"Best thing ever, so helpful to have and keep track of the binks!"
These are some great pacifiers. Our daughter is teething.  These will last a week before showing signs of wear versus other brands that she has wore out in two days or less.
As NICU nurse I can heartily recommend the Wubbanubs. As a grandmother I even more heartily recommend. One is not enough
"This is good, my baby after very well"
"These apparently are the only pacifiers my daughter will take and keep in her mouth. Everything else she spits out, even the silicone ones of the same brand. Wish there was more latex selection in Mam brand."
Although it doesn't close when dropped (it closes after being dropped face down or if dropped on the side the nipple is safe) but atleast beats the hassle of carrying the cover around.
"These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take. They are molded symmetrically?so if she takes it out and puts it back in her mouth upside down, it is still the same shape, and she is still happy."
Lots of fun!
Best pacifiers we've found...we've bought 4 and will buy more.  Slight curve fits well for sleeping babies.
great holding power. one suction is applied handle will not move. excellent
love this idea. i have a 2 year old who is potty training.  this will be perfect for traveling and camping.
works like a charm. great buy for traveling and keeping baby happy!
this butterfly was even prettier in person.  i think it's really gorgeous and the colors are perfect.
very nice!  great way to store baby's pacifier! i bought it for my daughter-in-law and she liked it a lot.  it matched her diaper bag very well!
great
purchased this before our baby was born in fall 2013 despite mixed reviews. after 17mos of use it is still in excellent shape and the lightweight feature makes changing sheets so much easier. highly recommend!
my granddaughter loves the different colors of lights from this ladybug :-)
worth every penny when you are changing the crib sheets.
Both parents loved these! The pink hat was a little big for a newborn but they like the carhartt pink!
"My husband and I were so afraid to offer a pacifier given how hard I was working on establishing breastfeeding. However, our little girl has such a strong suck reflex and need for comfort that it was best for her. This was the only brand that she would touch. We tried five others and she spit them out. The size is amazing for newborns. She is 6 weeks and still uses it. There has been no nipple confusion at all with this. We are so grateful and highly recommend these!"
I love these pacifiers. They are perfect for my little one to hold on to.
My grandbabies love this!  It's a nice size/shape to hold and they can get the pacifier into their mouths pretty easily.
Wonderful the only pacifier my son will tak.
Amazing.  SO AMAZING.  My little guy sleeps with this every night and he has for the past 17 months.  We bought a spare just in case!
it is good.
very good~
Absolutely love it I'm going to have to buy more 
Happy I received the correct item
Great as a gift or for your own little one.
Great price and so fun! My baby doesn't like many other pacifiers. Tommie Tippee evidently knows how to mimic an actual nipple when compared to other brands.
My 3-month old loves these!  They are lightweight and easy to clean.  The handle is very useful too.
Ok
Perfect price for these great soothers.
My grandbaby loves this sooo much!!
Absolutely adorable.
Baby loves his wubbanubs! Zebra is super cute and attractive to baby due to the black and white high contrast. The easiest of our wubbanubs to find in the dark.
This is a backup to the one we already have. They wash up great and needed one for when the other is being laundered. Not a clean sock or mesh bag is great for protecting it from other items and hang dry in less than a day.
"Great pacifiers. So great, my dogs won't stop eating them. I'm convinced they smell like dog treats so that I have to continue buying pacifiers each month. Conspiracy?!"
These are amazing
Love these pacis! All 3 of my kids have loved these and took them the easiest at birth and beyond. The only disadvantage is that most pacifier clips don't work with these.
Cute and fun faces. Baby loves it.
"So cute, soft & beautiful!! Love it!!!!!"
My lo LOVES LOVES LOVES her goon goon kitty! She has used it since day 1 and is 18 months old. I wash it in the washer once a week or so and put it in the dryer in a pillow case. The pacifier part is starting to sgow wear but we are about to weam her off and just give her the animal. Perfect timing! We will most definately be buying this product for the next baby. When she was tiny I loved it bc it would help her keep it in her mouth.
Great
So cute!
After many attempts to find a pacifier that my son would take we settled on Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature. There is no upside down as with other brands as the symmetrical shape allows for your little one to put the pacifier in all by themselves with no fuss.  Now when someone gives him a different brand he immediately spits it out and reaches for this one.  The 0-6 months pacifiers were used constantly and we never had an issue with any of them wearing out or needing to be replaced.  The only downside is the cute designs on the face will scratch off between being placed in the dishwasher to clean and little fingers grasping for the pacifier.
"We were gifted these at our shower - along with some other popular orthodontic-based pacificers in more traditional shapes. With our little one's tiny face and how giant this shape looked, I didn't bother trying them. Until about 2 weeks in, when I decided to sterilize them and add them to her rotation just because.<br /><br />Well surprise! She only loves these now - to the point they actually work and help her quiet down to sleep (no idea about nipple confusion, we exclusively pump) and we ordered more!"
My baby girl loves this cute little binky/lovie! I think I'm buy another from this seller as a back up!!
Love this product! My daughter loves it and I love how they can cuddle with it!
Everyone got a kick out this very funny mustache. It has been the main thing for the baby when taking pics
bought this as a gift for a friend expecting twins.  they love it because they now they don't need dual monitors.
"the 7 am le sac igloo is great !!! very warm and easy access. love it so much and my 5 months old loves it too as she is very comfortable in it, we use l.l beans before this and find the 7 am much warmer for my baby. will recommend anyone to get one and try it out to know the experience."
great seat for my grandson once he reached 6 months. even take it to restaurants. he loves it!
excellent for price
daughter in law and son really have used the belly buds. clever!
very cute addition to our playroom
love this bag! it's so convenient to wear when traveling with a little one. it has tons of compartments and its very cute. i'm constantly getting asked where it's from. i highly recommend it and wish i would have found it sooner!
great quality. perfect size for my grandchildren
i got exactly what i expected
love dr. brown bottles
very easy to use and very sturdy.
This is the only pacifier my daughter would use. We love our WubbaNub Monkey!
good
Great pacifiers. Quality plastic and the baby loves them. Bought two packs to make sure we don't lose any.
Sam kind we received from hosp. Baby loves them
My new born loved these!
"great, exactly what we needed"
It's my baby's favorite pacifier now!
good
loved it
has everything a mother would need (grooming wise) even has toy.
never had one before but i think it's great quality for a great price.
definitely worth it! it worked and made pumping time go by faster because i could use my hands!!!! i loved it!
great product and price.
these are so soft. we are about to have our 5th baby and i ordered one of these to try. i wish i'd found them sooner! i will be purchasing more.
"a great owl to add to my toddler's growing collection.  this guy is quite large, too!  we call him &#34;big owl.&#34; not really good for cuddling up with, but he's a keeper anyway."
"great quality, plenty of options for sound and volume. projector is great and holds extra options for projection pictures."
"we moved to this from our infant bucket seat and are very happy with it. our 13-month-old is still sitting in it rear-facing (she's 60% for height) and she's very comfortable. lots of padding, she seems comfortable, and it's a super-easy install with the latch system."
really cute bed.  just perfect as my grandson's first toddler bed.  easy to put together.
got this battery after my graco monitor battery ran out after heavy use for two years.  installed this battery without and issues.  recharged without any problems.  works great!  have been using the monitor with the new batteries for about 2 weeks now without any problems.
"amazing quality, lots of room! very impressed:) can't wait to use it!"
Very good product our boy loved it.
"We love the Wubbanub! My only wish would be for the pacifier to be rated hire than 6 months. Still worth 5 stars. Easy to wash, easy to find, and well worth the money!"
My grandson loves it! It is easy to find when you need it.
Fast shipping and great product!
excellent
Great paci. It came free with the car seat and is my daughters favorite.
The keep it keen pacifier works almost every time keeping the pacifier free of germs when dropped.
6 months later and my daughter is still in love with this thing!
My daughter is in love with the wub a nub. If your child uses soothie pacifiers these are a must. I like them because they are hard to lose with the size.
My baby is most thug on tha block now #onelove
Love these!
My favorite.!
Baby is very happy using this.
Our favorite paci's by far and we have tried TONS and tons with all 3 kids.
"I love how conveniently packed it was, and that it came before my little girl's expected arrival!! Thank you! Will definitely be ordering another one soon!!"
Does the job and my daughter likes these pacifiers over other brands. Easy to clean too.
great bottle for my baby!  breastfed at home and bottle fed at the babysitter.  very easy transition.
"shipped in a timely manner. product exactly as shown, and packaged nicely! will be very cute in pictures"
excellent!!!
"love these diaper covers! i have four other thirsties duo wraps, 3 of them are also hook & loop. we prefer the hook and loop, it's easier to get a good fit on my chubby thighed baby. the velcro is very strong on these. i've only been cloth diapering for about 5 months, and i wash every 2-3 days and they have held up great so far. it seems like the velcro will last for a long time. i use these over prefolds during the day, and over fitted diapers at night. my son is a chunky 23 lb 6 month old and he's wearing size 2 on the smallest setting, so these should fit for a long time!"
good items
great for little accidents
this is the cutest and much loved item my great-grandson has.  he loves it and it soothes him which i believe is most important for a teething baby.
looks good. sturdy and spacious.
these are exactly what i wanted.  they fit my 8 month old and 2 year old.  very easy to clean and quick to dry.  love them!
i love it! i have large breasts and this fit perfectly the first time!
"love this tree. it was exactly what i was looking for. easy to apply, just time consuming. looks great!!"
"Great design, soft cover mom dad and baby like it!"
"So far my FAV wubbanub!! Love it, get compliments all the time and it's soooo cute!!"
It is perfect. My baby loves it. I do recommend.
Really help me find them at night
"These paci's glow brightly in the dark, I was very pleased with them! Well worth the money spent!"
My newborn only seemed to like these pacifiers for some reason. I would recommend buying a couple as they do get lost easily.
"Great in the car at night, prefect for finding in their crib in the dark.  So cute. Mam are  the best pacifiers. These were perfect for my 3mos old grandson. They are well made and easy to clean."
My son is obsessed with these. Plus they're super easy to spot if they fly across the room!!
Cute print and great for night time!
Great Love it Thanks A  lot
cute baby gift
it was funny for adiaper cake
These are the best baby gifts to buy!
"Have not tried it yet, but it looks good."
excellent cup for my 9 month old. the spout is soft and flexible.
very cute idea. the chalkboard goes with all outfits and is unisex.
"i bought this one as a gift, but had 2 different britax back seat mirrors of my own and they are all great. convenient and a must have for rear facing kiddos."
so much easier to carry this around!!!!
i use this to wash cloth diapers. it works great and always gets out the stains.
thank you<br />  all arrived safely
"my almost 3 year old is still using it. he climbs on it so easily, and is relatively easy to clean."
"love these! my son sometimes pees all over and has projectile poo, so these come in handy. i bought two packs."
nice.  well made.
"great price, arrived quick, and as expected"
"love these bibs.  they're a must-have once your little one starts feeding herself.  i would've been changing her clothes a lot more often with a traditional bib!  this catches all the milk she dumbs, food that falls out of her mouth, etc."
my grandaughter loves this on her wall she recently got her own room and now it is all decorated in paris love love love this on the wall
great purchase
using these along with belly bands really extended my regular wardrobe further into my pregnancy.  i recommend these to all expectant moms!!
"love the glasses.  i purchased them for my 22 month old grandchild, and they are unbreakable, the first challenge they went through was being twisted around and they made it.  good price also."
"Love the soft nipple, and the fact it is one piece.  It's the only pacifier either of my breastfed kids would use."
Perfect; Recomended !!!
"Absolutely adorable, a must have."
"My son (currently 3.5 months old) only likes the Avent Soothie pacifiers, so when I found these, I was very excited. They aren't the cheapest, but it was worth the money. Before my son could grab, I would put this on his chest, and it would stay close to him even when he spit out the pacifier (and he was less likely to spit it out because the kitten held it some). Now that he is learning to use his hands, he loves to grab the kitten and pull whatever part of it he grabs (usually a foot) into his mouth. To wash it, I just throw it into the washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry. It turns out great. The kitten is high quality and should hold up to quite a bit of stress as he gets older. When it drops to the floor, it doesn't bounce like the pacifier would without the kitten, so I haven't lost it in the 2 months we've been using it."
Love these! Helps my baby keep it in her mouth & she loves snuggling them especially the lamb!
"These are amazing.  I have one in every space (kitchen, purse, car, stroller, diaper bag) to keep a clean pacifier- they are so handy.  The hook is perfect!"
Great binkies
always love these...easy for baby to hold
These are very well made & priced well. I got them as decorative for a baby shower to top a gift. Nice pastel colors to choose from
Love these! They dont lave marks on baby's face.
Both of my children love mam pacis and bottles. These are adorable and a good fit for a newborn's face.
Ok
Best things ever made. I don't ever lose the pacifiers and it keeps me from buy some every week. Easy to wash also.
"Although my daughter didn't take to these (we have the cow too) at first,  now that she can more easily grasp onto it herself, she loves them."
Love this product!!!! Fast service
"Had the newborn one and now bought these since he's 4 months old. Baby loves loves it, he calms down right away. He doesn't get nipple confusion either. I can take it away and breastfeed him right afterwards. I so suggest to wait atleast month after baby is born if you want to avoid nipple confusion"
Great for finding in a dark room in the night!
My grand daughters love it!
"I love this Pacifier, I bought it  for my son and he sucks it. I have gotten so many compliments on it."
This is basically the best idea since diapers and onesies. My son loves his monkey so much he holds hands with him when he sleeps. We bought several so we have them in all his nap places.
"super soft! stays soft after washing and doesn't stain. the blue color is true to the photo. fits the summer infant changing pad perfectly; however, there aren't any holes to fit the pad's safety straps through, but that was no problem for us as we don't use them (we use the pad on the floor of our living room when changing diapers downstairs). the price can't be beat!"
ok
"we strapped these to our car seat and love them. the rattle noise is a soothing sound, not hard and plastic sounding. the colors captivate our little one."
color match perfectly with my son's bed
love this product! this product fits nicely and is soft and well made.
i really like the way this looks.  easy to put together.  perfect storage solution for the price.  doesn't look cheap and about to fall apart all the time.
i bought this after accidentally flashing a stranger at a children's museum in my old cover. this is a great size and keeps me covered even with a wiggly 6 month old. the pattern is cute too.
for $8 this hammock is huge. perfect for my daughters room.
all is good here.no issues.fast shipping.packs really well.what more can i ask more.aaaaaaaaaa
"expensive - yes, but lasts for days. the hospital gave me a free sample and i loved it. really helped with the pain and healing process."
"these are incredibly soft (much softer than any other brand i've tried), thick enough to prevent leaks and launder much better than i was expecting...they still look new after months of washing. would recommend a larger quantity if using daily...i immediately wished i had bought more."
i love them!
i order my new grandchildren these banks.  i love them&#62;
i use these for dog beds! they work great!!!
this works really well!  i was surprised.
perfect size and style.  great value as well
i bought this for my grandchild.  it is much easier to tighten with the knobs that i found fussing with the strap in the front that is in my daughter's car.
i'm not super thrilled about the sort of fancy edges of these however having a drawer full of solid white mittens where i can just grab any two has been fantastic.  i have to really pull on the elastic to keep them from digging into his skin but he maybe has chubbier than usual wrists and once i pull them till they pop once or twice they fit fine.  why on earth do babys socks and mittens only come in packs where you never have more than two that match each other? ugh!
"excellent, thank you"
"this comes in handy quite often.  the colors are bright, the material is durable and best of all, it folds up into a small carrying case that you can throw just about anywhere.  (we keep ours in the trunk of our car but it barely takes up space in the base of the stroller if we take it for picnics)."
very nice. my preschooler loves it.
just what we needed to avoid the pacifier from always falling out! nice soft animal makes for a cute lovie!
excellent
"super cute,"
"i love ecoable diapers,  especially the charcoal bamboo ones,  less staining to worry about. they also have a wonderful double leg gusset that eliminates leaking.  i also love the snap placement, more options for the best fit. also, you have the pocket option for doubling inserts for longer wear,  but the sewn in pad is great and seems perfectly sufficient.<br />i am comparing the ecoable diapers to alva and kawai. with both of those, you'll notice leaking around the edges.  with ecoable you will have a harder time knowing when a change is needed, which is a good thing right?<br />i'd like to see more gender neutral patterns,  and call me crazy but i'd like solids in basic white or black."
great gate!!
Works perfect on wide stairs to keep dogs out.
These are virtually indestructible. Exactly what we needed!
"This kitty is so cute. My son was rejecting all pacifier, then started taking this one when I offered it to him. he likes to hold on to it. I love that it helps keep the paci in his mouth and it's cute!"
Too cute and at a great price.  Thank you
All is good here.No issues.Fast shipping.Packs really well.What more can I ask more.AAAAAAAAAA
great bag looks like it will hold everything
"I wish I would have known about these sooner! They are a definite must have for car seats, along with everything else! They are so easy to find in the dark in the crib! I will be buying these for new moms from now on!"
These glow for a long time make making it easy to find at night.
Baby boy loved them.
Love the glow feature! My son likes to throw his paci around and this makes it super easy to find in the middle of the night. He has even been able to find it on his own if it stays in the crib!
Just what we needed to avoid the pacifier from always falling out! Nice soft animal makes for a cute lovie!
Our newborn loved this product! It was the only pacifier she would use.
"My 2 year old is just addicted to pack's, she used to only take the Avent ones but was willing to use these as well.  Cute designs and soothes a fussy girl.  Prices are good so I buy extra because you never want to be without a paci!"
perfect
All is good here.No issues.Fast shipping.Packs really well.What more can I ask more.AAAAAAAAAA
Good
"My son loves this, had it for 8 months, still in one place :)"
Very cute! Haven't used it yet but my son has a few others and he loves them. Great for a 3 month old to hold on to.
Love mam pacifiers! They are the only ones any of my kids will use!
"My baby loves this particular brand, I'm not sure why maybe because they fit better orally in his mouth then other cheap brands. Like that they are backed by the Orthodontal docs!"
"I love this pacifire! We used the plain ones and they were always falling out and into the ground. With the kitty attached it sits nicely on her Chest & she hugs it! Very light weight, adorable & great quality! Highly recommended"
Adorable pacifier. My daughter loves these. About 5 inches long. Perfect for little hands. Wish pacifier was interchangeable
"I love these, they were excellent when my baby was 1-6 months."
GOOD
My daughter absolutely loves it. It's do useful for car trips!
Good seller fast will buy again thanks
NICE
My son loves this Binky! Its so soft and since he's a little older it fits perfectly in his mouth (6+ months one)
Got these for a co-worker and fellow Packer fan.  She LOVED them!
My kid loved to traditional avent pacifier. I decided to try these and they worked really well also! Cute and easy to hang onto with the more traditional handle.
These pacifiers are AWESOME! They do indeed glow in the dark and boy do they glow! My daughter is 6 months and constantly loses her pacifier in the night resulting in me having to zombie out of bed to find it for her! But now she finds it herself!
"my friend told me she loved this calendar, so i bought it for another friend.  i hope she'll enjoy it just as much!  :)  i think it's a great, easy supplement or alternative to a baby book.  seems very simple, user friendly and cute!"
i bought this and several others of this brand to make a cloth diaper cake for my sister-in-law. they were a great quality and worked out really nicely!
i love angel dear blankies and napping blankets.  i bought the giraffe napping blanket for my best friend's daughter 7 years ago and it's been passed down to her little sister and still looks and feels amazing even after 7 years of washing.  the tiger stripe blankie is just as cute and was a no brainer to buy as part of a baby shower gift set.
"very satisfied a shopping experience, product quality is very good, very satisfied with the speed of logistics"
perfect present for the newest member of a lovely family!
this item was purchased as a gift. we were told by the parents that the baby likes it and is convenient for both the parents and the baby. it arrived quickly and was as described.
bought as a baby shower gift. expecting parents loved the gift an idea.
love this. it's easy to install and makes your tv safe from accidental tipping. i'd rather be safe then sorry.
love this bag. i also love that the changing table is attached to it. super stylish and fits everything i need!
"this works!  i can't tell you how many things i tried to soothe my screaming baby - all the &#34;old wives&#34; remedies, and a few things i found at the drugstore. nothing worked. finally i found this tea. i liked that it was natural, so i ordered it. i can tell you that my little one is now calmer, sleeping better, and i am thrilled."
great bath toy!!
great product. must-have item for nursing mommies! :-)
fits all my son's stuffed animals! very well made material!
"easy to use, and baby does not mind it."
perfect
these are the only pacifiers that will stay in my 2 months old mouth for more than 30 seconds! we have the giraffe and the lamb. i wash them on gentle in the washing machine with no problem.  this has literally helped save my sanity. our wubbanub arrived on time in the expected condition.
very pleased with the quality!
very comfortable .....good quality.......easy to install....didn't take more than 20 mins.
"i tried using both a bouncer and a swing for my colicky 2month old, but neither seemed to work. although the mamaroo is a little pricier than swings/bouncers, it sure is worth it. my daughter loves being on it. highly recommended."
love this bag! perfect for lugging around the basics for my two toddlers. my husband appreciates that it's gender neutral :)
worked out great ;)
my  grand daughter  loves  it and  uses  it  several  times  a day
way easier for my 1-year- old to hold and get to her mouth than the super long and kinda skinny nuby ones i also have. these are definitely well designed for a learner!
"works great. after use i just rinse off in warm soapy water , let dry and use later. it's great because i don't need to put them in the washing machine"
perfect for my sons bed he loves them
"i love this chair! i take it with me every time i head out of town or to a restaurant. i love its small size, portability, and practical design. it's easy to use clean."
so cute and sturdy..
great toy! easy to grasp and bring to baby's mouth. i also bought the 4 inch ball and baby loves both.
affordable  and effective
"love that this company makes an effort for non-toxic toys, very well made teether. also really love that these can be put in the freezer as there are not a lot of non-toxic options that are freezable! hope to see more products from this company"
"Very good, anatomic and with excellent design."
Excellent product on time
"I purchased this for a baby shower gift. It is absolutely adorable, comes with protective cover to protect the nipple. Was delighted with quality and fast shipment."
Love these!! My son chewed through his glow in the dark pacifiers and so I had to throw them away. I did not realize how great the glow in the dark feature is until we had to use a &#34;daytime&#34; binky at night. I just wish Avent wouldn't make some of their pacifiers with a &#34;right way&#34; to go in. But I'm not counting off a star over it because even when upside down my son doesn't seem to notice or mind.
Great
Very good Item
My baby loved these MAM pacifiers. The glow in the dark function is nice for sleep deprived parents in the middle of the night. We used these during the day too -  I like the subdued colors. Makes it far less garish than some of those huge colorful pacis out there. We did have to start using the larger 6+ month version because these are quite small. Not a one-size-fits-all deal.
"There isn't much more to say about wubbanub pacifiers, other than that they are simply amazing. They help keep up with the paci when it goes flying across the room. It's easy to clean and wash it, and my kid absolutely loves it! We have three different animal versions of this paci!"
So cute
"Best place to get is here on amazon, I've looked! These have a smaller outer plastic than traditional avent paci and allow more air. I tried several different brands but Avent are the only ones she likes. Thank you for the calm nights! Haha!"
Love it.
"Awesome! Kids love  these, just wish I could remove the plush pet from the pacifier to wash it... Otherwise it's great."
Its great to be able to get an all natural product with no compromise. These are great and our baby loves them.
Good product. I like it
"Good quality paci, wish my daughter would like it"
"So cute!  I bought this for a friend's baby boy.  He really loves holding the giraffe while using the pacifier.  And, his Mom says she can cut the pacifier off when he gets older and keep the stuffed giraffe."
They are so cute!
my daughter loves this cup. i will be ordering a few more. happy to get rid of the plastic cups.
gave this to my daughter and she said it works so good!!!
love it!! works great!
very soft quality
beautiful frame. thank you.
"this product is a life saver. my son was 4 weeks old & only sleeping 1-2hrs at a time before i found this product. within a week of getting the wedge system & pairing it with a swaddler, he slept through the night! it makes him feel more secure & it gives me piece of mind knowing that he can't turn over in his sleep. he is now 6 mos old & still using it every night. such a simple product that made such a huge impact in my life. i would recommend it to anyone struggling to get their baby to sleep through the night."
"a little gross to think about but it works so well on my two week old as well as on my 20 month old, plus after reading about the inevitable mold that grows in classic bulb syringe, i had to give this a shot."
"my baby daughter will only use this kind of pacifier. she is breastfeed and she would not take the other kinds, especially  the orthodontic kind with the funny end."
good size for 10 months - 1 year. my grandson enjoys pushing/chasing the car.
Love this!!! Just what my grand-daughter needed when hers was destroyed. It arrived very quickly and saved the day.
"Love these. Rather than buying separate stuffed animals and pacifiers/nooks, this gives the baby something to hold onto, helps them find it when upset, and are generally just awesome. This particular one was for a gift and they love it."
"These are my daughter's favorite pacifiers, and they're so much easier to find at night with the glow in the dark!"
Good quality
We love wubbanubs!
works great
Love these.
perfect
These were the only pacifires my daughter would take so I'm so glad I was able to find them outside of the hospital.
Great pacifier.  This brand is the only one our granddaughter will take!
"Love the holiday moose. The plaid accents are really cute, and this one feels slightly higher quality construction compared to the already high quality of other Wubbanubs. Purchased as a replacement to our first Wubbanub which lasted nearly 8 months of hard usage. If you don't have a Wubbanub, I strongly recommend them for babies."
"Terrific product! We were given one of these as a gift, and we loved it so much that we bought another so as to never be without one. In fact, I'm buying some as gifts to other expecting parents."
Came early !!!<br />Baby not here yet but my son only liked the hospital kind. So I got these for my baby girl !!!
good
Perfect.
"Loved the item, purchased it for my sister and her unborn son...she loved it!!!"
Bought a couple to give away as gifts. Super cute.
My baby loved these. We only used the until about 2.5 months. These were the only type she took.
Used this with my reborn baby and it gives the look of the old fashioned paci's.
Best pacifiers! Doesn't make my baby suck in air
Soo cute! As others have posted I'm sure it will be a pain to keep clean but I knew that when we bought it...had to get it for the dragon. Haven't used it yet because we're still waiting on our son to come home from nicu but I'm sure he'll love it cause it the same pacifier that the hospital uses.
"we love this wubbanub and wish they sold this animal in stores,"
"They're binkies, for a better price than in stores. If you don't have prime, they're a great item to bump you up to free shipping if you need them. And who doesn't always need spare pacifiers if you have an infant."
So so cute. I got this for a friend's baby shower. It's adorable. Thank you so much!
"These are my (and my baby's) favorite pacifiers. I love them because they are natural rubber, made of one piece (so no hidden moisture/mold/bacteria issues) and have the lowered curve to go below the nose. The handle is also super easy for my baby to hold and bends easily in case she falls asleep with it and rolls to the side. It doesn't poke her in the face like others I've used. We also have the Ummy and while it's similar I don't like how big the base is...it covers too much of my baby's face for my comfort, despite the holes in it. It's also harder to figure out which way is 'up' when it's dark and I'm trying to quickly put the pacifier in so she can fall back asleep...having the dipped curve in the base makes it to much easier. Since the whole thing is rubber my now teething baby likes to gum the entire thing when she's not using it for its intended purpose. It's kind of funny to watch.  I was at Whole Foods the other day and saw the Eco Piggy, which I almost bought to try but didn't based on the reviews of the bulb part being huge. So I took it out to look at it and sure enough, it's massive! Unless you have a mammoth sized baby I'd skip that one. We're both happy with the Natursutten so I'm sticking to this one.  For those who have complained about the rubber smell/taste...just wash and sterilize it a couple of times and that goes away."
Very cute.
"My 1 year old grandson loved his first wubbanub and is now on his second, and loves it even more.  This is so worth getting in that it never gets lost and tiny hands can grab it and place it in their mouths so easily."
It's adorable & well made...my toddler granddaughter loved it!
Now this is the bomb.. Get alot of looks and works great
Item was clean. It arrived fast and on time. My baby loves it! Thank you! :)
"This is the second one I have bought because my lo lost her first &#34;Raffie&#34; at the mall r.i.p Raffie! She is very atttached to him and so we got a new one! I absolutely love these things, they helped improve her motor skills and helped her self soothe which in turn she slept through the night which was big because she was a preemie! I suggest them to every parent out there as they will be something for your child to have and save you from putting one back in every few minutes!<br /><br />I read a few reviews about how they are poorly made and I think these people are just nuts it's perfect for a small baby soft and they can tug,chew or throw them as they are just plush!"
My babies favorite pacificer.
Had to buy this after the dog ate her first one. Rush order! Can't live without it!!
Items were clean and as described! My baby loves it! :) thank you
We are huge john deere fans but just beware they do not have bulbs on  the end to help the baby keep it in their mouth and they many not take any other binky. But on that note they are perfect for nursing babies as they are more natural in shape.
nice
these are the only pacifiers I buy for my babies. They are all natural and are easy to clean with no cracks or seams. It is all one continuous piece so there are no place for germs to hideout.
Perfect Box for a pacifier. I love it.
shipping was fast. and bag was exactly as it was decribed and pictured. gave it as gift and she loved it!
really cute
such a fun toy... reminds me of my childhood!!
love this little machine. i only wish i had found it sooner. worth every penny!
My daughter LOVES these! She learned early on to find it on her own while sleeping. At one I took the pacifier away by cutting it off and it was a smooth transition because she was so used to the comfort of the kitten she forgot about the pacifier.
"My son did not like this. That is not to say it's a bad Product, soothie type pacifiers just don't work for him. This is well made and clean and he did enjoy holding the giraffe portion, even if he didn't make use of the pacifier. Perfect size for an infant to practice holding items."
Very cute and very funny to look at. Gave it to my nephew and I take photos of him every time my sister would suck this into his mouth.
this is an excellent kit to use with the pump.  the cooler bag fits perfectly in the pump bag and the bottles are just the right size.  great purchase!
"super soft, arrived quickly and exactly what i wanted."
awesome product!!!
"very nice step stool.  small and short, not as tall as a regular step stool.  made of bamboo, arrived fully assembled.  i bought a bed that is taller than i'm used to, so i got this for a foot stool next to the bed.  perfect for my use. one other thing is that it is fairly narrow as far as width goes. my relatively small size six and a half feet do not fit fully on the stool's width, but i don't need them too. if you need a stool that your foot fits on completely this might not be the one for you."
kids love to flush this potty
has been great for nap time at school. very durable!
this works perfect for me to put my purse on the stroller
"love it,  now my whole house doesn't vibrate when my four year old shuts the door :)"
"i love, love, love. this was a great buy for my now 7 month old who is a bit on the chunky side. it is very spacious giving her plenty of room to roll around and play with her toys. easy to put together and break down which is a great plus and the travel bag is awesome. my only thumbs down is just i wish the padding was a little bit thicker. my daughter likes to kick and sometimes i think she may hurt her little feet on the firm bottom."
arrived as described. have had it for about a week and it's been great. i sprayed a little window cleaner on the suction cups before sticking them to the tub and so far no issues with it falling down.
it removes the hassle and hurt of pumping.  worth every penny!
i love my daughter bag it was worth the money. and perfect timing. great product.
great diaper bag for &#34;dad&#34; to carry
"these work well and stay in place. they are visually very nice as well and look classy, unlike the plastic ones."
loved these
perfect for a little boy's trips to nana's.  the quality is fine and it is really cute.
"these are by far the best breast milk storage bags. they can only hold up to 6 ounces, but the pour spout it has its a miracle. it is so easy to pour the milk into a bottle. i love them."
"i love this playpen! it is sturdy enough for my toddler and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a good playpen! my only wish is that it was a little cheaper, but other than that, i would definitely buy it again!"
exactly what i needed
"My guy loved his Cowie. The pacifier is very firmly attached and all the features are baby safe. Some people complain that it is smaller and lighter than they were expecting, but I considered that a plus and felt safe letting it sit on my newborn's chest. Unlike the other pacifier holders, the wubbunub is made of a velvety material. I put the whole thing in a lingerie bag and ran it through the wash; by the end of the spin cycle, it was always dry enough to hand back to the baby. The only downside is that once the pacifier is broken, the whole thing is done for. My guy chewed through the new one in less than 2 months."
"My LO has been using these from since she was 1 month old, and she still loves them now that she's 9 months old. The entire pacifier is very flexible and rubbery unlike the traditional plastic backed ones, which means that she also loves to gnaw on it when she's teething. It's also a cinch to clean, rinse it out and microwave it along with all the bottles and things, we literally have 10 of them for her to use throughout the day."
I loved it.
"This is my go-to baby shower gift. I HIGHLY recommend. When my oldest was born, we went through a new pacifier almost weekly because he lost them all over the house, car, and grocery store. Not with the Wubba! The best part about it is how easily kids are able to find it. It doesn't fall to the bottom of the carseat on road trips and he never wakes up crying in the middle of the night because it's lost. We've had the same two since he was born. I throw them in the wash weekly, dryer and all, and they're like new. After 12 months, it is showing slight wear where the nook is sewn to the plush. I wish Wubbanub would come out with a new line of plushes attached to the blue pacifiers for slightly older babies."
Our baby loves it. So far no complains.
I bought this for my baby nephews for christmas with a toxedo. He looked really cute with it. It was a good laugh.
My niece is enjoying it.
"I have  had excellent experienced with multiple wub a nubs. Bought several for each of my kids as babies ( replacements and extras!) Easy to keep track of, unlike a small regular pacifier. Plus in the crib older babies can find it and less crying for pacis at night. When our oldest got too big for it we simply cut off the pacifier. She still sleeps with the animal. I buy these for friends having new babies. They are easy to throw in the washer as well and hold up nicely."
Best gift for a Green Bay Fan that is having a girl.
This pacifier and the other one almost like it are great baby stop making sounds in seconds!
perfect. exactly what I was expecting :)
Very high quality product!
Love these!<br />Bought these for my 13 year old years ago. Decided to use the exact pacifier for the new baby. Since my oldest loved them so much. Not to mention they are SUPER cute. Shipping was FAST. Order on February 22nd got it on the 25th. Thank you.
"Only pacifiers my baby likes, just wish there was more of a selection"
this one should work. It's cute. It's easy to find when set down. It's soft and washable. It's made from high quality material.
Great
We LOVE these pacifiers.  My son has used them for a while and they truly glow all night.  Simply hold them up to a light before bedtime for about 10 seconds and you can find them in the dark all night.  I needed some replacement ones as our old one wore out.  I was having trouble finding retailers that carried them an ordered this set on line.  The only CON is that these are almost twice the price of the ones I ended up finding in a local baby chain store in town.
"My daughter loves these! You can prop it against something so it stays in her mouth better, and she loves holding onto the stuffed animal part :)"
Ok
These are really great for a mustache themed party. They also fit on a baby pacifier.
"An excellent choice for our son. We have tried a few different brands of pacifiers but none stayed in our son's mouth for more than a minute. Once we received your product and sterilized it, our son immediately loved it!<br />Thank you"
Love this
"My 4 month old can get these binkies in and out of his mouth on his own due to the design. If he drops this one, he can find it and put it back in his mouth on his own. Worth every cent. Love these!"
"These are the absolute BEST pacifiers out there for babies and toddlers.  My son was an early teether (first tooth at 8 weeks) and he found great comfort in teething on this pacifier and pacifier edge.  They are high quality and last a while, but I replace them when I see stress marks for safety.  They do bounce if they fall on the floor but it isn't a big deal in the two years we've been using them.  I like that they are natural rubber but have had the latex allergy component removed from it so there is no risk of developing a latex allergy just from repeated use of them.  I wish they made a baby bottle nipple, I searched high and low but doesn't seem this company makes baby bottle nipples.  I've found rubber ones but they contain latex and I'm not comfortable with that. So, we had to go with silicone and my son detested the texture."
hahaha great gift for my baby niece
I am extremely satisfied with this purchase! These glow in the dark pacifiers have really made my life as a new Mom a lot easier. My son would wake up in the middle of the night because he was looking for his pacifier in his crib. Now when he wakes up he is able to see the pacifier and grab it since it glows in the dark. I would recommend these to any parent whose baby uses a pacifier during the night.
brand new great nephew seemed to like this
Good price. Cute Colors.
These glow in the dark for quite some time. Can't give you an exact. It's great when trying to get them down at night. :)
"We love it!!!!  Our daughter is 5 weeks old. She hates most pacifiers. Really hate the soothies, and orthodontic shaped pacifiers. She would only take the mam style. She is breastfed only. If you have a similar baby they may like this. She latched onto this paci after about 10 seconds."
"We received these as a baby shower gift, a novelty really, but we used them for our son when he was about a month old and he loved them. The ridging/bumps along the gum line were an instant soother and he's refused every single other kind of binky since.<br /><br />I've since ordered tons of these to fill his crib and have extras throughout the house.<br /><br />We don't leave home without them and wouldn't dream of running out. We are now loyal Baby Fanatic pacifier customers."
"At first I used the MAM newborn pacifiers which my daughter also loved, since about 6 weeks we have started using these. They are very cute and she loves them. I have tried others and she won't take them. Some people don't like to give these to their babies, but it is reccomended now to give at bedtime to reduce risk for SIDS. So glad I chose these, they're great."
"Bought this for my new grandbaby,they get a lot of use out of it,It is such a good idea,"
These work the best for my babies. I breastfed and thus brand was the only ones they would take. They didn't experience nipple confusion either.
My son don't like pacifiers but he sucks this one. Good product
Daughter loved it.
Son loves his binky good price no problem's.
"Probably one of the best, important buys of my life!!!! My child ADORED this bo-bo because of the fit. He wouldn't take any other bo-bo so I had to replace this several times! In addition, it was a show stopper for sure lol!"
these are really great--  just remember smallest ones are really small (perfect for tiny mouth babies & very new infants) & eventually may need the larger one or baby keeps popping it outta their mouth!  first tried MAM when other pacifiers were too long & gagged baby... these were perfect!
Newborn baby loves these. Much easier to hold and manipulate than pacifiers that have a moving handle.
Perfect gift for anyone who is whiney.
"Good quality, I like the material you can clean easily!"
Came in good condition and exactly what we expected
Great product! Contoured tip fits great and comfortably into my sons mouth. Have tried multiple types of pacifiers and this is the only type my son will tolerate.
If you are a new mom and contemplating what to put on your registry or what to buy.  BUY THIS. I would put this in my top 10 things I use the most as a mom. The Avant Soothie is a great brand pacifier and since it is attached to a stuffed animal you won't lose it and they don't pop out of their mouth as easily since your baby can maneuver the animal easier that it is bigger. This one is better than the elephant we don't like that one cause the trunk makes is longer and makes it harder for baby to manipulate. Seriously best thing ever.
I had bought a dragon for my son so I decided to get this owl for a friends baby due in march. Slightly bigger than the dragon my son has but its all the same really. Perfect as a toy and soother. I've heard many good things about this product and I recommend to everyone.
Love these!  Go Tigers!
Never a problem with MAM! I especially love how open these are. Help keep the area around the mouth from breaking out as bad with all those slobbers!
"Mr Monkey as we call him, has been one of the best investments that we've made since our daughter was born. We got our first one even our daughter was 4 months old and we haven't looked back even though she is now 17 months and well past the she listing on the package. Mr Monkey helped our daughter learn to self soothe early on as it was easier for her to find in the dark of her crib at night and even before she could figure out how to get the pacifier back in her mouth she was at least able to pull his foot or arm up to her face and that seemed to calm her. We've glove through a few of them now that she has most of her teeth but it's well worth buying replacements as her monkey still is her favorite soother. When she's fussy we just ask her to go adds find Mr Monkey and that usually does the trick to calm her down.<br /><br />For those with concerns about keeping it clean, I just throw the whole thing in the washer (we also have the giraffe version of this so we always have one available while the other is being washed). When it comes out of the dryer I just hand wash the pacifier part to rid it of any fuzz or residue and there you have it, a fresh clean wubbanub. ;-)"
"It's a pacifier and it works. Easy to clean, fits her ulubulu paci clip."
Great for an Auburn baby!
great price for a necessary product
love love love must buy! i put a thick clear tape over the speaker to lower the volume (there are no volume controls) - this lasts and lasts and my baby is no longer fussy in bed (the old wind up mobile would stop after a 2 minutes just as she was starting to enjoy it)- this is a great buy
a perfect toy for the car seat. i don't have to worry about toys falling out of his seat. he bats at the toys and they make sounds and play music. easy money spent.
covers so much more then the smaller types. i feel much safer in the shower since the rubber mat covers so much of the tub bottom. it was heavier then i expected but that is because it is a decent quality. it sticks well to the tub like it should and lays flat easily. i had wanted one in a prettier color but i'm glad i changed my mind and got this one i think it will last a long time.
i could not live without this! keeps diapers and wipes neat inside the diaper bag and is easy to grab while on the go. i love the print on the inside and it is very easy to clean.
i've been using it for a month and so far i have no problem with it. comfortable and absorbing well. great product!
we used these at a baby shower to give the mom-to-be handmade personalized bibs for her baby.  she loved them.
love these bottles!
these cups have consistently been the only ones that last without leaking that we have found! they are great and inexpensive!
love super soft
used these to announce our pregnancy to our parents on xmas eve.  total hit! this was the perfect way to tell our family.  highly recommend.
cute and practical
great product
"the product works, my wife and i are happy with it. we took our new born son out in chicago, weather was around 35f to 40f that day, we did not have any problem. we put him in the car seat with the appropriate warm clothing and cover him with a fleece blanket, and push him in around in the stroller with the car seat attached.<br /><br />when we take him out from the car seat, after 20 mins outside the street (not in the car); we can feel that it was very warm inside warm the car seat with this cover."
"fits the &#34;mattress&#34; well, nice and snugly."
purchased these in addition to the paytex drop in bottles as my son was too young to use the medium flow nipples yet. they work great! love these bottles also.
"i looooooooooove this stroller!!!! my son was so excited. very light and comfortable for him. perfect to go to the park, mall store even for travel. its the perfect size."
"good for holding diaper prefolds in the correct shape and freeing hands to handle the diaper covers. saved a lot of time, especially with wiggly kids."
fabulous
"love, love, love this car seat transporter! i purchased this for my trip to disney february 2015 and i breezed through the airport. i received so many stares and compliments and people asking me where i got it. it is easy to attach to a large car seat as i have the chicco a next fit, and you just pop open the wheels, loop the straps around the car seat and pull the handle up and you're on your way. so glad i got this. they didn't even make me remove it while it went through the security scanners like others mentioned. however, we were fine with reattaching it as we just needed to get our baby's car seat and the baby on move."
All babies love this
Great
Very cute however I dont like how the binki doesn't detach like the store ones.
My grandson loved it
My baby loves these!  bought more to keep around the house and in the baby bag!  Well made and in one piece.  no plastic smell.
So cute and soft!!! My daughter will not take any other pacifier. The wubbabub helps from paci falling out!
Very cute
Love this pacifier
"Great product! Easy clean up, babies love the shape and texture, long lasting. Bought like 15 of these."
Great price
perfect
"i wish i found this teether sooner, it's perfect. i love how small it is, easy to clean, and my baby loves it. also, the price is good too."
washed and dryed nicely.  fabric is soft and it did not shrink.
item was exactly as described and shipping was prompt. very simple design with solid pieces so nothing can fall off or become dislodged. highly reecomended!
perfect
"so cute, great service. thank you"
love these! so much more absorbent than other brands i have tried.  they are also relatively comfortable.  i wear them all day and even through the night and only have to change once.
easy to use and super fun colors!  easy to clean too.
"great system, bought it for my son and daughter in law and hope it holds up well for them"
perfect for my toddler.  it matches our adult set.
a classy bag worth every penny!
"why didn't i know about this earlier? i saw this in a baby store and thought it was a great idea. my six month old wasn't sitting up on her own yet and i was needing to start bathing her with her sister to save time. this allowed her to sit up and play in the water. it took up about 1/3 of our tub which allowed her sister the rest of the tub to play in. it's super soft.<br /><br />this item is rather heavy when wet. we let it sit in the tub after it completing drains and then hang it up. also, if you fill the tub too high, it kinda floats and ends up as a baby boat!"
"a temporary need, but the travel my brest friend was wonderful for the first 5 months of my baby's life. meant we could go out and i wouldn't have to worry about how to hold up my baby to feed."
"got one as a gift and my daughter loved them so much, i bought two others.  they are truly comfortable and work as a little easy swaddler for older kids.  wish i'd had them with my first child!  love them!"
good quality product
love them
my toddler daughter loves her new pillow.  she gets excited to go to bed when she sees her pillow in her crib.  this pillow fits perfect in the crib and for her little head.
absolute must
these were an absolute lifesaver when breast feeding my second baby.  she had latch problems and i would not have continued breast feeding if the lactation consultant hadn't given me one.  now that i am pregnant for my third this was one of the first things i ordered to prepare!  great product would recommend to anyone!
"similar to an italian made chico pram we had more than 10 years ago, everything looks great and we love the flexibility."
looks great on my daughters bed.
great product with some peace of mind at bedtime!
"i pirchased this decal almost two years ago and, i have to say that they are still lovely.<br />very on place as well very easy to put on."
absolutely perfect! we got this for my one year old daughter for her first birthday and she loves it so much we bought a second one for our almost four year old really durable would recommend to other mothers!
as soon as i gave it to my baby girl she loved it! thanks baby banana!
"i've tried several brands and these are by far my favorite. they feel amazing, wash up like new & i've never had 1 leak (unlike others). for the price it's silly not to try them. i don't think you'll be disappointed."
"How freaking cute is this dragon?! I had seen the dogs and cats and bears, but I wanted something a little more interesting. What is most awesome is that he has had this type of paci since being in the hospital so he loves the paci iand the dragon. He gets excited every time we pull this out, and he loves to suck on the tail."
My friends baby will look so cute when sucking on this!
great product. mixes well. baby loves it!
"beautiful and well made! it fit my daughter, who was 4 1/2 months old at the time, comfortably without leaving marks. perfect for christmas!"
my 4 month old absolutely loves this!!! we have many toys for her and this one is our favorite! she can jump on her own vs not being able to scoot across the floor in the other toys yet. we love it!!!!
"my poor baby is cutting 4 teeth on top; this teether really helps with the soreness in her gums. it's her favorite, by far."
"amazing product, color is vibrant, soft but durable material."
so far my breastfed baby will take this bottle.  i never found a bottle that my first son would take.
snug fit. make sure it fits your brand
this product is great and saves lots of time in the kitchen<br />totally recomended
always a great gift!
"i used this the other day at the mall. my 1 year old is sick right now and only wants to be held. this worked great. he's is a 25 ounder and this definately held him up and released a lot of pressure and discomfort from my wrists. if worn properly its very comfortable. i thought it would hurt my shoulder with the wait, but it didn't. i just need to learn or practice putting it on. for a first timer i struggled a bit just to get it straight and to figure out how to put it on so that the rings wouldn't hurt him. also the rings are metal-super sturdy. this was a great invenstment. i just wonder why i took so long to get one. took me a while to find one that would last a while sense my kiddo is not an infant anymore. this is a perfect item to get if your baby isn't so much a baby anymore. recommend!!!"
this video baby monitor is awesome. great picture day or night. pretty good range. nice zoom feature and you can move the camera all around. lets you talk to the baby and even play 3 different lullabies. great price for the quality. i would definitely recommend this camera to new parents.
so cute!
great grandbaby loves it!
perfect fit. nice and sturdy.  as advertised
i bought these to have extra...a little pricey but a great product.
love this! perfect for traveling or putting in your bed. my baby used this from 3 to 6 months and got use to it so much that when i transitioned her to her crib she wouldn't sleep. we went on two vacations and she slept in it fine.
"quick shipping, easy to assemble. looks like great fun"
"i thought it might be too thin, but is is awesome. a bit more generous in cut than the official stokke sheet, easier to put on because it's very slightly stretchy, and much much much softer. i try to wash this and get it back on the bed rather than using my other cotton stokke sheet. i have 2 now and will probably get more. no issues with fading or losing their shape, though i've only had them a few months so far."
"this is such an awesome thing to have during potty training!  brilliant, diono.  it is super easy to install and fits the carseat perfectly."
got it to use for air for my dog to keep her cooler in the summer works good.
love it
this is the best system ever!!!!!
this product is a life saver. our little girl had trouble settling down to sleep she would either cry herself to sleep or have to sleep on moms breast.<br />she also was a colic baby and the the dr. recommended this product she said and i agree that it is good to keep her at an angle. also that it is like a hammock and keeps the baby wrapped tight. so if you swaddle her with a blanket and then put her in it keeps her nice and snuggled. it really worked and she has slept in it ever since. first in our room then moved to her own room for our peace and quiet. the only negative is that she didn't like the vibration but that may be just her. also with a newborn i removed the rattle and wish i could remove the straps. the baby is in there nice and tight it wasn't really necessary to strap them in. also the rocking is very helpful and it is very easy to rock.
"one of the cheapest on the market, and of good quality, especially for a kid!"
"i had purchased the medela disposables... after i ran out of those, i ordered these because the price was lower... turns out these are wayyy more comfortable, absorbent, and look better in my purse than any other brands i've tried."
Amazing!
Best pacifiers you can get for breastfeeding babies. We haven't had any issues with nipple confussion. We love thay thay come in sterilizing boxes. These are the only pacifiers my baby will take and it has not affected his willingness or desire to breastfeed.
My daughter is exclusively breastfeed and these don't affect her feedings. We love them and everyone loves how cute they are.
perfect for my boy
"These bottles are amazing. My baby was exclussively breastfed until 3 months, when I had to return to work. I was very worried because I have heard from other moms that their babies did not want to breastfeed after introducing bottlefeeding. We tried Avent and Nuk and he woudn't drink out of these. The MAM bottles have not caused nipple confussion. He is now 6 months old and he still breastfeeds when I am at home and bottlefeeds while I'm at work. The only issue we have had is that if you are not careful when assembling them, they may leak when warming up the bottle. Just take your time when putting the bottles together; make sure they are assembled tightly and correctly and this will not happen."
"My daughter loves her wubba nubs. I am going to have an all out war to get her to give them up. They are great as they are not so easily lost like a plain pacifier, but your child will imprint on these and clutch it constantly for comfort and love. This little elephant is particularly cute. Another favorite is the dragon style."
I love tommee tippee brand and their pacifiers hold up very well to my expectations! They don't glow very well in the dark but that's not why I bought them. I bought them because we were using the tommee tippee bottles and she would no longer take the hospital pacifiers. Amazon is one of the best prices and love that we get two day free shipping with prime especially since I can't find the size we need in any stores.
"Newborn loved these, she's one month old now and still only wants these."
the MAM Air Silicone Pacifier are very good ..
Love them very fast shipping
"Wubbanubs as a whole are wonderful. My granddaughter can manipulate them fairly well at 6 weeks. FYI that the confetti puppy is a little fatter/rounder than the giraffe and pink bear, so it does not stay placed as well as the giraffe and pink bear due to its top heaviness. On a whole, these have been very helpful!"
Molded from a single piece of rubber makes these easy to wash and sterilize.
Thank you so much it's just what I wanted it actually came earlier than expected which was great thank you again I will definitely be purchasing more from this seller.
cute! my toddler loves this in the tub.
baby loves this.  she is able to grab and shake on her own.
love these bottles my grandson took to these with no problems.
fantastic!!! he's a tall kid and pulls himself up on everything but this still contains him! i love the gate piece too!
good
"my son loves it, a much better option than my small metal necklace"
"this is perfect for booster seats because there's no back. the texture reminds me of a floor mat that is just rubber. it will be so easy to clean.<br />for car seats with backs, i recommend the brica seat guardian because it protects the whole seat. http://www.amazon.com/brica-seat-guardian-car-protector/dp/b00b7m7bkw/ref=pd_sbs_ba_2?ie=utf8&refrid=1bqj37yscthaxg8c6cs4"
i bought these for my 6 month old and she took to them right away. will purchase these again.
we've had these bed rails for 4 years and still going strong.
"the side zipper can be somewhat awkward to zip and unzip but otherwise this is a perfect hoodie! i have been wearing it in addition to my winter coat here in chicago, makes me feel like baby stays warmer since i don't have a coat big enough to zip around her. i know this will be perfect on it's own on the cooler spring and fall days too. worth every penny!"
too cute.
my 3 year old loves this because now he can go to the bathroom like daddy!
perfect size and shape for a changing pad  the strap kinda gets in the way  and you will more than likely never use it
perfect backpack for a toddler to carry.
"this thing is a god send. from infancy, both my children responded well to white noise for sleeping, and it helped save many a night of sleep for us. now that my youngest is a toddler, we still use the white noise (we use the ocean one), which helps drown out any sounds we may be making in the living room (tv, vacuum, etc.) when he goes to bed. we also use the projector part as a nightlight. we bought this one because it plugs in. we had one before that used batteries and it ate through them so fast, and then we used our phones, but it would run down the battery and someone would call in the middle of its use and wake the baby, so having one that plugs in and is separate from our phones was imperative. i can't say enough good things about this product. it saved our sanity during our baby's first year and beyond."
love love love these cards! wish i had known earlier about them
very good
my 17 month old loves her new sippy cups!
"i bought this for my premature sons crib, it is perfect. babies should not have soft mattresses. i recieved the product on time and it had no smell to it. it is firm but not uncomfortably firm. my baby is 6 months old now and likes the mattress, it is sturdy and good construction and will last a while. i am happy i bought it and will recommend it."
excellent
"the suction cups work on smooth surfaces, my wall is bumpy so i used velcro instead. the size is perfect for toddlers (not sure why so many people say it is too small, mine is accurate to the picture) and my 3 year old loves his new potty so much he used it before i could put it on the wall haha made me hold it because he was too excited to wait!! so happy i bought this! wish there was an option like this for girls! ;)"
"love it, is very soft and has alot of air cushion. fits perfect with our quinny buzz xtra stoller. can't wait for our baby to use it!"
I purchased this bear for a friend whose granddaughter had a baby who was not sleeping. The sound of this bear sounds very much like the womb sound. The bear is very well made and a nice size. The baby isn't sleeping much better but this doesn't mean that another baby would react much differently.
These WubbaNubs are like crack to my daughter. They are easy for little hands to grab onto and when they get dirty I throw them in the washer. They wash great. I've even stitched a new pacifier into one when it got wore out.
My nephew looks adorable with this pacifier!
Adorable! Received them so quickly A++++
Best pacis out there
Funny binky
Another great Avend product!
funny for the baby
Perfect. Love these cant live without them
My son took very well to these pacifiers.
"We LOVE LOVE LOVE our elephant, can't go to bed without this thing!!!!"
"Fast shipping, exactly as expected"
The best
Excellent!!!
"These are the same pacifiers my son was given in the hospital, and he would not take any other kind of pacifier. I only wish they were a little easier to put a pacifier clip on, because they bounce when dropped (or thrown across the room by an 8 month old)."
Thanks
very good product
perfect baby gift every time
Great product
All good. No complains. Vendor delivered fast
All good. No complains. Vendor delivered fast
Super soft and just what we needed
Great. You can see them in the dark!
I got these for my niece since my dog ate one of hers and she liked it.
Excellent
Got it on time and love it. we used them in some of his pic.s all so.
Love this!
My little girl loves these! It was the only bottle she would take out of about 5 other brands we tried. It is the closest thing to the real deal I have found. Highly recommend to anyone who is having to supplement their breast milk it doesn't seem to cause nipple confusion like others do. My little one can switch from breast to bottle with no problem. I can't give more than 5 stars but I'd like to! Love love love this product!! Oh and bonus having the binkies! My baby girl wouldn't take any other binky not even the ones they give at the hospital but she takes these and it has allowed this mamma extra sleep!
"Perfect for my grandson.  The nice thing about these is that they are easy for a little one to grab and find, especially when they wake at night."
"My daughter used these up to 3 months! Absolutely loved them; just hard to keep them in the baby's mouth. Besides that frustration if trying to keep the bink in the mouth, excellent product!"
"When my baby was about a month old, I got her this because she loves to spit her binky out constantly. I figured with it being &#34;weighted&#34; that it would help some. It did. And it was so cute to see her snuggled up to him, even out of her mouth. (Him because my husband named him 'Geoffrey' like the Toys'R'Us giraffe). We don't use it as much now that she's almost 4 months old."
Love them
"These pacifiers are great. The best part is that if my son drops it when sleeping, he won't get a mark on his face if he accidently sleeps on it. He also doesn't get that ring around his mouth from sucking to hard like other pacifiers.  Plus I like think its cute to see the little hole in his mouth when he sucks. It's also super easy to throw in the hot water to sterlize."
So cute
I love seeing these pacifiers at night in the dark!
Newborns favorite!
Purchased as a baby shower gift. Used for one of the games then gave to mommy. Great item for both game and gift.
Perfect for newborns
New grand-baby on way
Love it
Love
Great buy! thank you
Excellent for sterilization and drying
"my son loves it, great service"
"i hate to admit it, but i have a baby fetish. i like to suck on a pacifier, etc. pretty harmless. tis pacifier is well made. i think it could be a lot better - thesurrounding plastic part is horizontal, to the face and lips. i think if it were curved, to fit the shape of the lips, it would be much better. there are many nerve endings o the lips and face. if the pacifier were curved, it would simulate the face and lips more.  i look forward to $5,000 for product design.. john/honolulu"
So cute
"As Anyone would know These are Essential for a Newborn or infant. These were made with a Good design,  Baby Proven!! I would recommend this product..."
So pretty and cute. Baby seems to enjoy them. Avent stands for quality.
ALL OK
"Great all in one. Pacifer, teether, and its WASHABLE. All of it! She loves to chew on tbe legs and the antlers. I dont worry about the beans coming out bc they are sown into their own little compartment. We have a different Wub for each diaper bag and the crib. Most of the time she just likes to hold onto it. Thanks for this product!"
Just...omg my niece looks hilarious with this. Lots of curious looks from people!! But my niece loves it!! Definitely will purchase again!!
"Perfect for our preemie! The little bit of weight of the monkey helped him keep the pacifier in when he couldn't do it on his own, and gave him something to cuddle as he drifted off...made transitioning him from breastfeeding to pacifier easy too as he had something to hold after he snuggled with mommy."
By far the best pacifiers we have used!
My baby loved it!!
A+++great item and love it!
Perfect bo bo's would love to order more in the future!!!!!
"Daughter loves the bug! We bring it everywhere, & she now chews on the legs...what ever keeps her happy!"
"My son loves these and after taking his bottle away at 1 year, these were the only thing that saved us at night time! They are strong, perfect for little fingers! Most definitely soothing!"
Wonderful product for a great price.
Excellent
Love our wubbanubs! She played with them and didn't suck on them after we ordered more but the first one she had that we lost was awesome! Definitely recommend
We LOVE Wubbanub's this is a cute holiday one that can be use year round. They keep the paci in the babies mouth and give them something to hold ob to. Best baby shower gift ever!
Love these pacifiers! Easy to clean. Good quality.
"This was a gift, shipped to another address. Recipient love it, but I didn't get to see it in person,"
"I ordered this for my baby before he was born...turns out he won't take a pacifier.  But this is really cute!!!!  Love it, wish he would take it."
Love love love these but wish it was available in the 3+ month as well
Easy for the little ones to hold. Our little one loves it.
"My little one doesn't take Soothie pacifiers but I actually tore it out and sewed it my adapter for MAMS pacifier, and she loves it! It's the perfect size not to big not to small. Also gave me a shipping day of feb 9th and got here on the 6th ! Super nice!"
Keeps pacidiers handy. Fits 2 soothie pacidiers. I've had this for several months now and the Velcro is still strong (unlike some other reviews).
Handy and a must! Will purchase again. No sticky residue and baby doesn't mind taste.
Absolutely love this little wub.  It has texture on the paws and it is just precious!
Good
Bought these Wubs as shower gifts.  My grandson loved his and they are so much easier for babies to grasp!
best pacifier
"Love our lil tiger WubbaNub! These lil cuties are easy for baby to handle, are machine washable, and not easily lost. Big thanks to the Kaiser NICU nurse that gave us our first one. We totally love them - so much so that we now have 5 of them, actually. :D"
Good product!
We received a TT pacifier in a bottle set that someone bought us. We tried the pacifier  and baby enjoyed it enough that we invested in more for daycare!
"Mainly bought these because my daughter's husband and my son's wife are Patriots fans.  They're nicely made and just a typical pacifier.  If you're a fan and want a novel item for the baby, this is cute to have."
good
"Great for carrying pacifiers in, though I wish it were a bit bigger to carry a few."
Perfect.
"If you need a laugh,you need to purchase this for some little baby. We bought this as a joke for our great-granddaughter and she looks so adorable in it in her mouth. We laughed and laughed. Our baby surely liked this 'binky' because she used it a lot. It was very entertaining to watch the reactions of people when they first saw her with it in her mouth. It is well worth the money just for the laughs. I loved it."
I don't know what we would do without our wubbanub! Great product!
The stuffie is wonderfully made And my sweet girl looks adorable with it and genuinely seems to like it! I recommend it and am ordering a second these rock!!! :) Very happy momma!
"Came just as advertised. With these pacifiers I have had times where I get different images on the MAM pacifiers than have been shown on the product page images, but this one was accurate. We love MAM pacifiers. They are all we buy for our babies."
Very well made and perfect for car rides.  I can give it to my baby and not worry about him losing it.
Too cute.
love this product
Love these paci's! They really work...hold them in front of a light for a few seconds before putting them in the crib an they stay lit for most of the night. My daughter is able to find them in the middle of the night instead of crying for me to get it for her!
"Cheapest Price On The Net!! Your child will sleep through the night, guaranteed!! LOVE THESE!!!"
Too cute.
Love the wubbs
Love
Wonderful baby gift.
My bady loved her passy its very funny and well made
We have had three kids who all loved Soothie binkies more than any other. I love that they are one piece and all silicone so it is easy to boil them to disinfect.
Very good
Came exactly as described with a nice clasp that closes well.
Very very good
"These were very cute and well-made.  My son still never took a paci - he just looked up at me like, &#34;where's the milk, mom?&#34;  Overall though as a product these are adorable and well-made though."
Grandson loved it! Great quality
My order of the amber teething necklace was shipped quickly. It was packaged in a beautiful bag and the necklace is high-quality. I would definitely recommend this seller and product to anyone.
"It's cute, durable, and a great space saver."
"After an extensive amount of time (most would consider it overkill) researching lightweight strollers, I decided on this one. We needed a stroller that would travel well without sacrificing all features, like most umbrella strollers. Our usual stroller is a Britax b ready, so this is a huge difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Assembly was easy- all wheels come unattached, as well as the umbrella.<br />The recline option is easy to work, no different really than tightening the bottom of a coat.<br />Handles are comfortable to hold and seem to be a perfect height (5'8&#34;). I suspect others that will use it that are much taller will be comfortable as well.<br />The cup holder! There is a storage sack/built in cup holder affixed to the top<br />Large umbrella with matching dot trim covers significant area<br />Storage basket seems large enough to hold a diaper bag and coat<br /><br />No Cons as of yet.<br /><br />I second that this is the same as the Ignite stroller by the First Years. I gave significant consideration to purchasing that instead, but the brand is really a moot point for this to me. The product registration form even references that this is an Ignite model. Price point was about $15 less to go with this model vs the Ignite.<br /><br />Lastly, the colors are much more muted than pictured- I was concerned that the stroller looked girly, but honestly the colors are gender neutral. Highly recommend."
we baught this after useing pockets for a long time and wanted a all in one for our daughter i love how easy they are to put on and take off the only thing i didnt like that as with any all in one it takes forever to dry unless you dry them in a dryer which i dont. Also these diapers will fit both small and chubby babys but im not sure if id call them one size as my daughters one (21lb)  and still fits this with it snaped all the way in and down
Item exactly as described. Easy to use. Fast delivery
Got this for our grandson. When he gets bigger it will be great.
"The screen is nice and large, the image is much clearer than others I've had and the range of motion for the camera is great. I'm not sure you can beat it for the price. My sister has a different brand, a very common one, that is around $100 and it can't compare to the quality and functionality of this one. I'm so happy we got this."
"I love this paci. Well, actually it's my baby who loves it and he only take this paci.<br />The only con is that it's hard to sterilize. Other then that it's good product."
Love this was great for airport.
Bought as a gift an the mom was Happy!
This was the best purchase. My husband and I live in a hot humid (mosquito driven) area and this product works great. We are also marathon runners and needed a cover that didn't flap around when we take my sons car seat in the jogging stroller. It also protects when the sun is at different angles. We have a graco snug ride 35 car seat and this fits perfectly. My only wish is that it came in more styles and colors.
Great screen protectors.  Arrived when promised.
"The feeder is just the right size for the baby mouth, easy for him to hold. The silicone food pouch maintains it's shape even when not full and does not flop around like mesh feeders do. The holes are just big enough for tiny food pieces to go through without the danger of choking. It's perfect for meet, fruit and veggies. My son likes to drop everything on the floor so the clip or very handy."
Coordinates perfectly!
We love Graco car seats. Keeps my almost 3 year old snug and safe. Has been washed a couple of times and still looks brand new.
Keeps baby warm and safe.  Fit is large.
"have 2 under 2 and this allows me to keep an eye on both of them! So thankful for this monitor! Has great range too, we can grill on the patio in the back at night or during the weekend when the girls are napping, and can see them in crystal clear definition."
"Great price and love this dresser, very sturdy and quick shipping."
"This is a lot easier for my son to learn than a sipping cup.  It took him 30 seconds to learn how to use a straw, which is totally amazing for me.  The straw inside can be detached easily for cleaning.  There is not many hard to reach places where I cannot clean in case of mold growth.  My son has been chewing on the straw but there is no teeth marks."
"I got the green!  It really is cut and I love it.  No patterns/cartoon characters.  I almost got the black and I'm so glad  didn't!  Chair is easy to fold/unfold although it is quite bulky.  Wipes clean.  The tray is not adjustable as others have mentioned, but that's not really a big deal for me.  Babies are messy so no matter how the tray fits, they're still going to drop stuff.  My baby is 8.5 months old about 16lbs, so she's pretty small.  So, I don't need to swing the tray open to put her in, yet.  There's plenty of room to climb out/stand, so be sure to strap 'em in!"
Great fabric that really keeps the drool in. They look so adorable on!
"This is a great crib for the price.  There are 3 height adjustments, but you do have to remove the mattress (mattress not included) and take out the bolts with nuts on each corner to be able to change the height.  We just set ours to the lowest adjustment for a 1 year old which has worked out just fine.  The crib is very sturdy and feels very safe for the baby."
"We have had this for almost seven years and even though we no longer need it for what it is, it is still awesome. My husband has actually just recently made it into a bookshelf on wheels."
Love them!
very good!
Daughter loves this since mommy uses one too! She carries her baby dolls and stuff animals. :)
Holds 2 pacifiers perfectly.
"Different color, but works great!"
Works great for Grandkids room.
"These are great for on the go healthy snacks. I was buying the brand name fruit pouches but realized how much money if save making them myself! I'm happy I found these little green pouches, my son loves the homemade apple sauce I make him!"
"I ordered the toddler pillow for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas based on the positive reviews on Amazon.com. My daughter was thrilled at the idea of having a pillow, but said that it was too puffy. Soon after we received the pillow, I got a very nice email from Chris at Little Sleepy Head Pillows asking how my daughter liked the pillow.  When I told Chris my daughter's feedback, he graciously offered to send a custom &#34;less fill&#34; pillow.  The new pillow arrived within days.  The &#34;less fill&#34; pillow works great for my daughter. She says it is comfortable and loves it.  I really liked the great customer service from a small family run company."
"Great reception, Great battery charge too can go all night without being plugged in so i can wear it on my bely withe clip on!"
Stays secure for my toddler grandkids. I also like that it hangs up on the side of the toilet.
"Super cute, soft, and functional"
My daughter loved this pillow. Very soft and cuddly!
Nice
"Easy, out-of-the-box installation.  I found it easy to figure out how to move panels, as well as connect two sets. We are using this to cordon off half of the patio to separate a play area for an infant from the pool. Very nice looking, and solid build. Absolutely a great product. Thanks!"
The best thing I have bought for my baby. I have used this masher bowl every single day since my turned 6 months! Absolutely love it!
Love this chair. Easy to assemble. Convenient. Tons of compliment from non-parents about how cool the chair is when we are at a restaurant.
Ridiculously adorable.
My daughter absolutely loves these.  It's great to have multiples on hand so one can be chilling while she chews on another.
LOVE this. So cute and girly.
"Transitioned to this from sippy cup when son was 10.5 months old. He was able to drink from it immediately and learn that he didn't have to turn it upside down to drink. The only time it leaks is when it's assembled incorrectly. Handles are great, glass insert is awesome, he loves it and I'm happy that we're out of sippy cups and moving forward. He drinks water and OJ (with pulp, no problem) in it now. I'm going to buy another one to start putting his whole milk in at 1 year. It gets a little foggy between the glass and plastic but as long as I'm wash it regularly, I see it as just a cosmetic issue that is unavoidable but doesn't deter me from buying a second cup."
"Quality material, matches the leather in my new Ford Explorer beautifully, and I am no longer standing on my head on the floor of my vehicle to retrieve the items that I used to lose beside the seat!  Loved this product so much I bought a set for each of my kid's cars.  You don't even notice they are there, until something drops, and then you are thankful!"
"very happy with my purchase, I love"
"My son loves these! He has trouble keeping a normal pacifier in his mouth. This gives his little hands something to hold onto, and he is able to happily suck on his wubba. Even when he isn't awake he holds onto it. The wubba was also required for his one month photo shoot!"
Adorable. But my dog ate it before I could gift it to my nephew.
Perfect! My son loves his wubbanubs. We have bought the cow and dinosaur too. They last and are easy to clean. Will definitely be ordering another soon!
My baby love these
I brought it for my sisters baby Shower and it was so much fun
"My baby wasn't a fan of this particular paci, but they were good quality and exactly as pictured."
Baby's favorite :)
excellent product
Soothies are the best pacifiers in my opinion because the nipple is just like that of a bottle or mother. Both my daughters have used these now for their first few months of adjusting. Great product!
works great and pans all the way around as well as zooms in.
"my 5 month old is very tall (98th percentile), but still was too short for other jumpers. this one is perfect with the 5 height settings! the seat itself is large but if your baby likes to &#34;stand&#34; and has good trunk control the large seat will not be a problem.  he absolutely loves it and can turn himself around to each &#34;station&#34;. definitely recommend!"
my son loves it!  defenitely a favorite!
"love this thing. for times i don't want to lug around a diaper bag this is a lifesaver. i fit a regular sized pampers wipes in there, and then have enough room for about 3-4 size 3 diapers. i also keep a few disposable changing pads in the clutch as well."
i love that there is not a removable spill proof tab.
my grandson is 6 mos old and this is the best investment i have made so far.  keeps him warm without big bulky clothing and it is fog/ moisture proof and wind can't get through it. the bottom opens for feet to stick out so i see at least a couple of years use.
excellent quality and fast shipping. very pleased.
shipping was super fast and my son is so fascinated by his mobile now! the fast music isnt a problem. im extremely happy.
"love the safety features, it's a bit big when it's rear facing, so we had to place it in the middle of our back seat, but it seems very comfortable and my son loves it!"
so good!
"i got the mirror very fast. the quality is very good, but what i like the most is that it is easy to install it on the rear mirror. it is big enough to see everything on the back of my truck and side roads. i really recommend this product."
"like these better the the bumkins. they're the perfect size and they lay flat, which is great when you have a squirmy 8-month-old who won't."
"this product is super efficient! firstly its small enough to fit in my fashionable work bag. 2. the silicone cup makes it softer on the breasts. 3. it's easily assembled/disassembled. 4. it's quiet. 5. got the bottle with the little graphics on it. 6. because the first pull can feel a little strong, i just gently squeeze the lever until my breasts are accustomed and gradually increase pull.7. works on pure suction so i can temper the force of the pull. 8. did i say little and cute? i really appreciate the thought put into its design. i've heard, and still hear horror stories about the manual pump but i have not experienced it. thanks nuk!!!"
"supper quick shipping, great pump!"
"i got this \\baby food storage\\ item to freeze liquid leftovers such as pasta sauce or my chili con carne that i make by the pounds on weekends. i hesitated to spend almost twenty bucks on something that ziplock bags could do, but eventually figured that a reusable container would be cheaper in the long run, and more convenient immediately.<br /><br />i can confirm that the almost-too-good-to-be-true product description is accurate: the silicone cleans ridiculously easily with just soap water, it doesn't warp in the dishwasher, doesn't smell at all, and it remains amazingly supple when frozen to -22c/-8f (that's what my freezer can do; spec says -40c/-40f). getting the frozen food out was initially a bit of a struggle, but one vendor's tip was golden: if i let it sit for one minute at room temperature, the still rock- hard pieces push out easily.<br /><br />the one thing that took a little getting used to was securing the lid. basically, it's a floppy rubber piece with eight latches that are a bit hard to put on, and if you nudge anything while putting it into the freezer, it'll come undone easily. but that's just the price of having a freeze- proof, sealing container, so i won't ding my rating for that."
"excellent product. thick, durable, comfortable, educational! wish they made a larger 10 ft x 10 ft one."
"love this mointor! it gave me total peace of mind becaue my little one slept best on her belly. if i didn't have this i think i would have been a lot more sleep deprived because i would have been afraid to put her on her stomach. this is the second one i purchased because the first one stopped working when my sister tried to use it but i will happily purchase a new one for each baby. i bought this one for her becuase i think it is such a great monitor for the moms that worry. plus, her daughter was 5 weeks early and had some lung issues so this has given her some peace of mind as well. she is also a belly sleeper and my sister just attaches it to the side of her diaper or to the back."
perfect compliment to go with pillow. extremely soft and comfortable!! my wife loved it and was able to sleep so much better while pregnant
"it works great. for the price, the materials are fantastic. i have an easy time adjusting the belts and operating the buckles. i know there were a couple reviews that said they were challenging, but honestly , the hooks work better than the other three carseats we have gone for. the buckles are easy and i can even adjust the belts easily with my bad wrists. a+++ on this . also , delivery was prompt. early even."
very happy. i have both blue and pink
"i used the wrap up until my son learned how to get himself out of it, but it worked its charm in making him sleep when i needed both hands for something. it worked great when travelling also and i didn't want to lug around his stroller. this is one baby accessory you can use over and over again."
these are the absolute best! for such a good price! my kid loves to be swaddled.
"enjoyed the mirror, i am very satisfied with the scooterbugge"
very cute!!!
compact. i love the color and the idea of making them pike keychaine
my husband is the one who found this and i'm very happy that he did.  we were looking for a brush to help loosen my son's cradle cap but everything in the stores was very stiff.  i wanted something soft like the one that was used on me (if only i still had it!). this is the softest baby brush we could find and i love the wooden handle.  my baby is 6 mos old now with a good amount of hair and we still use it on him.  he seems to be happy with it too.  the only thing is it will straighten curly (caucasian) hair but i use cerave on his scalp to help with dry skin and that curls his hair without making it greasy.  i look forward to saving this brush and passing it on.  i'm even considering buying 2 more for my 5yr old & 7 yr old just so they can each have one.  (i'm optimistic that all 3 of my kids will have babies some day but it's okay if they don't.)
"ordered this to fit in delta mini crib (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b002mzmdx8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_26). perfect fit, and firm without being rock-solid. even though this is 3&#34; rather than the 2&#34; recommended by the crib manufacturer, the mattress is firm enough and fits snugly enough that i feel confident that it's safe.<br />comparable in firmness to my daughter's full-size firm crib mattress."
works great!
"life saver!  we attach this to the high chair when we are out, the car seat, and the stroller.  they keep toys from hitting the ground and needing to be cleaned."
if you have a snoogle you must buy this. such a soft and comfortable difference. i absolutely love it.
works very well for elimination communication. our baby has been on the toilet since 6 months old and the seat is very well cushioned to support even the tiniest baby. we also got a cheap one from ikea and this one is waaaaay better!!! and it provides a lift to the knees which is a better body position for pooping :)
great for travelling and super light.
:)
"we got this for our son for his first birthday. he loves it! it doesn't tip easily, even with the rocker attached. the fabric isn't quite what i thought it was going to be, but it still looks and feels great. everyone who sees this chair thinks it's so adorable, and they're right. it also shipped faster than we thought it would! edited to add another photo. he fell asleep in his chair one night! it has come in so handy for when he was sick and didn't have energy to move around. he sat in the chair and watched his cartoons with teddy. a great purchase that i haven't had a single regret about."
excellent product.
"works like a charm.  we don't have many accidents, but there has been the occasional diaper that gets too wet at night. a sippy cup of water spilled once and it never reached the mattress.  very pleased.  washes well, but allow for extra time in the dryer as it soaks up a lot of water in the wash.  naturally."
"these are nice tools for portion control in my ongoing quest to limit what i eat.  they are pretty too, and the lids snap on and off easily."
for the price you can't beat it. the balls get stuck sometime but my daughter (15 months) has no trouble knocking them loose. i like how you can lock it to store the balls with out them rolling out all over the place.
"this made a huge difference in the phoenix weather. we used to carry water bottles around just to try to cool off the metal part of the seat belts because they would literally burn our children's legs. since using these, the metal stays slightly warm instead of scalding hot. highly recommend this product."
great for bm mom's or just for babies comfort!
"i tried many different options before settling for dr. brown's. my baby took to the the bottles early on without any struggle unlike others (medela, playtex, etc.) and i only wished i had tried dr. brown's as our first option.<br />pros: easy to feed, no nipple collapse<br />cons: many moving parts, bottles come with level 1 nipple"
"i absolutely love this crib! it's beautiful, sturdy and the perfect size for our room. it was super easy for my hubby to put together ( me being 7 months pregnant) i watched for moral support and praise :-). my little bundle isn't here yet but it looks beautiful and seems like it will do a great job of keeping our sweet pea comfy. i've now ordered the dream on me dresser changing table and can't wait to see it when it gets here ( also in cherry) the set should look amazing together."
"as most new parents, we were faced with the fear and worry of &#34;what if she stops breathing??&#34; our baby was born premature and so this fear was/is very real as we have seen it happen in the nicu...of course, they have monitors to warn them when this is happening...<br />why shouldn't we have the same warning and peace of mind that we can prevent it also? i searched and searched for an answer and stumbled upon safetosleep. i debated for a long time whether or not to purchase this item as its no small price tag but then what price would i pay for the safety/monitoring as offered in the hospital? i read the reviews and jumped the gun. this item says what it does and actually does it! the alarm will go off for her slight movements but that can be fixed in the sensitivity settings, it has warned us of a drop in her breathing, a rise, and when she gets picked up off the mat ( or rolls off later on). all of these are very useful! i love that i can talk to her using the monitor...i love that it tells me the temp of the room because we can mimic the nicu temp...i love the ease of setting it up and using it!!<br />things i would improve are: 1.different alarm sounds for different things. 2. a backlight. 3. longer battery life (lithium?)<br />4. size options"
very happy. i have both blue and pink
"after reading the reviews on amazon, us new parents decided to purchase the infant optics dxr-5. the setup was easy and the controls on the monitor are easy to understand and maneuver. the monitor works as advertised. we are able to see our boy even amid the darkness of his room and we have the peace of mind that we were unable to achieve with the sound monitor (that is now stored somewhere in our closet). i think this video monitor provides a ton of value and packs a lot of punch for the price. it may not have the bells and whistles (e.g. controlling the camera remotely, zoom features, etc.) but i'd rather have something that works well with the core functionalities. the camera has not failed us thus far and we suspect it will not in the coming future. we definitely recommend this product."
"it's amazing, the quality even better than i expected.it's roomy,well thought-out."
"this is by far one of the most important things we've bought since having a baby. unfortunately, once our baby's boogies get in the aspirator, it turns into my dog's favorite chew toy. i'm on to my fourth nosefrida because the dog keeps eating them.<br /><br />since our little man started day care, he's been sick a ton, and his nose is always stuffed. this product is heaven-sent.  they work so well--its worth every penny."
purchased this for my son's pack and play. the fabric is soft like an old tshirt. exactly what i was looking for.
"it is just the right amount of fluffy, has what seems to be a waterproof layer."
"really cute. ithey're made of lightweight plastic. only thing i would change is the fork & spoon, they're just too wide for little mouths. the fork tines could be spread apart further to make it easier to stab the food & keep it on the fork, and the spoon just needs to be narrower. the elmo handles are easy to hold onto and so darn cute."
beautiful little frame!
this was pretty easy and quick to assemble. my daughter loves bouncing in it!
love the car seat cover it looks great and fits on the car seat perfectly. baby hasn't arrived yet but it looks like it will work well.
loving have extras at work!
love the bigger shield. pumping is difficult for me and this helps yield more due to less restriction.
love it
this is the cutest backpack! my daughter loves it! it also seems to be made really well - which is needed as it carried by a young child.
best bibs! wash great! hold up to a lot of washing and still look brand new though i don't put mine in the dryer.
"does the job perfectly. the way i use it is as following: i preheat the bottle to a bit warmer temp that i would give it to the baby, but it in activated warmer and take it with us. this way the bottle cools a bit, but stays warm enough to comfortably eat. i had never activated on its own or accidentally as i read in one of the reviews, though my daughter had even pulled it out from the drawer and played with it a bit. it won't warm a bottle from a cooler a warm state though. you would need the heater with hot-hot water or something that plugs in (and those take up to 40 minutes to do the job, so i totally prefer this one)."
easy way to portion out homemade baby food. very happy with it.
beautiful
we absolutely love this crib! can't beat it for the price. my sons crib is nowhere near this nice and we paid more. this is definitely the perfect crib! :)
excellent
"i wish i could give this pillow/company 10 stars!<br />honestly, i have never been so blown away by the quality of product and outstanding customer service as i am with this company. prior to ordering these pillows, i had some questions for the manufacturer, little sleepy head pillows, whom i emailed. much to my shock, chris, the owner, actually emailed me back with everything i needed. i then purchased two of these pillows for my twin 4 year old children. they arrived very promptly, and were clearly of good quality, but unfortunately, were too puffy for them, causing their necks to be at a weird uncomfortable angle. we were all so disappointed, so i emailed chris (as he had mentioned that they can custom make pillows), and he told me no problem, that he would make us two &#34;1/2 fill&#34; pillows. within about a week they were made and shipped to us at no charge! chris included a hand written note wishing us the best with the new pillows and to keep the old pillows with his compliments for when the children grow older or to use on trips. are you kidding me? who does that? this company, that's who. i will recommend them to everyone and anyone who will listen. by the way, the '1/2 fill' pillows are perfect in my opinion (for my children anyway), and my children absolutely love them. do not hesitate to buy anything from this company, as no matter what they will bend over backwards to help you.<br />thank you so much again chris!<br />kindest regards<br />nancy"
arrived quickly and was what i was needing! great product and will order from this supplier again.
great
Amazing
Very good!
Amazingly cute bottles for great price! My kid loves them!
Great item
Young mother loved getting this pacifier duo in girl colors as part of her gift
It's so cute. We like it very much.
it good!
"i may have been able to purchase a seat that was a bit cheaper, but the convenience of the click tight and knowing britax's reputation for safety, i feel that my baby is safe and comfortable and that means a lot. you can feel that there is extra padding in the seat for that added comfort. we love it!!!"
just picked them up and within 2 minutes they were installed in my truck. truck is now protected form the rug rats.. great purchase
my baby loves these spoons and its short enough that he can pretend to feed himself without choking himself right away.
this bib is expensive but it's the best one we found.  comfy and absorbent.
"Cute, unique print"
"The only nuk my daughter will take! I love that it is all one piece, so there are no mystery funk  growing!"
it good!
Loved it! Sadly my husband dropped it on the street and I refuse to ever use it again but I did reorder!
Awesome product. My baby loves it!
"Used these for cupcake toppers at a baby shower. Good quality so that mamma can actually use them later, and not so expensive that you have to break the bank to buy 12 of them. Exactly what I needed."
We love it!
We tried a few different brands and these were e only ones out baby would use. It's trial and error bit this was our winner. I like these because they are also easy to clean and there's not a ton of places for water to hide.
pretty and works great!
My baby loves these MAMs and even at 13 months old they are the only type and size she'll use.  We love that they glow in the dark and are so easy to find during night time.
Love it
"it is a pacifier, and it shows my team. Love it."
"my granddaughter loves these!  perfect for the middle of the nite when the pacifier comes out, it is easy to find!  it is a soother also."
Cute for the youngest Bronco fan!
Life saver thanks alot!
Hilarious!  even better because it is BPA free<br />Great seller
Hilarious... Kid only likes it a few minutes but it's hilarious
My daughter has had this for two montha she absolutely loves it. We dont leave the house or go to daycare without it. We even bought an extra for just in case<br /><br />Update: My daughter is now almost 18 months old and we don't go anywhere without her &#34;bug&#34; as she calls him we have gone through two. Not because of her but our dog decided to give it a try also. She loves him so much that before she pops him in her mouth for bed she gives his face a kiss. Best pacifier ever!! I will buy them for all my future kids and friends kids.
Good!
"The design for these pacifiers is great, very easy to clean. Most we've had have a space where water gets trapped and starts looking gunky after a week or two. So when we got these, everything is open so I can wash them as often as I need without the water getting trapped anywhere."
"My daughter only takes &#34;soothies&#34;, and the dinosaur that i recycled from my son who never took pacifiers ended up finally breaking (it took a beating :-( ) so i found this and love it. The elephant is really plush so it gives her a good nice sized 'doll'  to squeeze while shes sleeping, and since she cuddles with it, its nice not having to wake up to slide her passy back in her mouth every few hrs."
Everybody loved this!
"These are THE best pacifiers!  Love, love, love a Wubby :-)"
"I can't find these in the store anymore.  My first child loved them, only one she would take.  I am hoping they work for the one on the way"
"LOVE this Wubbanub! Got one as a baby gift and frankly thought it was kind of dumb. I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck/head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away. Can't believe I'm buying a Wubbanub for my toddler, but a lovey is a lovey for a reason, and he sure does love this giraffe."
"My son loves it, it's easy for him to find at night!!"
"i love these bottles for my 2 year old daughter.  the shatter-proof bottle has taken quite a beating and the straws are well designed and great quality.  i've purchased several of these and they quickly became our bottle of choice.  they're not totally leak-proof, especially if you leave the flip top open, but if they do spill, it's very little.  the only improvement i would recommend for this bottle is to make the strap removable.  it washes fine in the top rack of the dishwasher, but the strap stays wet for quite a bit after you take them out of the dishwasher."
"these are so soft. they are so great for swaddling and cuddling. they are perfect as burp rags, staying cool in the summer, blocking the sun, as a blanky. i highly recommend."
these are perfect for bottles needed away from home. we don't have to carry a large formula container around and we also don't have to premix and worry about refrigerating or it going bad if not used in the day we mixed. it's nice to just fill with formula and pop into a bottle filled with water and keep separate until ready for use.
"great buy!<br />a good, plain and soft bib is always necessary!"
i love the weight and feel of this blanket. the color is beautiful too.
"i love this changing pad so much.  i used it for my kids, then bought it for friends as well.  it keeps it's form well and is easy to clean."
love it
love the colors and size.  bought the month ones also.  several of my mommy friends have asked where i got them.
"looks great, perfect on the size thank you for the quick shipping!"
Nice quality for a stuffed llama I guess!  My kid loves it any ways!
my daughter and son both loved these!
loved
"These are our favorite. My son took the the infant size immediately after birth after trying several others, so we've stuck with them."
Omg!!! My baby boy Love his pacifier every kid should have 1!!!!!!!
good!
We got the baseball binkis! My son is 10 1/2 months old and loves these binkis the most!
"The dragon is well made and nicely weighted so it helps hold the pacifier in place.  The legs, wings and tail are chunky and solid enough that my infant can grab hold of them and pull the pacifier up to his mouth.  Like all the WubbaNubs we own, the dragon has been really useful (hard to lose, easy to find in the dark, easy for tiny fingers to hang on to) and I can't imagine going back to using the Soothies without a WubbaNub."
Great
We lover these binkys.  Our son has used sever different ones but we found that other brands can get water in the nipple when washed and I always fear there will be bacteria that grows.  These are great and very cute.  Our son is 11 months so we will be retiring these soon but we have another baby due in April and plan to start using MAM from the start.
realy good
Great product!!!!
The cutest thing ever!! The twins love it.
"shaped a little differently than most pacifiers, as it doesn't contour to the baby's cheeks, but that's perfect if you need to increase airflow and discourage teething rash."
Fantastic
My little man loves this! It's super cute and soft and everyone loves it!
Great product! Bought as a gift for my nephew. Everyone got a kick out of them
My kid love these

I really enjoyed and recommend.
Will be getting more of these! My little girl loves them! We have tried other types of pacifiers with her and these are the best one for us and her! Love the variety of them also.
:)
This is so cute! I can't wait to see my new grandaugher with this! I am so glad I purchased it.
"He loves these,and I bought this one as a backup incase we forget his regular one at home. He is inlove with his red dog one though. lol"
My  granddaughter has never really liked a pacifier which is both good and bad. The only one she would use at all is this one. It's very durable and made it through the washing machine several times showing no signs of wear. Well worth the investment.
The only bink my 6 mo old will take!
this is awesome invention!!
The best for breast fed babies!
Washes well. Perfect pacifier!
:)
These are wonderful .  Every baby should get a wubbanub.
"My baby like it, is shock and bite resistant =).. not so much to say about a Pacifier. It's cool to buy a pair of translucent Pacifiers because the baby cannot recognize de difference of color if you misplace or lose one of them (some babies are picky)"
"Our son loves this pacifier and is the only one he takes at night. We had tried several other ones prior to this one, and this is the only one he could keep in his mouth for more than a few minutes. Also, he was able to put it back in his mouth quicker than with other ones due to the nice big handle on it."
These are the best and are darling. I had them for my kids and I buy one for every baby shower. I can't resist them. A binkie and a stuffy! What could be cuter!
Best bobo's ever. Theyre not sold in stores anynore. This was my son's favorite and is now my daughter's favorite as well (4 years later!).
"My son loves the Soothie Pacifier!  I am so glad I found these yellow pacifiers because there are literally 6 other kids at his daycare that have the green or blue soothie pacifier.  It is so hard for the teachers to keep the pacifiers straight with so many kids having the same one.  This yellow pacifier just solved the problem for me!  I am so happy!  I highly recommend this pacifier.  I have been told that breastfed babies prefer the shape of this pacifier - my son was breastfed and he would not take the other shaped paci's, so that could be true?  I'm not sure - all I know is that this pacifier is the only brand my son will use."
Holds up to a toddler's wear and tear and can be washed and dried.  AWESOME!
These paci's are the best.  Big kahuna loves them and he gets all the chicks with his new handlebar moustache.
"Love this , great product"
"My little boy love's his George, that's what we call his WubbaNub Monkey! Great product... Helps with keeping the pacifier in and the most important thing, not losing it!"
Baby and mama love it! The colors a for the baby to look at :)
"Very cute,  quick to receive"
Cute!
"perfect pacifiers, our little man seems to enjoy them and it's easy to spot him (and the paci) in a dark room. Need to &#34;power up&#34; with a bright light before use, not unlike many other glow in the dark products. Can't compare to other paci's as MAM has been ours since he was a newborn"
My daughter loves these pacifiers! They are very cute.
My daughter loves it! Easy for her to manage and she loves the soft material.
What a cute product.  These are great if your child uses a pacifier.  Makes it easier to locates with an animal attached.
excellent calendar to keep track of milestones
love it
very cute.  fits well.  high quality.
i bought this toy for my 6 month old grandson for christmas. he absolutely loves it! he has the football and why not add the round oball. what i like about this ball.... it's easy to handle.... he could grab it with his chubby little fingers!  i would definitely recommend this toy.
love this saying...and it's so true...if only we believe...just look at yourself and you'll see a living miracle!
fox pattern is very cute! my daughter loved it!
"i didn't research much about high chairs for kids, as it gets exhausting - every time we need something it means days spent online and in stores comparing different options. this time decided to trust to peg perego's brand and wasn't disappointed. the chair is very sturdy built, the baby is secured in place even if the tray is off, the fabric is easy to wipe. i also love that it is easy to fold and it stands on it's own folded. would recommend it to a friend."
"this rail is great. nice and sturdy and once tightened and fastened, it stays there. had trouble with another brand coming unfastened. when you lower the rail it is completely out of the way so you can change the sheets without removing the rail. this is nice and long and fits clear to the mattress snugly with no gap. this was actually purchased to keep a small dog from falling on the hardwood floor when she has seizures at night. it works great and now we don't worry that she will break something having a fall. this is really worth the extra cost!"
great. it is highly recommended.
i love this little bag. i use it to contain my reusable menstrual pads and diva cup when i'm out and about. it has a dry pouch (the small one) and a wet pouch (the large one) that work great for carrying both clean and used items. it comes in so many cute prints too!
"love this item as your typical apprehensive, cautious, and worrisome first time mom for my infant! gives you the water temperature immediately, and my five-week-old daughter enjoys looking at the light illuminating from the turtle, which remains lit for the duration of the bath, as long as it is submerged in water, serving as a distraction if ever she gets fussy. would highly recommend!"
great pilot and great service
"we love this carrier. baby sits in a more natural position and is easy to get in and out of, even without help."
"worked perfectly! if you haven't tried these things and are using safety pins, which i don't feel are really that safe, give these a try! the teeth on them are sharp but it's very easy to get the snappi on without accidentally pushing anything too far and poking a squirming baby. you just stretch it over and release. so easy!"
very nice..very large..good quality
excellent product. glad i made this purchase.
love it!
this is the best nap mat on the market. worth every penny!
awesome and the baby loved it
"nice, easy to put together. my daughter loves her new car seat."
this fits perfectly over the mats at daycare. it rolls up nice and neat. the fleece blanket on the top is plenty warm. throw the whole thing into the washer and dryer and you are good to go! this is great product that i wish i would have found a long time ago!
"i absolutely love this crib set. it fit our nursery, perfectly."
my 2 year old loves this pillow! all though he takes the pillow case off every night. it's still a perfect little pillow for my toddler ;)
perfect for wet/sandy water shoes on vacation!
love it!
great product arrived promptly
i love how light the car seat is.  it is very easy to pull in and out of the base as well.  i am very happy with this product.
"great for my 22month old, he loves the bottle the only bad thing is my son bites the nipple and i have to replace it."
"the little girl this went to loves it.  very colorful, and made very well.  i think there will be years of enjoyment.."
awsome love it.
gave to new grand baby and parents use it a lot as they live in arizona.
nice
looks very sleek and works exactly like it looks and says.
Love the design and material.
What a great pair of pacifiers. The colors are really great and it's of a nice quality. This is a gift for a friend's baby shower.
My baby's favorite pacifiers. The glow in the dark only works for a short time and is very dim so don't buy it expecting it to glow all night. Its also orthotic.
Got this for my friend's little boy! It is very funny and adorable! Great quality! Arrived early.
My twins love these & prefer them to any other pacifier
"My baby uses munchkin latch bottles, and these are his favorite pacifiers.  I gave him many options, but he chose to match bottle to paci.  Also, just and FYI ... I breastfeed and don't have problems switching back and forth.  I'm not sure if that is kid dependant or has something to do with the brand."
Love it
"I bought the monkey and elephant for my 7 week old who could not seem to keep the pacifier in his mouth on his own. Before the wubbanub, I'd have to sit and hold the pacifier in for him. The wubbanub helps keep the pacifier in his mouth. When his head is turned to the side, I can prop the wubbanub in between my son and the side of his swing or bassinet. The monkey also lies flat on his chest and holds the pacifier in when he's looking straight up. Although my sons isn't quite old enough to grasp the monkey with his hands, I can kind of wrap my sons arms around the monkey to help him keep it in place.<br /><br />I found that the elephant is too floppy and doesn't work as well because the pacifier is attached to the elephant's trunk. The pacifier with the elephant doesn't stay in his mouth as well as the one with the monkey."
Love that these breathe well for my toddler!
"These pacifiers are the only ones I'll let my daughter use. I love that they are completely natural so she is not sucking on dangerous chemicals, and I also love that they are all one piece so there are no crevices for germs to hide in, I also love the look of them. My daughter is EBF so she doesn't take a pacifier much, but these are great teethers also! We have purchased several teethers but she prefers these over most of them!"
"My grand baby uses these, bought them as part of a gift for someone else. Love em!"
"Our son love this! Great pacifier shape for a newborn, and he can easily take it out when he is done. And you can't lose these easily!"
Good choice. My little one loves them.
great buy. item arrived as expected.
Perfect.. Baby prefers this kind over all others we've tried.
good
I have two new grandsons and they love this adorable reindeer!
love them
It was great I loved it!
GREAT!
Loved them :) theyre perfect for my baby girl
"This is the ONLY pacifier that my child can use, all the others that I have tried caused a gag reflex response. We tried not using a pacifier but babies need something to soothe them. I had tried the Dr. Brown's pacifier stage 1 (for younger babies)  but my baby would just spit it out or it would come out. It was like it wasn't long enough. I figured I just try the ones for older babies Stage 2. I am glad I was able to find these pacifiers because it is not fat or bulky. It is thinner, almost flat and elongated. It doesn't cause my baby to gag at all! I wish they would provide two covers, one for each pacifier but they only provide one for both. I still gave them five stars because these things work for my child. No more sleepless nights or fussy baby! Yay!"
Great product - would it always recommend
really cute
"works well, sweet lamb."
"Great pacifier, I don't use any other kind!"
Love the color!
Good
"My kids always loved these as babies. If the pacifier always falls out of their mouth, but they still want it,  you can kinda prop the stuffed animal part against them to help hold it in their mouth."
As described and hilarious
Our two boys loves these. Only problem with it is that our older boy steals the younger's passy since he can see it in the dark now :)
Good
"Great, sturdy big kid binkie!"
Great price.
Love these
"Love, love, love these pacifiers!  So cute, and the stuffed animal makes it easier for babies to hold these pacifiers.  They're also much easier to keep track of than the standard variety.  Just throw them in the washing machine to clean.  Wubbanubs are so popular in my house, they've become one of my go-to baby shower gifts.  Highly recommended."
Great product!
Bought for granddaughter.  She really digs this and reaches for it all the time.
These are great. Very durable. I figured the rubber mustache would be cheesy and break. Still holding on strong. It is a hoot!
Love it love it. Baby loves too.
Nice

Just throw them in the washing machine to clean.  Wubbanubs are so popular in my house, they've become one of my go-to baby shower gifts.  Highly recommended."
"Just purchased this after reading reviews on a Mom FB page.  This pacifier is great!  Slides right into my baby's mouth and doesn't come out as often as the Philips Avent pacifier which I had been previously using (since that pacifier has a little handle). At first I didn't like that it didn't have a handle, but that's one of the reasons why it doesn't fall out.  Very cute prints too.  Also it comes with a sanitizing box which you fill with a little bit of water and sanitize in the microwave!  Genious!!  I will be purchasing a couple more boxes to have extras lying around since we are always losing pacifiers."
Good deal
So cute
"We tried this pacifier out after trying many different ones. This is the only pacifier my little one will ( kind of) take! She doesn't like pacifiers and tends to gag with most of them, but she will occasionally take these in the car when she's starting to get fussy. The nipple on these seems smaller than others we've tried so I'm assuming that's the reason."
My baby started with wubba nub at birth. She learned how to grasp the doll part early on. She loves it! It's a must have!!!
"My son is 18 months old and cannot live without his wubbies. We have 4 of them, and the frog is the lightest in weight. He has been using a green soothie pacifier since being an infant, and we introduced the wubby around 7 months when he was old enough to reach for his paci in the crib at night. This little product helped him go back to sleep because he could soothe himself immediately once he retrieved his wubby. We only let him have it in the crib because it is quite an addiction. We let him have two - one to suck and one to cuddle. He switches them out intermittently. Not sure how to begin weening him from using it, but for now we are deeply satisfied with this product."
"The best baby shower gift I ever received.  I bought this as a replacement since we lost ours for a bit ( never hurts to have a backup).  This became our sons beloved toy and comfort pacifier at all times.  We have now weaned him off at a year and a half.  But, we will definitely be purchasing another type of WubbabNub for our new baby."
It's best to buy in bulk! I saved money and had backups for when pacifiers got thrown out of the stroller! It's the only kind my granddaughter would take.
Love them. Makes finding a pacifier much easier now
"Daughter started on these and we can't buy enough! They are chained and tethered to everything we own! She won't take any other style and at this price, I can afford double!"
Excellent product!!!
"If baby loves it, I love it. Amazon having them on sale = bonus"
These are great and my son loves his. Easy for them to hold and to find! I just throw them in the washing machine and they are clean :)
Great buy
We lost our sons first and only one of this wubbanub at Disney and we were devastated! Found this one and ordered right away! It shipped so fast and got to us even faster!! Our son was so happy and so were we!
Love it! Go LSU Tigers! 
These are amazing! My baby loves only these...
Super cute!!!
Babies first love of a paci
good
Love this purchase it is so cute and you can't find this one in stores.
Nice package and my friend is happy to receive it for her new born baby.
My little one loves this!  It's now our favorite!
Best pacifiers ever! These last so long and I love that they are natural. I love the size of these as well. Just make sure to boil them when you get them for five minutes as directed. I am a repeat customer for these.
So cute. love this!
love it
love it!!! great inside and outside
i bought this for a friend - the baby loves it.  she uses this as a teething ring - her favorite!
this is the best seat there is for extended rear facing. best value. so easy to use. will last a really long time. we love it!!!!
the mini crib mattress is very good quality and fits the davinci mini crib perfectly.  very happy with purchase.
very cute!
love that i can keep things plugged in and babies safe!
super soft and just the right size for a toddler
this is great! it adds more space for them to roll. it works great on hardwood too because of padding.
this is a nice towel and a good size for my 15-month old granddaughter. it washed up very well.
our toddler is all about cookie monster and elmo right now so when i saw this i had to get it for him.  he loves it!!  the towel looks great and is plenty big enough for our 18mo.  its not a super heavy weight fabric but its not cheap hotel towel thin either.
"are you confused about what kind of car seat to buy. just get a britax. the safety is great. the clicktight models have a nice recline, even in forward facing. i shopped around a lot trying to find a seat that was affordable and filled our needs. it was a waste of time. should have gotten the britax right away."
"i'm trying to teach my 15 month old how to self feed using utensils. which means meal times are incredibly messy. yes these bibs are large, but they cover up everything, even part of the high-chair. this saves her clothes from being completely ruined by apple sauce, spaghetti sauce, mushed carrots, and anything else she can manage to make a huge mess out of. plus they are easy to clean, you can (thoroughly) rinse them off in the sink and hang dry them or wash in cold water on delicate cycle and hang them to dry. if you are buying them to add to outfits for everyday use i wouldn't bother. they are meant for keeping food off of your child while they master the art of self feeding. i love them so much i'm ordering more."
"just got mine today. absolutely love everything about this black backpack. i would recommend it to all my mom friends, it also can be worn by daddy. fits everything i need for the baby and myself :) bought this for baby #2. i have an about to be 3 year old and a new one on the way. had a regular diaper bag with my first and hated it! im so in love with this diaper backpack!"
"use these in my 2500sqft two story house and they work perfectly. would recommend to anyone who needs nice good quality, for a reasonable price."
really cute.
"my kids are always spilling something, writing on something or finding other ways to make a mess.  this seat protect is a must have for my family and fit nicely on the back seat of my 2013 vw passat.  this product provides great protection, and is easy to install.  i would highly recommend!"
great gate. bought additional eyelets so we can use the gate where ever our grand children are playing. plan to buy another
"wow, now this is a nice seat. after searching store after store for a quality booster, i finally decided to order the britax parkway sgl online since no store around me carried it. this seat latches in securely and the back of the seat is locked in and not going anywhere. my wife bought a couple of cheap graco seats for her car and am always annoyed how they fall apart when you take them out and slide around when no kids are in them. really cool how the back of this seat slides in and will not fall apart when moving. padding is superior to other seats i have looked at."
the quality is excellent
very good.<br />easy to use and convenient to wash.
my six month old loves it. best toy.
"amazing cup!!! i have been really over using my daughters straw cups and losing all the pieces or trying to keep them clean and wanted something spill proof but simpler and i stumbled across these!! omg i cant say enough good about them!! easy to clean and use, my daughter is 2 and was a little confused at first but picked it up quickly! they are 100% spill proof and after a week of use, so far i have nothing but great things to say about them! they have been dropped, washed in the dishwasher, and every other day to day use and so far holding up very well with my destructive toddler! you wont be disappointed! i just ordered 3 more!! :)"
"this cups are awesome! however, i wish there was a way to choose between girl cups and boy cups... i have ordered them for my son twice and have gotten the most girly ones possible both times....  on the plus side, his baby sister can use them when she gets old enough so i am choosing to keep them.... still need to find some for him though."
"good product, prompt delivery time. great price.  no problem to assembly them, you just have to check the picture in the instruction carefully to match the holes, no additional tools needed.  everything is in the whole package."
the bedding set was even nicer than on line. my grandson likes trains and  i just happened to see the bedding set on line and he needed a new one.
love this banana. 6 month old won't take any pacifier or anything but he took the banana! perfect size for baby and looks like toothbrush end really soothes his teeth/ gums. i do not leave home without now.
"i love these diapers for nighttime.  they usually don't leak until morning after a 12 hour night, if at all.  i use one of the microfiber inserts that came with the diaper and 2 or 3 hemp inserts under that."
"these cups are great, though i failed to notice they are not the insulated ones. no worry though, the girls don't mind."
stays on great and has a wonderful rattle that my baby can notice and hear!
"so far, i love this crib.  i did not experience the smell of paint or any foul odor as some have reported.  the construction is nice and sturdy.  we have not yet had the opportunity to convert it as my daughter is 1 but plan to do so in the future.  it was exactly what we were looking for."
these pacifiers are my favorite for my son. they make it so much easier to find instead of blindly searching around in his crib in the dark for the pacifier.
very cute and very good quality.  all of the crocheted rattles by this company are adorable and make great gifts
my mom used the pillow and knitted a cover for it along with a blanket for the crib. the pillow is so soft and it's just the right size. the pillow is quality constructed and should last quite a while. chris from the company even inquired about the purchase to see if everything was alright. i appreciate that extra attention and it shows that they care. thanks!
excellent gift for my daughter. recommended 100%. venezuela.
one problem though..no harness on top to keep baby from leaning forward.
"we love this little pillow, thank you so much!!!!"
works great. i was also impressed with the pen. i love the way it writes. the cap snaps on and stays on tight. if your reading this because your researching stylus buy this now!
perfect accessory for my baby's snoopy themed room!
"fast shipping, good price"
good
"best money we've spent on the kid. he doesn't like his bassinet so much; i think it's a bit too big and open for him, he seems to like the coziness, gentle rocking and the incline offered by the rnp. it's really a nice little travel bed for him, too, and easy to fold/carry. it would be even better if it had a shoulder strap, but, whatever. the first two nights he was home he was really fussy and barely slept (after six weeks in the nicu on an inclined bed). the third night, we opened this package and put him in the rocker--he was out for like four hours. get one. you'll love it."
perfect!  and my daughter can't get out of it!
love this cup.
"i love this dust ruffle!! high quality fabric and coordinates with other items in the space bot collection.  easy to put on.  haven't had to wash it yet, but don't expect any problems."
"my 1 and 2 yr old absolutely love their stars.  before we leave their rooms at night they both ask for theirs stars.  also my 2 yr old was a nightmare he would get out of bed all night and fuss or play but with his stars now he stays in bed.  these stars actually light up their whole ceiling and parts of their walls too and their rooms arent tiny so i love that, i highly recommend this for toddlers :)"
best high chair out there!  super easy to clean and our daughter is comfortable in it.
very warm
loved it.
"great diaper bag! plenty of room and pockets inside. tons of zippered pouches on the outside. the wipe compartment right on the outside is the best part. also, it's big enough without being ridiculously huge. love it!"
the trailer arrived quickly and without damage. was easy to assemble. have not had a chance to tow the trailer so i can not comment on that yet. i did pack the bag with all my camping gear to make sure everything would fit and it does. very happy with my purchase will update after i pull the trailer a few time loaded.
"my three year old loved his &#34;blue blankie&#34; from pottery barn, so i got a second one just incase it went missing. after his baby brother came, he dug out a baby shower gift and began carrying around his &#34;baby&#34;.... everywhere...... almost lost him once and it was bad. insert my search to find a second one incase &#34;baby&#34; got left somewhere or lost at disney. fast shipping, perfectly new product with tags, thank you!!!!!!!!"
love these things!
my 5 month old son loves this toy! i attach it to his jumperoo and it's been his favorite so far.
i am not a fan of their swaddle pods but i love these! we could not have survived the first three months without them. they are a great deal and for the amount of washing we did to them they held up great. we were swaddle challenged and these make it really easy.
i loved it
arrived promptly and was exactly as described
works perfectly! my daughter's teeth don't pierce through and now i don't have to worry about her consuming the shellac on her crib
"we love this roomy pack n play, which is so much bigger than the other ones. we have a tall baby who scoots around in her sleep so this is perfect for her to sleep over at the grandparents, but also play in during the day. love it."
the doll was soft and looked nice. my wife purchased it for our 10 month old niece for christmas and she seemed to really like it.
great
"it was great, it was a gift for my at-the-time unborn niece/nephew and i'm sure she is going to love it. her mom (uom alum) sure did!"
"it keeps the baby warm, specially in the fall/winter time. it fits perfect the changing pad and bassinet mattress."
"Fits perfectly onto the Ikea Malm dresser which is slightly too narrow for most changing pads. The downside is that baby grew too long within a year - but that's not the changing pad's fault!! Now I just change him on the bed, floor or anywhere else that he can't injure himself as the dresser would be too dangerous now that he can move around! I found it difficult to figure out which cover would fit it before purchasing, but this cover fits perfectly: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ES00DQ/"
Excellent.
These are my boy's favorite... very light weight.
"We love wubbanubs! I didn't want to use pacifiers with my first born, but after 2 nights of screaming in the hospital I gave in, so her first paci was a soothie. When we got home, we started using the wubbanub and my daughter learned how to push the paci back in her mouth in just a couple months. The stuffed animal has also saved us from dropping wubbanub on the ground numerous times, since there is something to catch or sometimes get stuck on something else. We washed it in the laundry with natural detergent and let it air dry and never had any problems. We give these as gifts to our new mom friends now and no one leaves home without the Wub."
"Baby loves it, cool looking just like the one you get from the hospitals."
Really cute. Hold two pacifiers nicely.
baby grandson's favorite
Best pacifiers ever. Babies love them!
Baby seems to love it
Good!!! I love it!!!
Loved it!
very cute

Love it
essential my baby loves this-<br />a pain to clean but child loves it so much I deal with it
"We love these binkies, they are the only ones my baby takes. They don't create pressure on the palette, and they're cute. My only complaint is that the paint scratches very easily. But, because of the benefits we will keep using them happily."
So cute!  Love it.  My  loves it too....well at least chewing on it'sonit's gs arms and head.
my cousin loved this for baby boy.
Great product!
My son loves these. He takes other pacifiers but doesn't keep them in as well as he does this one. I'm so glad I decided to try these.
My baby loves these!  He can even hold on to them himself and he's only a week old.  I recommend these!
Very good product.
Very good product.
I like these better than the Nuk brand because they are one piece.  No water getting in to the middle.
Adorable
"We have been through 3 different types of pacifiers MAM, traditional with the tilted nipple and the Soothie. Baby A has constantly spit out every pacifier besides the MAM, Baby B really is not that picky but he too holds onto this pacifier as if it was golden breast milk lol.<br /><br />The air is perfect for teething babies as well, I'm not even sure I want to try any other type of MAMs."
My daughter loves these pacifiers as well as the Latch bottles everything else would just fall right out of her mouth
Our daughter loves her wubbanub!  I would recommend it to any parents as a great pacifier option.
The only one my 4 month old will use.
Love them
I love this brand of pacifier! My The sanitizing box is a huge plus. My baby seems to like this style better than the &#34;standard&#34; ones.
so cute!
The best pacifiers I found for my daughter.
These are fantastic!
"A gift for our new grandson, hope it keeps him quiet, I mean happy!  Anyway, my son was happy with it for his little tyke."
"How am I on my third kid and only just now considered glow in the dark pacis? Every paci-loving baby needs these! Not only am I able to easily find them in the middle of the night, but my baby has learned to find them also, which means less help from mama. A must-have!"
My son loved wubbas but I like this one in particular because it's light and the ease of stuffing it into a jean pocket!  Not all wubbas are equal....
My baby loves this pacifier. It is very thin across the gum line and has a nice size for the bulb. She's had other MAM pacifiers and this is her favorite. I like the design of the plastic outer part as it allows for good airflow. I would recommend this pacifier - especially parents who use MAM bottles. The MAM perfect pacifier has a truly unique design.
given as a gift to expecting parents they loved them
Love love love!!!  So cute!!
Love it !
Love these
This puts a whole new perspective on pacifiers!  I love this product and have ordered three!  From an early age my baby has been able to get his pacifier and put it back into his own mouth.  Plus the plush animal offers a lot of comfort to him.  LOVE LOVE LOVE these!
This bag is going to work great for our new baby. It has tons of space and and my wife loves the design.
My son LOVE wubbanub pacifiers.  Theyre the only kind he will use. Great quality product.
The best invention ever.
Super cute colors...got as a gift because these are the only ones my 3 daughters  used.....
All good - thanx
Simply the BEST pacifier for picky babies.
haha - hilarious!
"mam is the only bottle I use for my kids. it is amazing for nursing moms.. all my kids transitioned from nursing to bottles and with MAM bottles it seems a smooth one. After my second child i also discovered that you can sterilize the bottles without the annoying bulky microwave sterilizers! you simply take the bottom apart and add some water and then pop it in the microwave for a minute or so... amazing! the only semi-annoying part is that sometimes if you don't put the bottom back properly it leaks... but by the third child, I just wash them in the dishwasher and don't even bother to take it a part (the dishwasher is great since it cleans the bottom very well without any mildew or anything...). My kids also love MAM pacifiers and always look at me if I try to give them a different brand as if &#34;what are you giving me? this is not the one i like!&#34;... great products altogether. BIG FAN!"
Love this
Exactly as advertised Great deal and good quality and fast shipping will definitely recommend and come back soon thanks again.
My LO loved it!!
Loved it.  definitely a favorite gift for my grandson.
I love these!!!!!!  I don't have to worry about losing binkies all over the place.
We had the giraffe WubbaNub until my older child misplaced it so we ordered the Brown Puppy as a back up (we ironically found the giraffe the day this one came!). My baby love this binky just as much as the giraffe - they are the only two binkies he'll take. They are also harder to lose and easy for the baby to grab and manipulate themselves. We recommend WubbaNubs to all of our new parent friends.
My kid loves his Wubbanub! These things are great.
"I will forever love this little thing because of how much my baby loved it during her first few months (now she's nearly 9 months and since about 5 months old she's refused to use it as an actual paci and chews on it instead!). If we didn't have it with us during those early days, I would get a little antsy because I knew how much my baby relied on it to soothe herself.    Now, I will say this - it's white, which is probably not the best color choice when it comes to a kid's toy, and if I knew that it'd look pretty dirty even after washing it many times, I may have gotten one that would hide the bit of grubbiness. But it is a very sweet little lamb and I'll be keeping it as a keepsake for her."
Love it!
Babies love these!! They can play with the animals as they fall asleep!
Love that these come with covers
Great design for a product.
"The only brand our lactation consultant recommends, & now the only kind our daughter will take. Love these!"
Baby love it .
"I give Wubbanub's as gifts to people with new babies for very good reason. New born's won;t use them, but after about the 2nd month, the parents realise why I gave them this thing :-)"
"I purchased this for our Nuby Soothie pacifiers. I read the reviews and was a bit concerned with many reviews saying that it was very difficult to open, some saying impossible. I was concerned as I have Fibromyalgia and can hardly open jars, heavy doors and other things with my hands. I took the chance and bought one, hey it was only $3.99 with free shipping! When I received the case I immediately went to open it with the provided latch and yes it was difficult but I found a more than easier way to open the case. If you squeeze the two sides of the case, it instantly pops open. I barely have to put pressure on the case and its quickly open. Yes, I realize the latch should be easy to open but I found this way worked and seems to be a great way. This easily fits two soothie pacifiers in the case. The clip is a little flimsy but I believe it's made that way so you can clip it on nearly anywhere. I think an improvement would be an actual caribeanner clip to ensure it doesn't fall off. Although I have not had the problem of it falling off. It's so wonderful I purchased another one!"
we are very happy with these pacifiers.  they really glow at night!!  good choice.
New aunt
"As usual, same quality from Advent Classic, we all love. I just bought this bottle because it is limited edition and I needed to stand out from the other moms who use the classic bottle."
"Bought for my future niece/nephew, dad-to-de thinks its awesome. It may be more of a novelty paci, vs. an everyday go to, but it is right up their alley."
Grand daughter loved it and I could find it.
Super cute and makes the baby look absolutely hilarious!
Great quality!!
"This thing is so cute!! It's a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be, but i don't know why i expected it to be bigger. It is for a baby after all. Duh.<br />But! we have a brand new baby, and this stays in his mouth so much better than a normal pacifier! He folds his little hands over it and it looks like he is snuggling it.<br />Sooooo adorable &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3"
"I bought this paci when my son was about 2-3 months old because I thought it was super cute. My son is now 8 months and has yet to use it, he stopped using his pacifier around 2 months old so I never got around it giving it to him. I still think it's so cute!"
These are great pacifiers. If my son takes them out of the house at least one person is always commenting on how cute they are. My son uses the monkey as a comfort/lovie in addition to just sucking on the pacifier.
"My son loves this type of pacifier.  I love how once he was old enough to put it in his mouth, the giraffe helped him to find it in the dark so he could put it in his mouth himself.  This type of pacifier on its own will bounce a good distance if tossed or spit out by baby however the giraffe helps minimize the bounce factor to about zero.  well worth the investment that we bought a second one in case the first one was lost or misplaced.  So far haven't had to pull out the backup one after almost a year."
"Best option for nursing baby if choose to give pacifier. Despite being a strong believer in nursing and therefore originally adamantly opposed to using a pacifier, I learned pacifiers are helpful for some children. These were recommended by occupational therapists to help baby learn to suck. Also good for oral development at times. Easy to sanitize, simple, reliable."
"Baby loves these things, but so does the dog. Just means we need to order more I guess. The nipple will invert slightly as well so when you are trying to ween baby off of the soother you can do that, and then after a while cut the stuffed animal off the soother part. Baby isn't old enough for that for me yet, but I'm looking forward to see if that works!"
It's ok
Liked it
Love how they glow in the dark! Easier to find in the dark!
"The wubbanubs are cute and my granddaughter and great niece love them. With the animals attached to the pacifier, they are easy to find when they decide to throw them down."
Works great for our picky newborn who hates a &#34;classic&#34; type of pacifier! She even likes to hold onto this pacifier when it's in her mouth. I like the fact that this pacifier is made from one solid piece of material and is easy to clean. Would recommend!
Favorite pacifier hands down. Very light weight and stays in my sons mouth. When he was younger (4 months or so) he did get his finger stuck in the little hole - so beware. Once he had enough coordination to handle the pacifier it wasn't a problem.
So cute!
adorable and baby loves it
very cute
I love it beyond cute... and my kids enjoy cuddling with there giraffe
My 3 month old loves them.
Love theses pacis!
Arrived quickly and as described.
if you have a binky kid you know how important these are.
Excellent product.  I bought these for my first granddaughter ... now for  my 2nd granddaughter.<br />Great quality ... I would buy again.
"Love them. Great quality. Shape is big enough for a 6 months baby. (Tried NUK, left marks on baby's face)<br />Nice msg, makes me happy by looking at them.<br />Handy to have the case to sterilize the dummy at anywhere with a microwave. Great purchasing !"
Love it!
My nephew loves his long horn bull soother! He can cuddle it while he falls asleep. Fur is soft and the bull is a good shape. He's a nice weight and feels good in your hands.
"Bought this for my nephew. He loves the soothie pacifier, it safely rested on his tummy and kept it in is mouth when he suck REALLY hard (they normally shoot away). When he started teething he chewed all over this thing."
My grandaughter & grandson love the wubbanubs !!
These are as close to the hospital ones as I could find. My baby loves them and I actually like these BETTER than the hospital one because the hole on the ring is big enough for me to put my finer thru so that I can hold it without getting germs on the nipple.
"These soothe my baby, so I love them. I wash by hand and haven't had any problems yet. Nice that it comes with a little clear plastic cover that snaps over the nipple part, since these tend to attract fuzz, however one cover broke fairly quickly."
Great products
Quality product that is true to description
It is as described and works great!
Love
Love it!
"We have 3 Wubbanubs and by far this one is my favorite because it is wide and flat so it stays in place better.  Since my little one has issues with sucking, I swaddle him tight and put the Wubbanub under the blanket. If he turns his head, he can turn back and find it again. With our other wubbanubs, they wobble and don't stay in place as well. When he is awake, he does like the dinosaur best because it is thin and easier for him to hold but this one does the trick for sleepy times."
It was great
Works great for our 3 months old and I love that they glow so I can find it in the night without using a light.
I love this pacifiers
My son was born with PRS and these are the only pacis that work for him and his high palete.  He can hold it in his mouth and create suction.  Love them!
"Shipped fast with Prime, product as advertised."
Our daughter loves these and they seem to hold up really well.
"This is our most favorite wubbanub.  My son will only use 'ducky' and 'lamby', and I'm not sure what we would do without them!!!  I buy this for all new mommies that I know.  My son loves to hold onto lamby's ears and ducky's arms, and it's amazing in the middle of the night how he can hold onto these guys and feel for them in his crib when they fall out of his mouth."
"Cute, streamlined, gets the job done. Since I only paid six dollars, it gets all five stars!  I do have to be careful if diapers are sopping wet, but it can handle my son's usual heavily damp diapers just fine."
My grandson loved it. Great product
"Arrived fast, exactly as described"
Lil one loves it! Silicone and BPA Free!
Absolutely love! My Lil nephew adores it. Can't get it out of his grip. Super easy to find if he does drop it or if mommy n daddy set it down.
Good Nuk pacifier.  Cute design.
"This is very similar to the ones that they use at the hospital.  It does not have the typical bulb shape that is flexible.  Instead the plastic of the entire pacifier is sturdier.  In the babies mouth, the pacifier does not bend and catch on the babies gums.  Because of this, the pacifier will fall out of the babies mouth when they are sound asleep.  This is actually a good thing because it teaches baby that they need to self-soothe at night time.  As I mentioned earlier, the shape and texture are different - very similar to a thumb.  Since this is so similar to the thumb, your baby might choose to self soothe by sucking on their thumb.  While this can be good because they will stop using the pacifier on their own, it can be a problem if they continue to suck their thumb months later."
Love these bottles
Good buy
Excellent as desvribed
Perfect!
"My son loves this. He's used it everyday for going on 2 months now. It's the only binky we haven't lost. I wish he would take a different kind of binky as the rubber catches on everything and comes out of his mouth easily, but besides that, the weight and length of this one is perfect."
Won't take any other kind my daughter refuses lol
My baby loves these. I was given some as a gift ended up getting several more. It is helpful to have a few on hand. I tried a few other brands put these are baby boy's favorite. I breastfeed and found these to be good shape and caused no confusion. They are easy to clean with no extra parts that could fall off. They can be used with pacifier clips since they have a hole on the side of them. The ones for younger infants are softer.
ok
Very cute and nice quality. I bought these as a gift and was very happy with them.
is exactly what i expected
holds up like a tank after years of use and frequent washings.
love this product i have a blind child and its a wonderful toy for him.
excellent seat for my 11 month year old!
not as soft as bear and lamb.  nice music.
good quality! nice design. like zipper on back. lasted throughout mom and baby's needs.
cute
can't live without this stuff!! the best cleanup tool for poopy diapers!!
"bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it!! sit in it to read her books, drink her milk in the morning, watch her shows. she loves it and i do to. very well made, made in the usa. the only thing we had to assemble was putting the wooded rocker pieces on the bottom.. material is really nice and you can tell it was well made. not cheap looking at all."
product is very good.
"love them! great flushable poop catcher, way better than the other brand bumpkins we bought!"
a big hit a xmas. perfect fit to size. warm yet not so hot that they wake up hot. grandkids loved them
this product works exactly as described.
perfect & easy to assemble.
purchased as a gift for a dear friend; she loved it.
"i purchased this blanket for my now 4 year old before she was born.  the blanket is very soft and was perfect for a newborn, and my daughter still uses it to wrap and cover up her baby dolls. this blanket has withstood countless trips through the washing machine and dryer and still shows practically no signs of wear.  i'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this blanket."
so cute
super cute and a great price.
exactly what i needed!
great
precious and so soft.  i love it.
"this is a must have if you have a little one at home.  i have not  seen these sold at walmart, target, jewel, etc so consider investing in one before your baby gets sick.  you won't be able to run out to the local store to pick one up in desperate times.<br />this aspirator does not come with a filter - instead you can use tissue or toliet paper to block the mucus from entering the tube that leads to your mouth.  no worries that you'll end up with boogers in your mouth!<br />to use this, first sterilize all of the pieces with either a quick dunk in boiling water or the dishwasher.  put the pieces back together.  open the egg shaped part and put a loosely bunched tissue in.  close the egg shape container.  spray your little ones nose with a saline spray.  wait 30 seconds - 1 minute for the snot to soften.  have the mouth piece in your mouth and move the pointer (attached to the egg shape part) into the tip of the nose and suck gently.  repeat 2 to 3 times in necessary.<br />according to a conversation i had with my doctor, do not do this repeatedly throughout the day.  when they are sick, yes their noses are constantly be filled with mucus and it is possible to aggravate with the spray and aspirator.  try to do this before they eat, it will make eating a lot easier for them - they will be able to eat more and have less bubbles get into their system.  and before bed, so that it will be easier for the to fall asleep.<br />make sure that you clean after each use."
new aunt.
excellent sounds. easy to use.
love the kiinde system
"my wife bought this, i bought a different stroller thinking i knew better. my was wrong. my wife was right. this is durable and the most compact as i have seen yet for a double stroller for infants.  click-connect would be nice rather than straps, but not worth trading up in size or weight."
my grand nephew and his grandpa loved it.
"i have not used this bag just yet, i'm not due until end of april 2015, but based on the quality and space in the bag, it's awesome!  there are so many compartments to use for your personal items and of course for the baby.  it is very light weight and the handles are short so my husband can carry it by the handles or i can carry it on my shoulders.  there is also a longer strap where you can wear it cross-body or on the shoulder and the built in stroller straps are pretty neat.  they are velcro so i think that should make a strong hold when attached to the stroller.<br /><br />it's a stylish, yet functional, bag that i can't wait to use once my little one arrives!"
great
great for wine glasses once you are done with bottles
i absolutely love these diapers. i'm a first time mom (and a single one at that) and was nervous about all of time and effort needed for cloth diapers. these are the easiest things i have ever used and the fact that they are adjustable makes it even better. i had priced similar ones at buy buy baby and other places and these seem to be the best priced ones as well.
"i love this thing!! my son has had countless hours of fun since getting it from &#34;santa&#34; christmas morning. he is normally very active but refuses to nap for me-since he has been going in this he gets so tired he falls asleep. in two weeks his legs have become stronger, he's more vocal, and i really feel like he feels like he's more independent. super easy to put together-took less than 5 min. great buy!!!!"
awesome
love this back pack. it's cute factor is off the charts. it fits my 2yr old niece perfectly. i really like that it has a buckle on the front.
excellent
"works beautifully, quickly gets mucus out of infants."
"this lovely monster is the best friend of my daughter! easy to use it, trend bright colors, and the most importent thing-  i have no problems with snacks scattered around the house! daughter can not open the the cap itself, but soft monsters teeth make it easy to get cookies!"
great!
excellent looks great in crib
good
"this doesn't have much structure but works as an extended sun shade for our old model stroller that has a small sunshade.  yes, you need a sun shade to attached this too so say if you lost your shade for an infant carrier, this will not work to replace it."
"i was so excited when i saw this at my sisters that i decided to get one too. i love lion king so i thought this would be perfect for my little one. i wish it did come with a remote, but i can live without it."
love this bed! i got this for a second bassinet for our house and it is perfect! i love that the entire bassinet part is made of fabric and can be completely cleaned in the washing machine quickly and easily. the colors are so cute and my little one loves the hanging toys. our baby had reflux and can't lay flat to sleep and this bed has an incline that keeps him happy while he sleeps!
"good price, easy install."
beautiful frame. everybody love it!
"The one and only!  36 years ago our daughter was a pacifier pioneer.  This is the only kind she would take!  I have a young friend that I order these for her and after trying so many others, now it is the only kind her son will take!"
So cute!
"LOVE this wubbanub, the giraffe's neck means the pacifier can be positioned easier than some of the others."
"The item was given as a Christmas gift, the recipient is very happy with it."
Cute as can be!
The only kind my baby likes and they are adorable!  Small inside so it doesn't gag him :)
"Great paci, I'm LO loves it!!"
very goood
this little bear is so soft and cuddly. perfect size for my four month old. the color is a little lighter than in the picture. i like the actual color better than the one pictured. very happy.
great bib for any police officer to be. i wish they had more police officer related items like this. my son loves it and husband got a kick out of it.
omg talk about money well spent! i wasn't expecting that much when i purchased this pacifier but wow. the mustache part of the paci was made very well! almost like a soft silicone texture.
i love this! it fits perfectly on my changing table topper on the dresser i ordered. it's exactly what i expected... love it! would definitely recommend to a friend.
very good. sticks well and lots of colours
"so my 10mo old can use a straw cup but doesn't know how to tilt up a regular cup yet.  i think i've bought every one they make, so here's my review:<br /><br />nuby flip-n-sip: strong valve so no leaks, hard to suck.  she got frustrated very easily with this originally and i even find it hard to suck.  she doesn't seem to get these handles.<br /><br />munchkin click lock flip top: medium valve, no leaks, no handles which we seem to need. fairly easy suck. one of our go-to's for water.<br /><br />munchkin click lock straw: light valve, no leaks, no handles. easy suck. likes to chew on the straw. one of our go-to's for water.<br /><br />munchkin click lock weighted straw: light valve, no leaks (unless you don't screw lid on correctly), loves handles, likes to chew on the straw, weight works well. if you squeeze the straw while running water through the weight you can clean it pretty well.  comes with a straw cleaner.  i like that it's clear.  first cup she'll drink milk out of.  i think this is our favorite. sometimes i kind of prime it for her with the first drink. wish it had oz markings.<br /><br />zo-li bot straw: no valve but closed straw so easy suck, leaks only if tossed just right on the floor, dribbles a bit if on side otherwise (similar to nipple), easy to hold handles, comes with a straw cleaner.  she's not keen on milk in it but drinks water well. i like that it's clear and has oz markings.<br /><br />lollacup: no valve, open straw, easiest suck.  this is just a cup with a straw.  the straw may have a weight on it but it's short and stiff and doesn't move.  she likes it.  i haven't tried milk in it."
this the first time i've tried dry skin brushing. my skin feels much better.
like how these stand on their own. easy to use and write on.  freeze well
i purchased this for my britax car seat & it fits great. it is very easy to put on & take off. and it keeps my son very warm in this cold weather. it's so much easier than having to carry a blanket around with you.  i'm very happy with this purchase!
great product
great for traveling
my nephews 6 and 4yr old it!
been on two trips and so far so good. holds our chicco car seat and mountain buggy nano at the same time.
worth the price! :d
"chair works great, child must be buckled in chair, light weight and easy to travel with, would like to be able to ajust distance from table to baby may help child sit up and not slid down in seat. the dining tray is a good option to have, works great on our table."
i am very happy with the graco pack n play playard. so easy to set up. my daughter loves it as well. (i purchased it for her)
"easy to put on bath spout. verrry cute, love it!"
Ok
I was very skeptical when i bought this for my 4 month old who has started to teeth. He loves it! it is smaller than i bought it would be but it is just the perfect size for my little man. There is beeds in the feet but it dosnt bother me because it seems well put together.
These work great... Hospitals use them and they're the only pacifier my daughter would take.
We literally tried 7 different kinds of bottles and finally we found this one!! This is the one my daughter actually drank from!! She hated Dr. Browns. Please try this bottle if your child is not feeding well! I LOVE MAM bottles. Oh and make sure it has the vent system like these have. So much easier to clean than Dr. Browns too!! I can say enough how amazing these are!!!! My child finally ate again without choking or gagging.
Convenient and better than using the regular wipes on them
"We love our wubba nubs! They are perfect for newborns because they help to keep the pacifier in place and our now 7 month old loves it and can put it in on her own. They are so cute and easier to find in the dark or the diaper bag than a small pacifier. Our Ella Bella got torn from the soothie at day care and Mary Meyer replaced it for us for free. One of our favorite baby products, this is a great gift--adorable and so useful."
Perfect pacifier for my baby
I HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE ACCURATE AND EASY FOR MY SON'S GROWING FAMILY WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT.
"These are great, and my grandson loves them!  There is an entire menagerie of animals to choose from, but be aware that there are two different age groups for the pacifiers.  I would think that the added weight of the animal would be a problem, but so far it it not.  It makes it easier for parents to hold on to, also, and it doesn't fall out of baby's mouth so easily when they're sleeping."
Perfect for our 3 month old
"this is a beautiful starter bottle set. my baby loves the bottles, and i love them because they are easy to clean. my baby also prefers the pacis that come in this set to other name brands."
We initially bought some of these as a joke for my son but it turned out that they are the only ones he will use. Great price on Amazon and can't beat free two-day shipping (Prime). We constantly get compliments on them wherever we go!
The Philips AVENT Nighttime Infant it's a great pacifier.
Very good
"I love these pacifier wipes!  My daughter only used a pacifier for about 5 months, but I actually used these things for everything until she was almost 2 - toys that would fall on the ground, wiping down her high chair.  The thing I used them most for was wiping down my breast pump at work.  I'm not sure if this is recommended, but I felt comfortable doing it since these are food grade wipes.  I would pump 3 times at work, so after each session, I'd give all the parts a quick wipe down before storing them in my cooler.  I didn't have enough time to wash and sanitize everything each time, but since all sessions were completed within 6 hours, wiping them down and storing in a cooler was a good time saver and we never had a problem.  I'll be doing the same with my second, due in a few months!"
adorable
GOOD!!
It's an amazing product my daughter LOVES the lamb it's her favorite!!!!!
Worked great for my 7-month-olds!
I love it
This is the second WubbaNub I have purchased.  My son loves his WubbaNub so much and I've noticed having something on his chest gives him security at night and he loves to hold onto it.  The Bull is adorable too!
Great quality!
My newborn will only take the hospital style soothes and I was so glad to see these sold on Amazon. I love that they come in a pretty purple and pink color for her. :)
"exactly what i was looking for. no cutesy designs, just a good bib with an absorbent top, waterproof liner and a soft back. for droolers these bibs are a must. you can even tuck them under the clothing to keep the little one dry. the absorbent layer seems to wick moisture from the clothing and the soft under-layer is comfy against their skin. for kids with special needs who may have trouble managing their secretions (and drool a lot) these are a must."
well made. grandkids love it.
"our son sleeps in a sleep sack every night- this one is the perfect weight year round. not too heavy or too light. the way it zips makes it easy to get on and off, this is especially nice in the middle of the night. there is enough room for our son to kick his legs and be comfortable. seems to be good quality and holds together when washed. definitely would buy another one."
pretty awesome bed. my niece loves it. when she comes over she asks for her bed!!  very cute bed
very easy to put together! no tools needed. love it
cheap but does the job just right. easy to clean.
"love these. just like the one that was given to us by the hospital. just be aware that these are different than the 3+ month ones. the 0-3 month pacifiers are thinner, where as the 3+ month ones are tougher and thicker. my son loved his original hospital pacifier and i bought the 3+ month one as a replacement and he hated it."
"just as described.  my son-in-law loved it!  large enough to hold a big lunch, but not too big to carry easily."
"colorful, easy to setup, my baby loves it."
i love these bottles. the nipple is designed to be more like mothers breast vs other nipple that are straight. great for babies that are breast-fed. i also like that fact that you can transition it to a sippy cup with a handle and sippy nipple/top as they grow.
"this was my second ergo.  the first one lasted daily use for about 3 years with two different kids.  i wouldn't even take it off while driving and i think the seatbelt rubbing on it shortened its life.  (i had taken the kid out while driving)  so i bought this one 3 years ago and we are still going (on kid number 3).  it is life changing.  i tried a sling and it just didn't work for me, but this does.  i got the infant insert and used it when they were little, and then moved up to using it without the insert and then on the back too. i love it."
good
great!
this was for my grandson and it was absolutely the hit of his christmas gifts.  absolutely adorable.  soft and cuddly.  so glad i ordered it.
i  love the lamp shade but i was expecting the whole lamp.<br />my fault for not reading the description right
my granddaughter loves mickey mouse so this was the perfect size table and chair set for her.
my 6 month old ate her first solid food with these spoons and had no issues eating the whole serving of food. she also liked to chew on the spoon and tried to hold it herself.
excellent
"my son loves his pillow; very soft, and perfect size. it's his first pillow, so we're very pleased. great quality; hasn't even stained from toddler drool :"
this is so cute
the little i got this for loved it.
this has been a great bag for us. the colors are neutral and not too girly or too manly. the compartments are varied and useful. it has held up pretty well for the past year that we have used it. we love it.
super super super no issues
Perfect. Daugher in Law likes these to keep the different baby sizes separate.
"We love these and have a couple of them!  If baby drops the pacifier it doesn't go bouncing across the room!  Also, these are harder to drop as they just kind of stay in place better than a lone paci.  My two month old can almost wrap his arm around the reindeer and keep the paci in place, or if it pops out he can work it back in because it stays near.  I wasn't really sold on these until I used them, now they are a must have!"
Love these for our twin girls they only will use these and no others.
Smells like vanilla my son loved this thing for weeks!!!
Baby liked this brand best. Glow in the dark would help us both find them in his crib at night.
"Very cute and excellent quality, although my son never used it (he never took to a dummy/pacifier)."
The only pacifiers my son ever liked. The same as the one he got from Lucille-Packard Children's Hospital.
My son loves his WubbaNub so much I had to share with others and purchased this one for a gift.  I've noticed having something on his chest gives him security at night.
Item arrived on time and product quality was great!
These have been necessary for our baby.  Love them!
Great price and fast shipping
I refused to use pacifiers with my oldest.  She quickly found her thumb and I have had a hard time breaking her of the habit.  When my next baby was born I turned to pacifiers to alleviate thumb sucking and the damage is does to the mouth and teeth.  These are the only pacifiers we have used.  I am constantly ordering to replace ones that are lost.
Baby made it his favorite.
really cute gift idea for baby shower to put on top of gift!!!
good gift item
so cute
Best pacifier ever! My son finally slept through the night with this pacifier ( and I tried A LOT of pacifiers). The glow in the dark are a must have for bed time. He can find his pacifier in the dark and can reinsert it without me having to get out of bed. Its also great when you have to go in for the dream feed to find them without turing on the light.
"Cute!  Wish my baby would take it, though!"
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect
"quite reliable and easy to operate.  no problems so far.  i like the minimal set of features, without the lullabies/temperature b**l.  very nice it has wall mounting option."
"a very pretty floppy hat, perfect"
"i bought this for my daughter & son-in-law & they love it, however, there was no manual or any instructions included in the box, which is kind of a pain as now we have to track them down online & print them so we know how to set it up & fold it up."
grand son said no no pee
i love how tall the head part raises.
item was as described and i am extremely happy that the item was received on or before the promised day.
"one of my granddaughters theme is ladybugs.  i purchased this night light for use in her nursery.  mom and dad haven't used it yet.  i really like the light.  it is a bit larger than i expected.  if you look at the posted photo, you can see the size as compared to the plate on the plug."
"awesome, thank you"
"best sippy cups we have used yet.  they do not leak, unless shaken upside down like a salt shaker.  they have a rubbery nozzle that toddlers/infants tend to like.  it holds a lot but is manageable enough to control for a little one.  i would definitely buy again."
great
this is a really good cover for the price. would recommend this on an older baby. hook and loop has remained sticky for five months and there have been no leaks with this cover.
"so far we love it. it looks just like the picture. it took me over an hour, maybe closer to 2 to assemble with a drill. feels pretty study."
the temperature / thermometer reader on this was so helpful when baby was an infant!!!  great idea!
looks awesome
"my daughter has been using this as a baby bag (for her daughter) for almost a year.  it is sturdy and has heck of a lot of pockets and room.  i get lost using it every time.  too many pockets for my 49 year old brain.  this bag has come on road trips and grocery store trips, to the babysitters and thrown in the back of the car.  it has stood up to our abuse... so far.  :)"
"this crib is great quality and i like the dark cherry color. we made sure to order the conversion kits so that we have them for the future. i also found that this glider chair has cherry wood that matches the bed, which was convenient. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00l40sgqa/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=utf8&psc=1<br /><br />we also purchased this dresser which matches perfectly and is also good quality.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0069209fy/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1"
son loved this!  great colors
"amazing! my son was potty trained, but wouldn't use a toilet, just his little potties. we took this thing everywhere. now we just keep it in the car for emergencies."
"easy to clean, lightweight, doesn't get too dirty.  recommended!"
"these diapers are super cute. they started fitting my baby when he was about 9 lbs, and the patterns are just stinking adorable. they're very soft to the touch. i love that they have all snaps and no velcro. they're a good start to a cloth diaper collection.<br /><br />these sometimes leak around the leg seams, but it may be an issue of my son's shape. i'm not certain yet - we'll see as he gets bigger. for now, i recommend them."
it did it's job kept my grandson busy
helps me keep my milk organized in the fridge. great idea!
great
"fits nice, washes well and soft for baby."
"omg i love these inserts. they are so soft. they work as an insert or a liner, either way they are great. love them."
"i bought this pack n play to keep at my house for my grandbabies. i love the diaper changing table, it comes off very easily it doesn't fold over like most pack n plays. that is a nice feature."
this gate has held up well with almost one year of heavy use. the gate is easy to open and doesn't rip off the wall like the other gate we have. i highly recommend this high quality gate.
"i love these things -- have one for each of my two, a 10 month old and a 2.5 year old.  it hides the extra floor food until sweeping time, food unsticks more easily, and it keeps stuff from getting tracked all over and ground in.  also protects the rug under my table, which isn't a huge deal because you a) can't see most of the rug due to splat mat presence and b) it's a cheap rug anyway.  but it looks much better without tons of blueberry, banana and avocado smeared into it.  i really like these."
perfect
great. thank you.
it keeps my grandson busy for a long time.
VERY clear picture!
I  love these bottles! I will be ordering more bigger ones when its time
Perfect
Great condition! Exactly what we wanted.
Perfect
everything was perfect
good
"Everything I expected! Soft to to the touch, and it's now my daughter's favorite of her collection"
"Awesome gift set, was very happy with my purchase."
I love the design of these and wanted my baby to love them too but we have tried other pacifiers and he just won't take them.  Guess our baby isn't a pacifier baby but that is okay because that is one less thing to wean him off of!
Great binkie. My 3 month Old sucks it while grabbing the reindeer. So cute. Easy to take out and wash too!
"my little neice loves it and if she be happy, so am I."
Perfect
"Perfect for a little boy! Similar to the Nuk pacifiers (6-18 month) usually used by him, so he took it with no problem. That made me really happy because it is so funny!"
Great way to keep the paci around without constantly loosing it.
I had one of these for my 18 month old and she loved it. So upon the arrival of our new baby I just knew we had to have another one and now I can't leave home without it.
They really do glow in the dark. Very fun!
Great paci. Our son has loved this since he was an infant. We liked that he could find it if it fell out in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Only bad thing is that he's super attached to &#34;Monk&#34; and will be a difficult habit to break :)
Amazing product.
My grand baby loves it
Loved this! Fast shipping!/
Very satisfied.
Don't know what it is about the WubbaNubs but my baby niece won't take any other pacifiers. This is the fifth one I buy for her. The attached toys seem to enchant to the baby and the shape of the pacifier itself seems to perfectly fit her little mouth.<br />The toys can be detached after the baby stops using the pacifier so... it's a good buy.<br />I definitely recommend.
"My son loved this, fast shipping"
perfect
"Very cute pacifiers, made a great stocking stuffier for my son."
Awesome
great fun gift for a shower !!!
have purchased two so far.  my nieces love them for their babies.
worked great.  created one for our new puppy and one for my 6 & 8 yr old daughters. after reading the reviews about cracking i decided to place a damp paper towel on it as it began to dry.  it is drying perfect!
"it is very sweet and cute, and soft. and it plays very well. and it arrived in good time, and in excellent condition. the pull cord is made very well and if used properly will last forever."
"this was a last minute impulse buy before our baby was born, we wanted something to put the baby in that would allow him to stay in the same room as us if needed. we never imagined how much we'd depend on it, taking it with us whenever we travel somewhere with the baby and he sleeps better in it than his crib right now so he gets to rest in it when he's having a rough night. we've used it for two months now with no issues."
"i love these! we do blw and they are perfect for my 7 month old to start with self feeding. i give applesauce on the blue one and yogurt on the orange one. they work so much better for begginers than regular spoons. i have actually purchased two sets. they do discolor slightly, but that is not a big deal."
love this product! it fits perfectly with my medela pump parts so i can pump directly into the avent natural bottles. the only bottles my daughter will take. no leakage-i've only used it with the sealing ring though. and for those of you with a hygeia pump-you can use the medela flange ect and just use the hygeia tubes and use this product as well!
"the recipient of these was very happy with them. she is breast-feeding and feels these work much better than the ones more easily accessible in general stores like walmart, cvs, target."
"use it to keep cats in back bedroom area when necessary. works much better than the narrower ones i tried before, which they were able to open."
my 3 month old son loves this mobile.  i only purchased it from the reviews and everyone was right!  entertains him for 30 mins while i get the eight zillion other things done that need tending to around the house.  it's 100% worth the money.
it's an awesome car seat. i like how sturdy this seat is. the only thing i don't like is its easy to open top buckle for a toddler. but on flip slide easy for me too
great product
i got this for my grandson to play with while i feed him. he loves it. it figured out how to make it spin around. happy with my purchase.
safe way to travel
good
"bought this for my newest grandbaby ( momma ) he's now 4 months and he really enjoys his play time. he rolled over and discovered the mirror, such a precious smile came"
"i love the symphony pump, and this was much less than purchasing with the rental. i'm a nicu mom, 12 weeks pumping and not nursing- so this was the best pump out there."
very good product and goo price.
"it is so good that i actually bought two. i kept one at bedroom and another one in living... good product, serves the purpose pretty well."
the owl and its baby were a big hit with my grand-niece. it turned out to be the perfect gift.
"these are awesome! so light and soft, great for babies/toddlers in warmer weather."
this wrap is amazing. this is my third baby and nothing compares to the quality and convenience of this wrap! the fabric is sooo soft and it took me no time at all to figure out how to wrap my baby in it properly. i've been using it for two months and am considering getting another because i love it so much. you won't regret buying it!
great grand baby saws thanks saves mommy messes
love these bottles! my daughter is 2 months old and will drink from them without any problems. she is just starting to outgrow the stage 1 nipples so will be purchasing the stage 2 ones soon. i have the stage 2 classic but i like the naturals better because i think it's easier to switch from breastfeeding to bottle because of how the nipple is shaped. they promote breastfeeding and have anti colic anti gas function as well.
so much fun!
great product. thanks!
exactly what we were looking for.  we have a big hallway but wanted to be able to keep the dog out of certain areas.  only complaint is the instruction to install where little hard to follow.
these are super soft and unnoticed. i'm a first time mom so breast feeding was a whole new ball game i love these definitely recommend hold up great in the wash machine.
excellent
perfect compact gate to keep my dog securely in my kitchen.
very practical and durable
"very good customer service! there are believers and non believers that this works. i think it's what you think will help your child. teething is a very uncomfortable period, i'm willing to try this if it helps even a little bit!"
love these bibs !  colors are bright and 2 year old loves both colors. attachment works well and is easy to fasten with one hand. really good product. big pocket works well and all is easy to clean under tap. very satisfied !
"i love this wall decal in my daughter's room!  it looks so absolutely adorable, and it sticks to the wall very well.  we actually just went through a move, and with smart packing this decal was easy to re-stick to a new wall!  my daughters room was boring and white, but we lived in a rental so i could not do anything permanent to the walls.  after sticking this decal on the wall, my daughter's room had life!  i was so impressed with the difference it made, and i got tons of compliments from other mothers wondering where i got it.  i would recommend this product to anyone who wants their child's room to look like an adorable enchanted forest."
excellent
exactly what the original package came with. our son got a hold of it too many times and knocked it off his crib. so we needed a replacement for the one that broke. picture and sound are great. a great buy for us being new parents and having an infant down the hall.
these are perfect for our daughter. i love that the handle glows in the dark.
i have been taking pictures every month. it's so nice to see the monthy growth.
lovingly ordered for my first granddaughter.
"i love this diaper bag.  it fits a lot of stuff and looks cuter than most of the loud patterned bags out there.  i love all the little pockets and places to put stuff, but i do need to be careful to remind myself regularly of what's in there because it's easy to forget.  a nice feature is the pacifier pouch on the side, which i use regularly.  the straps to hook the bag onto a stroller are nice too.  overall, very happy with my purchase!"
"i am obsessed with hello kitty, and having a daughter tends to make me buy more things with hello kitty. i love this activity cube and it will definitely keep her preoccupied when she gets bigger."
fantastic all natural toothpaste! my toddler loves it!
"we purchased this thinking it would be great for our daughter as a first pillow. the pillow is very clearly high quality and very soft, but my daughter moves around a lot in her sleep so we found she kept rolling off the edge of the pillow because it is so poofy, and she didn't stay still in her sleep long enough to get it broken in to make it less poofy. i decided to steal it to use as a travel pillow for long car rides and on the airplane and i love it! even if you find you can't use it for your child at night, it still makes a great travel pillow and is worth the money! we haven't had to wash it yet, but it looks like it will be very easy to wash and keep clean when the time comes."
My daughter loves it !! This product is so great. My baby loves biting on the monkey itself. This also helps keeping the soother in her mouth when she is try to sleep. I am ordering another one.
"Both of my children used WubbaNub.  I love how easy it is to locate in the room by finding the plush toy.  When it gets dirty, I throw it in the washing machine and then let it air dry.  After it is dry, I clean and sanitize the pacifier in the bottle warmer.  I like to buy this pack of three to give out to all of my friends who are expecting.  It is the perfect gift."
Fits 2 Soothie pacifiers perfectly. At first my husband didn't like the extra bag but it truly does make finding a pacifer in a hurry easier. And the fact that it snaps means we can quickly switch between bags.
This is incredibly adorable and very durable. It says 0-6 months but it works fine for my 2 year old.
this is the best nuggey anyone ever made my granddaughter is Two and she won't suck on any other pacifier so I bought her 17 this Christmas I wish you would come down in price but they are the best Staten Island New York lady rider
"My daughter loves them. We get compliments from everyone about them. She will not use anything else. I can leave one in her diaper bag, one at home, and one at grandma's. We LOVE wubbanub!"
Cute little bag! Love that it's made in the USA. The waterproof material on the inside is of much better quality than any other waterproof style bag I've had.
"These are the best bottles ever. Easy to clean, the bottom can be taken apart for deep clean. This is a very nice set."
Good pacifiers!
"It can fit two Philips Avent Soothie Pacifiers, stacked. Nice big handle with one open end to bend and fit easily around anything, purse handle, baby links, car seat handle."
Love these! The only orthodontic pass that doesn't get mold in it!!
"I love that they glow in the dark, so they are easy to find in the crib at night."
wonderfully
hilarious!
"this is a great idea, but a litttle too big for my 2 year old"
i bought this as a gift on the registry. the recipient had used one in a previous pregnancy and was looking forward to using this again. she said it was very durable and held everything easily. the backpack idea kept her hands free so she could deal with her little one.
so cute
This is a really cute pacifier for a baby boy. The nipple is securely sewn to the stuffed animal and doesn't fall off. Stuffed animal is soft and squishy so baby loves to hug and squeeze. Nipple is comparable to soothies' &#34;newborn&#34; pacifier in regards to firmness.
great!!
Adorable!! I first heard about these on a youtube when watching videos on baby essentials for my unborn niece/nephew.<br /><br />I couldn't resist the reindeer; he's adorable. I love the fact that young babies can easily put this back in their mouths if they lose it during the night. I hope baby likes it when it arrives.
great

Love it !
BEST ITEM IVE EVER BOUGHT for my baby... she cant live without it. super soft and stays on her chest when the paci slips out of her mouth.
Best investment ever.  My son loves his monkey and it holds up great. Does great in the washer. I have 3 of them for him so we can interchange them.  Love that we never lose it and that it allows my son to manipulate it to sooth himself. Highly recommend!!!
"These are my son's favorite pacifiers! He is 2 now, and this is the brand he has liked since he was a newborn.  They're really cute and they hold up to boiling well, if only we could keep from loosing them!"
These are wonderful!!
Haven't used it but cute as a button.
"I was a bit skeptical about this product early on in baby's life as it seemed hard for her to keep it in her mouth, not to mention she preferred the Nuk brand more. However, I became a convert around the five month mark when I started putting baby to sleep with this guy in her crib and found that she was able to find the pacifier when it fell out thanks to the critter attached. I even went so far as to buy another one because it was working so well. Even though my daughter is now almost eight months, we still use these as her 'night-time' pacifiers for the reason above. Not to mention I think she finds comfort even in holding onto the animal even if the pacifier is out of her mouth. Another idea I read about in a magazine is to cut the pacifier off when you are trying to wean baby. This still allows them to have something familiar and cozy, but the paci is gone. Food for thought!"
Love these pacifiers! The nipple is so sturdy and my daughter loves it!
My baby's favorite pacifiers since he was a newborn. Great fit - and like that is comes with 4 because all pacifiers are easy to lose.
This is the cutest pacifier.  It is well made and adorable!
Exactly what I was looking for! I wanted to match the pacifier that was given to us in the hospital as the nipple was similar to the nipple shield we were using as well (trying to avoid any nipple confusion!). These were exactly the same as the pacifiers we received in the hospital.
REALLY cute and good quality.
"This is one of the pacifiers we got in the hospital with my first son after buying all Dr. Browns pacifiers. He would not take anything else except for Nuks... We couldn't find them in store except on Amazon... The same exact thing happened with my second son, we will never buy a different brand!"
"Well made, item is so cute."
worth every penny! we also have the formula pro.. great timesaver!
These Wubbanub pacifiers are hands down my favorite.  The little animal on the end is cute and soft and makes finding the pacifier easy in low light.  It also makes it easy for the child to find too.  I highly recommend!
Thanks
They are pacifiers and they worked as pacifiers.  :-)
"These are the best pacifiers and everyone I know who uses them says their kids love them as well.  I get a kick out of watching them used by either way, our daughter loved the little stuffed animal on the end.  Also, it helps make them a little larger which is nice since its easier to keep an eye on them.  I don't love the look of the rubber pacifier without the animal either."
"My first daughter used Nuk pacis but I had to buy a different brand for my new baby as per my pediatrician's recommendation so as not to confuse her. These are great. They fit well in his mouth, he can hold it easily, and the designs are cute."
Baby's favorite pacifier
This tiger is by far the softest WubbaNub. The 'hairs' under the ears are a great texture for little hands. The legs are larger than other ones we have had. Highly recommend &#34;Tigee&#34;.
Great paci holder. You can fit two of any brand inside. Attaches well to your bag and great design.
This brand is the best pacifier in the whole entire world.  My child loves them and they are easy to keep up with since the puppy makes it such a large item.  It is wonderful.
very good
Chosen because they are all silicone but I keep getting more because they seem to be my son's favorites.
These have saved our sanity. I bought these after they were recommended by a friend and I received a single pack at my baby shower. I've since purchased several because we are always losing them or dropping them and we MUST have one on hand for our little guy. These are very soothing to him and not too big for his mouth. He has been using them since he was 1 month old and is now almost 11 weeks- still loves them. They are cute and neutral blue and green- could really be used for a boy or girl. The best part is that they are orthodontic so they won't cause him any damage.
I love it it was a great gift for my little one
Excellent Item.
"These are wonderful, I buy the glow in the dark ones for all my first time parent friends!"
I get stopped by everone to laugh at my 9 month old!  It is clever and adorable!
I bought this for a baby and got shot the next day.<br /><br />It was perfect!!
"good product, good delivery time, fair price"
My daughter is in love with these she won't use any other type of pacifier (she's only 3 months) and we've been using these since she was about 2 weeks. Also the handles glow in the dark which is super great for rolling over when she drops it and being able to see it in the dark.
So cute
This is my 7 week old baby's favorite pacifier.  He only likes these! Highly recommended.
I honestly expected to get two binkies. I got four. So that was a pleasant surprise. (:
"Took the baby a bit to adjust to this pacifier. It's longer than most, but very very soft. He loves it now to help him sleep most nights."
"Met expectations, it os so much easier to get an accurate temperature."
Great for in the car so you can reach behind you and locate the pacifier if it falls out. Doubles as a toy for your baby too. The only downside is you cannot wash or sterilize the pacifier.
Amazing
Favorite binky by far.  In fact our first one(which our dogs loved also...) was so great that we ordered a second after it was defluffed by the dogs.
Love the new WubbaNub. My 8 month old daughter loves the elephant since there are many places for her to grab and easily put back into her mouth.
"Loved it for my baby, kept air out of his mouth."
NUK Pacifiers are the best ever! I have tried other brands and my girls only like these ones!
"Our son loves his wubbanuber!! He loves the soothie pacis so we had to try this. Not only is it cute, but it's very useful. It helps keep the pacifier near his mouth, so when he's done sucking it doesn't fall to the floor. To wash it I just use the pink bucket we left the hospital with and put a little soap and water and clean it by hand. It holds up well. My son spits up a lot so we have to wash it often. It does say you can machine wash in a mesh bag, but we haven't tried that yet. I don't want it to fall apart and we are without his favorite nubber. We will try after he gets his new one from Santa. I might update then."
"Good quality, I like it."
Our 2 month old has loved these pacifiers since birth. We bought the 6 pack so we could have them in the diaper bag and around the house at all times. Super helpful.
So cute!  I gave it as part of a baby shower gift & the new mom loved it!
"First off, these will only glow if you expose them to light for a while first. Same as any other glow in the dark product. I love the mam pacifiers because my son showed strong favor to them when he was only a month old. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with novelty pacifiers with mustaches and funny sayings. These fit perfectly in baby's mouth no matter how which direction it goes in. Once the baby learns how to put their pacifier in their mouths, it's easy for them to do and since they glow in the dark, it's easy to find in the crib at night. I'm not a fan of the clear ones because they're hard for him to find. To the reviewer who said the pacifiers make her baby drool, that's like saying a specific diaper makes your baby poop. Babies drool. It's a fact of life. Get over it. Also, do yourself a favor and purchase the mam pacifier clips. They're the only ones that work with mam pacifiers."
good
Works great. Easy to wedge in place near our baby so he can suck on it but soft and squishy enough it's not something he chokes on when he barfs.
perfect holder for on the go
Our daughter loves these . They have become her best friend.
Excellent!
Perfect
"We love this product! There is no better binkie than natural rubber! Our daughter actually lost her first one at the store, and her heart was broken. I ordered one online right away, and got it in a couple days. Thank you!"
My husband went to UT so this was perfect.
"These pacifiers are the best on the market! Especially when you're trying to find it in the dark, or making sure it's still in your baby's mouth while out walking around after dark."
Best thing ever!
Perfect
"My daughter used these pacifiers until she was a year old. She loved them, I liked that they are all natural. The only bummer was they are a bit expensive so I was a bit obsessed with not losing them. We used a pacifier chain to keep tabs on it. They also need to be replaced after a bit. Still, my daughter loved them so I can't complain."
These are wonderful. My baby loves them and they are beautiful. I like the fact that they glow in dark and makes it easier to find in the crib at night time.
Great quality!
Love them
Cute pacifiers and my grandson likes them
Makes life so easy since these glow in the dark!
The paci's are perfect but I do wish I could pick the colors.
Perfect for Daddy's girl
Love them
"So easy to wash, wider base has helped to rid of nipple confusion; which is a huge deal for breast feeding mommas!"
My baby loves this thing! He really really loves this thing! Thanks a lot!
"love these. makes losing pacifiers so much harder, finding them so much easier, but when they are lost more expensive to replace."
Great product
Gift recipient had this on her wish list which made it an easy buy.  Product seems to be on a lot of mother's shower lists.  If they don't this would make an excellent choice if you're searching for ideas
my sweet baby cant get enough of this doll so soft
works great for my niece
i'm so glad i have this. i know i would lose much more sleep were it not for the reassurance of the snuza.
perfect for cute little faces!
"very satisfied with the height, esthetics's, and the availability to make this gate a permanent fixture if desired."
they are for my son's new baby comiing in april so i can't really say how they like it.  but it looks like he will get great use of it because he lives in florida and baby doesn't need a sunburn when out with dad.
great condition!
"love how simple the pacifier is and how its wide plate allow us to put it on any surface and it won't tumble easily. also it doesn't easily fall down from baby's mouth if he's lying flat and face facing up since the weight of the pacifier is just nice not too heavy not too lightweight. simple design, easily washed (i boil it in hot water to wash). my baby does not immediately suck the pacifier so we have to hold it between his lips first and then he'll take his time before he properly sucks the soothie."
these are fun!
works fine on the uppababy g-luxe.
nice
"great feel. i have large fingers and when i finally look at my finished product after typing, i'm amazed at the jibberish i produced. now with my new stylus, i'm saving time. it feels great in your hand and you tap and not push like you would with the rubber tipped stylus. thanks to joto, i'm now able to jot down what i mean instead of hope and wish i'm accomplishing something."
"good quality.  fits my one year old well, and will grow with him.  snaps are great."
very sweet works great
i use this to check on baby when i'm at a stop light. i can see her very clearly.
"cute picture on the mat and large enough to cover a good portion of the table in front of the child.  it sticks well, but can be pulled up at the edges by a child if they are determined.  i just like having something clean to put the food on rather than the table top."
perfect!  thank you
"one of the best safety door knobs for 2 plus year old. i have a 2.5yr old n he hasn't figured out how to use it yet, thank god."
good buy
my granddaughter loved it!
Sight and sound allows for peace of mind while still being able to monitor adults who cannot be left alone.
"I decided to try out these bottles after discovering that MAM pacifiers are the only ones my daughter will actually suck on. She's mostly breastfed, but when I need to work/do appointments, I use these so others can feed her formula or pumped breastmilk. It always takes her a minute to get used to drinking from it, but it's the only bottles where she isn't constantly sucking air along with the milk. I like that this package comes along with two pacifiers, too, since it seems like I'm constantly misplacing/washing them."
very lightweight. my daughter is really picky about pacifiers.. the MAM pacifiers and soothies have been the only ones I could get to work.. finally a pacifier I can use to attach to her so it doesn't get lost!
Super cute and shipped very fast! Thank you :)
This is the best. No more lost pacifier. My son loves to hold it and can easily put it back in his mouth.
Our baby loves these and won't use the gummy pacifiers any more.
Great!
cute gift!
Our twin sons love these.  They are our 'mute' buttons :)  We've ordered multiple packs of these and don't leave home without them (we didn't really use pacifiers with our daughter but they've been very helpful with the twins).
Love
"My Daughter is 3 months old (formula fed). We use these as  well as the Medela bottles and she seems to be a little less gassy with these. At first I was concerned about the nipple shape (it is not round, its more like a squished oval), but she likes the MAM pacifiers so we decided to give it a try.<br />She likes them! They are also very easy to clean the bottoms actually screw off as well as the tops and you can sterilize them in the microwave without using a bag or other sterilization contraption."
good
Cute.  Wife had to have it.  Great present for the new arrivals.
The adorable animal keeps the paci in my baby's mouth until she can put it there herself.  The paci part is just like the ones they had at the hospital so baby had no problem transitioning.  She also likes chewing on the soft animal part.  We had no problem throwing them in the washing machine either.
these are fantastic!  they are really substantial and rugged.  they absolutely stay put.  really great buy.
"this stuff is amazing!! i used it to strip diapers and it worked amazingly. so much mixed information on how to use it, so i'd research carefully depending on your machine type, number of diapers, type of issues, etc.<br /><br />once i worked out the magic combination for me, it was great!<br /><br />helped remove build up, minerals, smell, etc."
love love love!! i was wishing to find this product one day while exclusively pumping! and i just love them! i highly recommend this product line!
"i have two lean little boys, who had a constant problem with &#34;droopy bottoms&#34;. the dapper snapper was a perfect solution. it helps keep their pants up with out having to be unbuckled every time i change their diapers. great design!"
"this system is a real time saver!!! you really need the bags, bottles, bottle warmer and nipples. the storage tray i didnt find very necessary, but it is still more economical to buy the set to start you out. it is a great way to pump and feed for a working mom."
the handles are easy for my baby to hold and i like to use it for bananas when we are out and about.
this is my second safari friends lunch box.  both my kids have used these since age 15 months.  they are very durable and very easy for little hands to work and figure out.  and very cute designs!
"great price, they love it"
great product!!!
everything is perfect and it shipped fast! thank you my kids are going to love these!
this is amazing and such a help and time saver for twins!!!  highly recommend!
"looked all over for these bibs, catches the mess nicely and the kids don't mind them on. they are soft but work well."
"worth the money lovey. very soft, quite lovable and my grand children still love them all even the threadbare ones."
great!
"great quality product! love the brushes, they work the best so far with the ones i've tried."
twins are not yet born - but the item is perfect compared to one having to be in front and one in back (not a fan of those) and easier to use!
very pretty. a perfect extra to decorate my granddaughters new bedroom.
"love this bag and the color and ordered from elephantearsonline, they have great customer service (i've ordered from them before). i'm not sure if it was them or amazon who packaged the bag though because the packaging got seriously bent from the outside and, as a result, the bottom of the bag was bent as well. it's kind of reshaped itself after being stuffed and stored and amazon worked with me to resolve the issue. the sashay is a great bag, this is the second one i have right now (but i have had a total of five of them; i have a #petuniaproblem)--form and function works well for moms and any time you might have to carry more stuff and would like to at least have the option of being hands free. the *only* things i would caution on are 1. shallow outer bottle pockets 2. it's a deep bag so you need to figure out a system to organize it. personally ppb powder room cases are a favorite of mine and i would recommend those as well."
to early christmas isn't here yet
cute and very warm
"cute bag. i gave it 5 stars because the price is so cheap, especially for a winnie the pooh item with a very cute print.<br />because it was so cheap, i wasn't expecting much. it's just a simple bag, nothing fancy, no inside pockets, just &#34;bands&#34; on the inside to tuck things into like diapers. the outside has the pouches for storage.<br />my only problem was the bag is actually pretty blue in color and you can't really tell from the picture how blue it is. light blue, a baby blue color, but not nearly as &#34;white&#34;/blue as the picture seems, i actually thought it would be white it is very blue."
the product is solid. fit well. stay tied and keep baby's feet warm...and soft organic.
grandson loved it
"i love everything about this seat except it's weight. it is a tank so difficult to carry around and put in multiple cars. however, it's ease of installation makes it ideal for various cars so...it's a contradiction. i can tell you though since buying a evenflo sureride for grandmas car and a diono rainier for my husband's that they are all cumbersome and difficult to install so if they are all going to be a pain to carry then you might as well have one that's easy to install and to install properly."
awesome! it works!
love it  fast delivery
perfect gift for my godchild and she loves it while playing dress. got it in 2013 for xmas and it still looks brand new from daily play dress up. she was three and is going on five. great gift for the busy child!!!! assembly is what her dad does!!!! no nicks or scratches even today.
"love! my baby is almost 6 months old now. i started with the breastfeeding gift set after research and reviews. the baby switched from breast to nipple and never had a problem. i have never had a bag leak! the direct pump is wonderful when you are half asleep and stressed with your newborn. the bags store nicely in the fridge and freezer and transport great in freezer packs. the costs of the bags seem to be moderate. the warming system, the kozi is a must! it never failed me at all hours of the night. everyone asks me what bottle system i have and i cannot boast enought about this. the pump adapters fit my medela perfectly with no leakage! best bags! best one handed bottle system! quick and safe warming system! you can't go wrong!"
great!!!
very nice and so soft. i like it cause it is a little bigger then the normal baby blankets.
great quality product! very cute and they don't leak!
"Fantastic Product! We have had this for several months and the overall quality is outstanding. Excellent picture, features and battery life."
This is my son's favorite.
Great
Wonderful pacifiers! Love this brand!
My sons favorite pacifier! :)
Great pacifiers!
"Just as described, best to get a clip to attach to these as they hop all over the floor in which i lost many of them."
after 6 mo these are very good. stick them in the freezer as use as a teether ;)
So cute
Great product!
"Love these pacifiers, they are nice and small so they don't over consume the baby's entire face."
I simply loves this pacifiers. Very easy to sterilize them.
Cute colors
good
These are great!!!!
Good
I just love the look and they are easy to clean. My three month has no issue going from nipple to bottle.
This pacifire is so cute . cant wait to buy more !!
Great deal for pacis.  Different designs yet still girlish as well
"We love &#34;wubbies&#34; and get a new one for each baby and every baby shower as a gift to friends. The Wubbanub is the ONLY paci you should get. They're easy to find in the dark when you're fumbling around the crib, same goes for the carseat when you're doing the reach around while driving trying to calm a screaming kid. Best yet is that kiddos can start to get it into their OWN mouth unassisted much easier. Most hospitals use Soothi paci's anyway so this is an easy transition and the nipple shape and design is similar to the Dr. Brown's shape for those using them and worried about too much nipple confusion.<br /><br />My favorite design thus far is the dragon, adorable!"
So adorable and perfect for Christmas!  Thank you!
"My baby loves them.... Good time on shipment, very good quality..."
Good product
Great pacifiers besides that the baby loves them. I love them. Because when it's dark in his room and he's yelling and I just need to find his pacifier and put it back in his mouth and can't find it.  But now with the glow in the dark it makes it much easier to find!
"LOVE IT!! 8 MONTHS LATER ITS STILL AS GOOD AS NEW, I WASH IT BY HAND ONCE EVER 7-10 DAY WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DREFT AND DAB OF BLEACH... SOAK IT AIR DRY IT (OR BLOW DRY IT IF I NEED IT FASTER)<br />dEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS... BUY 2!!!!  I DIDN'T, BUT WHILE ONE IS DRYING WIT WOULD HAVE MADE LIFE SO MUCH EASIER TO HAVE A SECOND ONE!  BUY THIS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! FOR YOUR BABY OR A GIFT, INEXPENSIVE, BUT WOULD MAKE AN AMAZING SHOWER GIFT!!"
"Love these. Keeps pacifiers clean and easy to locate in the diaper bag. I've never used the clip handle, so i'm not sure about it's durability."
fit perfect in my baby's koi pink play yard :)
fits perfectly the cameleon bugaboo stroller. very good quality. love the options to use either the fleece cover or the duvet cover. seems very comfortable and very warm. baby looks super happy! i can only wish something like that existed when i was a baby.
good to train kids it's comfortable
it's hard to find these bottles anywhere!  and this is such an awesome price!!!
"so far so good. no leaks, small setting fits perfectly on my newborn (7lbs-12oz) and poo easily wipes off if when i am changing him some accidentally gets on the cover."
so much room and such style! i love using this bag. it holds all the essentials plus extras. i adore the stroller straps but worry about how heavy the bag may be...i will update as time goes on. so far the bag has held up perfect!
such a cute theme! my daughter is going to love it for her new room decor!
good product -- served its purpose well.
"after our 1st week with this car seat, we are beyond satisfied. our taller than average 2 year old rides super comfortably and best of all, he sleeps soundly without any head flopping forward issues. very satisfied!"
"if i could do 10 stars, i would!!  the customer service is just absolutely awesome.  i needed these asap so i contacted the seller and got an email within the hour. once the details were discussed and decided upon, it really was shipped out immediately. the mittens themselves really are bigger than the newborn ones. and they're soft and cute. wish i bought these earlier!"
"practical, looks good and the baby loves it..."
"so far love this stroller!  its definitely heavy to carry, but its a smooth ride for the kids! im very happy with this!"
great car seat. easy to install. my son loves his new big boy seat.
easy to install and use
this is a great organizer! i bought another one as a gift.
great stuff for bottle feeding!
excellent product
just as described! perfect system for storing with ease.
great for toddlers
"sturdy and strong! can be used for a baby just learning to sit or can't sit as the back of the chair reclines. also the tray table moves forward and back as baby gets bigger. the chair cover can easily come of for washing as well, i love it"
cute little book that is fish shaped. there are only a few cloth pages but just enough to keep the 13 month old entertained. it's a good size that she likes to open it and study each page. we've seen her tell a story in her way then she laughs and claps as she turns the pages.
"wonderful item, it serves a great purpose: to keep my baby from running off into parking lots, etc. and it doubles as a small diaper bag, that she can carry herself."
beautiful and functional.  not as strong as some other gates but gets the job done.  i like it bc i can open with one hand and slam shut as i walk through.
"brother & sister n law said it gets lots of use, very pretty."
this is a great bouncy seat. it is a little difficult to change the batteries but otherwise we loved it!
"my son loves this thing! he usually hates tummy time, but he enjoys looking at himself so now he likes tummy time. :)"
loved these as a new mom! i had trouble with engorgement and over production of milk. these fit right in my bra and worked with assisting in letdown (using warm) and then using the cold to help with pain after feeds.  i also loved using them warm when i have had a couple blocked ducts.
"i bought as a gift for a friend and it was a hit. the baby is not born yet so i can't tell you that he liked it, but i am sure that we will have a lot of fun pictures."
great for little hands! well worth the couple of bucks.
cute

perfect for traving and so easy to use!!
my 1 1/2 year old grandson rolled the balls over and over and over again.  great simple fun.
beautiful.  nice construction.  easy to attach pictures.  i would buy it again.
love it!
loved this
my baby loved this. it kept her attention. it's well made and sturdy
great for travelling
works perfect
"no mess, perfect!!"
"i adore my baby k'tan. it was a learning experience putting it on and using it the first few times. after i got use to it it became a lifesaver. it's super fast and easy to use, my baby (now a young toddler) loves being in it. the different positions really allow it to grow with baby. i really got good at being able to nurse in it (completely discreetly!) while shopping. this is actually the second one i've ordered (for a friend!) my husband says he wants one in his size if we have more kids!"
my great grand son loved it.  he ate all his baby food and fell asleep in the chair.  it is his first high chair.
"perfect addition to our uppababy vista, we get complements on it all the time. holds most water bottles and has that hidden covered compartment in the middle where we carry personal stuff like cellphone and wallet without everyone to see. it also magnetically snaps shut without making noise, an issue with sleeping kids in the stroller. the velcro seems really strong and keeps it in its place on the stroller. we also haven't had to take it off to fold the stroller which is also nice. it was a good buy."
"bought this decoration for my granddaughter's first christmas. this is precious ornament, much cuter than expected."
super cute & made in usa!
my grand baby loves it!!!
love this! so easy to use
easy install! great seat for the cost!
this is he best. it really helps prevent flathead on newborn babies. i bought this when our infant was four months old. i wish i had known about the noggin earlier. every home with a newborn should own one.
these are totally adorable!  and great for keeping baby's ankles warm as well as for easy diaper changing.  and i like that they are boy designs :)
"its great, waterproof and very warm. looks smart and just as nice as more expensive versions. perfect for the east coast winter. plus faster than anticipated delivery."
This is great!  You can fit two soothies in it.
Experience is good
Adorable! The baby looks so cute!
Its a super cute Binky but my son doesn't like pacifiers lol oh well.
My nine-month-old loves these. I love them too easy to keep clean. I really like the doctor Brown's line of products.
very good video quality in lighted and dark conditions.
"love these things!  they are made out of the same material as the wonderful bumkins bibs, washable, reusable, and cute! i have hand washed them and machine washed them, they have held up very well and hold a lot of food!  much nicer than a ziploc - and easier for little hands to use a zipper like this!"
good
love these. make a nice room upgrade.
we use daily for feeding our 1 and 4 year old kids breakfast.  durable through a year of daily dishwasher cleaning.  green plastic part pops off but is easy to put back on.
These will be great for a Christmas gift exchange! Items were delivered very quickly
Soooo cute. Nothing more to be said. All of my kids have used and loved wubbanubs.
We love wubbanubs! My son has never used anything put these since the day he was born. They are very durable and washable.
good
"great child lock for your door wall!  keeps little kids from opening the door, but is easy for adults to open."
i love how absorbent and trim these are. i can use alone or add just one of these as a doubler during the night and my 7 month old will last all night 10+ hours!
no fluff here. it is what it is and it serves its purpose in protecting the crib rails. fits our wider front crib rail. easy to apply. toy tethers are a great addition.
works very well
"my grandbaby loves her chair.  she is truly a tv lover, opting for such deep and moving films as cloudy with a chance of meatballs.  any kid - 3 years old will love this chair."
"my 10 month old loves these, i stack them and she knocks them down and gets very excited. they are a hard rubbery material so she enjoys &#34;chewing&#34; on them as well. very happy with this purchase!"
great for baby proofing the house....
"very good product , it was what i expected , i recommend hundred percent, i would definitely buy this product again."
"never had one bad experience using these bags! never leaked for me, very nice size and affordable!"
thanks
true to size and proportioned well. body is of white stiff material tho
"easy and looks cute. the clay does dry &#34;soft&#34; which is fine, just didn't expect a puff paint consistency."
"great price, great product.  we have a giant puppy that's not ready to roam the house so keeping her in the kitchen with this gate has been a huge help.  it's strong enough to keep a large puppy inside as she jumps on it and bangs at it.  we have a wide opening between our kitchen and dining room and this gate was easy to manage to create the perfect size we needed."
"this product was made very well, but my grandson didn't like being in there so we use it as a gate."
"our 5-month old loves to hold this and, of course, put it in his mouth. he even snuggles with it!<br />plus, it's safe to put in the washer and dryer, which makes cleaning it a breeze!"
great car seat. love that it can grow with the child.
excellent purchase
"very cute and decent sized (about the size of a football). i bought this for my 2.5 year old for christmas because it is a simple, traditional design without any messy glitter or glued on pieces to be an issue."
"washable, and cute - much nicer to use than a ziploc.  the zipper is easy for my little one to use, too.  washed by hand and in the washing machine - they hold up great.  these are made out of the same material as the wonderful bumkins bibs.  hold a perfect amount of goldfish for a day out on the town!"
"very comfortable, attractive and useful."
this soo cute. i have a dog who flips out if someone knocks or rings the door bell this helps!
beautiful headbands
"its took a time for my daughter to get use to it, but it was worth it!!!!!!! no leaking, nice color!"
great
perfect fit for little babies. only thing that did not swamp our little guy.
good.
"it really works! my daughter suffer from constipation. i used the windy, and helped her instantly. totally recomended"
"very good quality,  it fits small  good  for pre kinder only"
"thirsties duo wraps give the trimmest fit i've found so far, and i've tried blueberry coveralls, rumparooz, planetwise and thirsties. they don't cut into my baby's legs while making the waist fit properly like the other covers.and the velcro makes for a quick change especially if baby is being fussy during a diaper change."
my son started chewing on his crib like a typical and i purchased these because i needed to cover his crib rails. and they have been washed and chewed on and washed again. and they are still in great condition. and they were at a great price.
nice quality! fits a standard oval shape bassinet mattress.
best bottle brush hands down!
very nice and very good quality. easy to follow assembly instructions.
comfy for those little ones who love their bath!  to kick free and splash with joy!
Granddaughters like them. Seem to be working out very well.
"Soft, cute, and easy for baby to hold"
My little guy loved these pacifiers when he was a newborn! Still has some he uses every now and then and he is 8 mo tha old now!
"Grand daughter loves them! And they are cheaper than any store, do recommend these!!"
yes i love it-will give it at shower with lots of animal print baby clothes!!!
"we use cloth 90% of the time. it really isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. her skin looks amazing! no rashes. ever. these covers are amazing. they have a flap on each end that holds the cloth diaper in, no need for pinning at all. i have tried about 10 different types/brands and this is the easiest one for us. as long as the cover doesn't get gross you only have to change the insert. we have one set of the flip over night inserts. they are lovely but expensive. we use a cheaper prefold and they work perfectly. we plan on giving a cover to each pregnant mommy we know."
"love the zipper protection. works great for keeping bodily and animal fluids from ruining the mattress. my dog is normally great, but had a bladder infection and wet the bed. this saved the mattress and it all washed out! the terry cloth is also a huge improvement over the cotton tops because it doesn't get caught and pull/fall apart."
"we love halo sleep sacks.  our 6 mo old sleeps longer and better in this than a blanket, swaddle, or just jammies."
great christmas gift for a prissy little one.
still in perfect condition after 2 years of abuse.
"awesome!  i loved it.  it really helped my baby sleep better and longer.  i started using it when she was about a month and a half old. she kept breaking out of the other swaddle sleep sack i had.  she would cry and struggle for a bit when she was first put in it, but that got better as she got use to it.  it also made middle of the night nursing really easy. i stopped using it right at 3 month.  she started getting really annoyed with it in the early morning.  thrashing around and struggling to get out.  it was always really cute when i would first release her from the swaddle.  she would be super happy and stretch out a whole lot.  i definitely recommend this product.  it worked great for us, even it was just for a month and a half."
"i wasn't sure hands free pumping would be a possibility but this holds the pump cups on nice and tight for perfect suction. it's soft and comfy, and is made with quality material so it will last."
great
"a very light and roomy bag with multiple loops and pockets. weight is important considering how much stuff you have to pack with you when you go out.    unlike most diaper bags it fits in the bottom part of our stroller, so we don't have to lug it around with us.    to give you an idea of just how roomy it is, we can fit 10 diapers, wipes, a changing pad, 2-3 wash cloths, a change of clothes, a toy or two and a pretty thick blanket."
"daughter loves to throw, and loves these. much easier than dr. brown's if looking for a glass bottle."
we have tried several diaper pail liners and this is by far my favorite brand.  we use this liner in the ubbi pail.  we always hang it to dry.
these are really nice sippy cups. my only comment would be they are on the large side.
love it's
"really easy to get in and out of the car, if you need something that moves.  straps are great and easy to get my son in and out of, too.  i recommend loosening and tightening every time you get the child in and out, one pull on the front strap tightens it right back up."
super soft.  one of my sons favorite stuffed animals.  he sleeps with it every night.
"i'm a fan! just brought my newborn home last week and he loves to stare at the pretty colors on the ceiling. i also like that i can use the glow from the projector as a mild lamp and see baby's face and such in the night when i check on him without having to turn on any lights. i haven't used the sounds or other features yet. i'll update this if anything goes out on the machine. otherwise, i'm a very happy customer."
good
this product is a very safe concept. i did try other colors and did not like them as they were too glossy for my taste. i did love the white because it looks better to me. it does have some of the glossy satin on the edges but is not as noticeable in the white color
"my granddaughters parents loved it. i haven't seen it as of yet, my granddaughter nylah mae  is about 6 weeks old."
These are so great! I have a few and my babe just loved them. They are the same binky used in the hospital.
pretty.
nice
Thus is my third little one who loves these pacifiers!  The flex design is awesome! Mimics nursing nicely.
We love wubbanubs! And you cant beat how cute they are
Love these!
awesome
love these combined with my flips.
this seat has worked great for my boy/girl twins! the potty shield keeps the boy from making a mess but does not stick up so high that they have a hard time getting over it. i love that it has an air freshener. i got refills at target.
these are great for hard wood floors!
colorful and stick well (as opposed to other brands that did not!).
"i love this mobile. the craftsmanship is fantastic! each elephant is colorful without being overboard and the material is very soft. it is a wind-up mobile so it doesn't play continuously but that's not a drawback in my eyes. my son seems engaged by the movement, colors, and the music when it's on. my toddler daughter seems to really like it too. i've caught her reaching for the mobile on more than one occasion so it's a hit with all age ranges it seems."
natural solution
these were the first pocket diapers we bought. i have nothing to compare them to besides my fst and covers. i really like them! they are great for my relatives to use abs gray for overnight.
awesome
"excellent adaptability for multiple sized spaces.  i've been using it to close off my kitchen from the living room during cooking times so little hands can't reach the stove, but i'll be repositioning it during the holidays to surround the christmas tree so little hands don't pull the tree over or break ornaments!"
great product.
"i put the car seat cover pad in last night, it literally took 5 minutes! it was very easy to install and to put the car seat in over it. it will definitely protect my car from my toddler crawling in and out of the car!"
arrive unharmed and well before expected date.  works like a charm and makes our shopping trips much easier.
i bought on for each of my daughters.  they love thm.
nice bibs and a good size for pre-toddler.
excellent
"works great with my medela, glad i bought two."
"such a cute bank.  a little small and awkward shape to store much money, would be better for change not bills."
we had the newborn size and loved it so much we got the next size up when our baby outgrew the newborn size. for a baby born in the colder months this is a necessity. this provides the warmth needed for cold nights and the swaddle to control arms that can wake a baby. our baby started sleeping 12 plus hours before 2 months old. worth every penny!
"so many compliments on this monster suit! it is also very warm, no coats required!"
"we absolutely love this high chair, and so does our son!  it's perfect for mealtime, and easy to get him in and out of it.  even after he is done eating, he enjoys sitting in his chair and playing with his toys on the tray!  i would recommend this to everyone!"
love it!  works to hold up all stuff animals
"good quality, thin light weight blanket."
"i got this for my daughter-in who just had my grandgirl. she's only had it for a few weeks and loves it. what makes it extra nice is it comes with a brush. the basket holds bottle nipples, smaller bottles, baby spoons, medicine cups. anything small that you wouldn't want to disappear. fill it up, put it in dishwasher, after it's clean, take out. everything she puts in the basket is protected."
:)
"i love it,  my son does too<br />makes it easy for him to put back in his mouth (3m). easy to find anywhere,  great as gifts,  will deff buy more"
this fits my 12 month old great. he stays nice and warm when he sleeps and there is no worry of getting caught or twisted in blankets.
perfect
got it on time. just what i wanted. could ask for more.
real nice gate and just the right size!
very cute and have held up well. we have had these decals up for almost a year and there has been no peeling yet. we have other wall decals (different brand) and they are peeling already. very happy with this purchase.
this is really great.  i had a few of the character ones and my child always complained his butt hurt.  once i bought this one i have had no more trouble.  so glad i went ahead and bought it.  i also do not have any trouble with it fitting sturdily on my toilet.
a very safer children seat for my 3-year old baby
just purchased this bed a couple month ago for our 18 month old to transition into from crib. it is quite easy to assemble and takes about 20 minutes. mattress from her crib fit it perfectly.  she just started using it and she loves it. it is very easy for her to climb into at 18 months old. i highly recommend for the value.
"so comfortable, very high quality, and adorable.  this was the only place my son would sleep for months. he preferred to sleep on his monkey mat, rather than in his crib. and it's portable!"
quality product - seemed better than the bottles that came with my pump 2 years ago.  quick shipping.  great sale.
super bien
"i love the seat because it has a latch system on it. also, the seat is not real bulky."
"purchased this as a gift for my friends one year old son. item arrived much quicker than i expected, exactly as listed, and is a huge hit with the baby. definitely recommend this product for 12months and up."
perfect sound quality
i love not putting bleach on my baby's penis!
very nice ty in person and it fits my son very well
good item<br /> fast delivery
"i bought this bed for my daughter when she was 18mo, she is now 3 and still using it. she loves to jump on the bed (despite me telling her not to) and this has stood up to it like a champ. i put it together by myself while i was pregnant with twins, no problems at all. now that the twins are getting big i ordered another one and the oldest will hand hers down so she can get a big girl bed and the twins will have matching toddler beds. honestly, the 3 year old could probably use this toddler bed for at least another year or two if she were not handing it down to one if the twins."
"my little granddaughter just loves this walker.  i chose this one because she is little for her age and i read a review that said it was a bit short for most babies.  it fits her perfectly! it's sturdy, was easy to put together, easy to clean and folds up easily for transport. the only thing i noticed was the wheels don't work easily when going backwards."
"i had originally purchased and used another tub for my infant son - once he got to about 3 months old the other tub was awkward and uncomfortable and he hated bath time.<br /><br />this tub is great. the slight recline on the reclining infant side is perfect, and he doesn't slide around. i like that the plastic seat has no hard, angular edges so it's much more comfortable."
"my infant son loves this little thing.  the exterior fabric is the same material used on many running shoes, so it's not plush at all. the ears make that crakling sound that babies seem to love. i thought that was interesting."
"we've only had these a short while, but we've had no problems so far. they seem very well made and have worked well for us. my three year old has issues with noise so i got them for him to wear in the car when his baby sister cries. we can still talk to each other, but they do a great job muffling her cries."
perfect bedding and perfect price!!!
so easy to link to your main unit; great quality. no issues whatsoever between switching back and forth with our two cameras!
this was an awesome product. my daughter in law loves having it keep the baby warm. my son loves it because when he carries the seat his hand has room to move without having fabric move around. my granddaughter loves looking at the black and white design when we reverse this cover. very nicely made. shipment was quick. we all love this prodcut!
i feel safer having it on the faucet since once my granddaughter slipped in the tub and hit the faucet and busted her lip! awesome transaction
great product and was needed for all my baby bottles for daycare.
quality design at it's best.  there is no question why it is super popular at every baby shower.
"This thing is ridiculously cute and so soft.  The size is great for it's intended recipient- a niece that's turning three soon.  It seems pretty well made, too.  I'm honestly tempted to buy one for myself."
Daughter loves then no other pacifier compares.
Cute. My son loves it. I didn't get it for him until he was 9 months old but he still enjoys it. It keeps the pacifier from bouncing all over the place. We have many Soothie pacifiers and can never find them when they have fallen because they bounce under things.
Excellent product and the shipping was very fast.<br /> Very satisfied.
Love the material!
"really fun game to play, got a laugh out of the group trying to stick the dummy on babies face, pretty cheaply made but good for a fun game at the baby shower."
Can't wait for my grand daughter to get her little hands on this one. She has most of them but laid them out for all of us to see.  She's a nut!
Even cuter in person!  Love WubbaNub!
This made a great gag gift to a Raiders fan. The quality and price met expectations.
My daughter's first and favorite pacifier.
"Love these, baby's face stays much drier and she can pick up easily (7 mo)"
"I had the NUK soft orthodontic binkies for my daughter when she was a newborn. They don't make them for older children (over 6 months) though. So I searched for all-silicone pacifiers and found these.  The big ring is a bit awkward at first, but it makes it easy to put on loveys etc.  They also don't leave marks on my child's face.    I clean them every day just with soap and water and put them in one of my MAM bottles while sterilizing them. Easy as pie. Will get more."
My child LOVES these and takes them everywhere:)
My son loves his wubba! I read some reviews about washing paci holder. It's not difficult. I just threw it in washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry!! Then I washed paci in sink with dish soap & problem solved!!!!!! Good as new!!!!!!!!
Awesome fit for my son.  I loved it!
"I never knew what a wubbanub was until my friend asked me why my 3 month old didn't have one. I went online that night and ordered two! The package arrived promptly, and my daughter loves them. They are nice because as your baby develops her fine motor skills she is able to learn how to put the soothie in her mouth herself. Great buy!!"
Never lose a binky again!  These are great and machine washable and air dry quickly.
Bub isn't much into pacifiers it seems.  But he definitely takes this better than the round Natursutten that hits his nose.  I like this one is natural rubber and is made in one piece (not joined) like some other rubber pacifiers.  The hook fits nicely on your finger without slipping when you haven't got anywhere to pop it down straight away.
this was one of the best items i bought when i had a newborn
My son loves it. We named it monkey and monkey goes everywhere my son goes. It's also very easy to find
"You can do no wrong with the Billy Bob gag Pacifiers.  I bought one with 2 huge bucked teeth in the front and they were hilarious.  The grillz are for a girl and her father loved it.  The baby will not really use it as a pacifier normal wear and tear but when they approach their lunch or whatever friends, it is going to be a hoot."
I love it.
fit my graco pack n play perfect lil pricey but be sure you measure your playpen
this protectors seem to be working well and keeping our baby safe from sharp corners in our house. so far we have covered all around the corners and sides of our end stands and along sharp parts on the wall. very happy with the thickness and quality of the product as well as how much you get for the price. the 3m tape works well to get the cushions to stick to the furniture and they provide more than enough for how much cushioning you are given.
this is the best high chair for little spaces and works great at restaurants and to carry around.
these pouches are great! so easy to fill and clean. my daughter thinks it is so fun to fill them with our own homemade purees.
it was everything that i wanted for my granddaughter. i'd looked in local stores and couldn't find this lamp to complete her frozen bedroom. so one little girl will be thrilled come christmas.
great quality!
"this has been one of the best baby product purchases we have made so far.  we have hard wood floors and needed a soft surface for our baby to crawl, roll and walk on.  this is perfect! it is very big and covers a large play area.  the mat is brightly colored and the playful pictures keep our baby engaged.  he had multiple falls on this mat as he learned to walk and he would get up unaffected. the mat is not super thick, but it is very dense and will protect them from bumps and bruises."
"this one is perfect for storage baby food you make. easy to store and easy to remove, and it's deep and can store lots of food."
very cool product that adds a lot of safety for kids when bathing. fit like a charm on our bath spout.
always a favorite go to for a new baby gift.
"i went back and forth on this purchase because of the price, but i couldn't be happier with it! beautiful art and perfect for the nursery."
happy!
nice for the price.
great to have found some since that is what the grand baby loves.
perfect for recovery from lumbar surger.
my 18 month old grandson loves it!
i love this! very easy to use. would definite recommend.
"i must admit i was expecting a low quality product that was durable enough to last a few months, but imagine my surprise that the product was not only beyond my quality expectations but absolutely beautiful. this product is made 10x better than most american products."
My son loves this pacifier and I love being able to find it in his car seat when it comes out of his mouth. My only SMALL problem is that he likes to pull it out.
"I honestly don't know how I made it through my first two kids without one of these!! They are great for so many reasons: 1. They are easy to find, and don't get lost - I have exclusively used one binky for the last 5 months compared to the dozens I had gone through with my other two kids by the same time, saving $$ as well! (They are also much easier to find than just a single little binky in the dark or in the car!) 2. My baby has learned how to put his own binky in his mouth MONTHS earlier than my others did. Since it is so much bigger - much less dexterity and coordination is necessary to get it in his own mouth! 3. It STAYS in place. This is the kicker for me. Especially as a newborn, before they really have the suction power to keep their binky in - when they spit out their bink half-way, it doesn't fall out completely = less trips for mom and dad to put it back in their mouth! 4. Although this is just anticipation, when it's time to wean off of the binky, I think it will be much easier to just cut off the actual binky and let them play with the animal for comfort. Hopefully it will be an easier transition by letting them keep some of what they have become attached to.<br /><br />After 5 months of constant use, our binky is starting to tear where it is stitched to the animal. Honestly, this does not concern me at all given the fact that we use it all the time. If I only need one binky every 5-6 months, I'm one happy mama!"
We bought this for our son's family it is a vemry good conversation piece and it makes you laugh and that makes the baby laugh! This would work great for thank you cards with the baby picture! Imagine that! Lol
Loved it!
these work perfect
"love it, had the whole family cracking up!!"
Adorable!
So cute!
Perfect for my baby who's 6 mo old.
good purchase
my daughter loves these - great quality for a great price
"We have about 5 different types of pacifiers, and this ended up the only one being used because we can actually find it (unlike the other dozen that end up underneath blankets and in between cushions).  At two months, the baby has started to hold onto the arms and legs of the monkey and play with it, happy to be able to grab something.  We'll probably get another one as a back up.<br /><br />I'd put the WubbaNub a requirement to purchase prepping for a baby's arrival."
We love AVENT pacifiers!  Great price and fast shipping!
"I'm in my mid-30's.  Everyone around me is having babies.  I've given one of these to at least 10 new mothers and they ALL love them.  I'm actually tagged in several photos of babies sucking on these adorable WubbaNubs.  I can often find one that pairs with any nursery theme, great for little hands to hold onto, easy to find, and the paci is the same as the one they give at all the local hospitals - something about that rubber and size makes it irresistible for newbies.  Buy a bunch to have on hand, throw on top of a gift, it's a special little bonus gift not many mamas tend to know about - they'll love it."
My son will only take this pacifier! Lol I lost the first one and had to buy the exact one ASAP! I also love the fact that he can find it easily at night. He grabs it and places it right in his mouth. He's not able to do that with a regular pacifier. This pacifier is a bit pricy but worth it at the end.
My daughter will only use this brand and style of binky. The glow in the dark is very useful when she drops it at night!! I believe these are the best pacifiers out there!
big enough to put all my daughter's plush toys!<br />so cute!!
"this is so soft, i love this blanket. it's a must have."
this product is the best! (or should i say &#34;brest&#34;).  i recommend bringing it to the hospital with you to help in those first feedings.  i have used it every day since my baby came home. he is now three months old.
good
"we bought this for ease of travel rather than bringing our full size car seat for our 4-year old.  it is lightweight and easy to carry and store.  very simple to install when taking a cab or uber.  for airline travel it would fit under most airline seats and it fit easily in the overhead on a jetblue e190 (where roll-aboards need to go in sideways), this fit perfectly in the space after two roll-aboards were loaded above."
the best breast pads ever!
love it for kids bathtub toys.  out of the way and keeps everthing tidy.  delivery was quick and the quality is good for being a plastic product.
great product!
very cute
"These work great for my baby. The two larger bottles come with size two nipples instead of size one, so order extra size one nipples if you want to use them."
The owl nub is a litte bigger/sturdier than the other ones and it holds better.  Plus it's super cute.  My daughter loves this.
love the color
Love these! Glow is just enough to help him or us find it in the wee hours of the night.
My son's favorite Wubby!!
"Would never buy any other name in nipples or pacifiers. They are strong, orthodontically correct and clean up easily."
"Very convenient for newborns who aren't able to hold the pacifier in themselves. My daughter has Down Syndrome, which tends to be associated with low muscle tone, making it a little more challenging to maintain her hold on the pacifiers. This was really helpful in keeping the pacifier in for her, which also led to her muscle tone improving thanks to basically working out her muscles by sucking on the pacifier. It was very handy in the NICU, by holding the pacifier in for her when someone wasn't able to physically pop it back in her mouth. It's also been convenient in her car seat, when I am not able to help hold her pacifier for her."
Great!
Really very good!
easy for my baby!
so cute and funny
Very handy!
"My 4 month old loves this pacifier! We started out with just a frog wubbanub, but needed another for when we needed to clean the frog. My daughter loves to take the bunny out of her mouth to look at it and then put it back in her mouth! She loves to chew on the bunnies ears. :)"
Baby likes them. They are not vanilla scented like the ones she loved in the hospital but she still likes them the same.
My baby love it!
"We purchased this pacifier and the Brown Monkey pacifier for my son, along with other plain Phillips Avent Soothie pacifiers.  The WubbaNubs were by far my son's favorites, especially the Puppy (he even had a name for it), but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him.  Infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments.  We live overseas so you don't see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them.  Before buying this item, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs. the plain Avent Soothies but I think it is well worth the extra money.  Even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers, we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them, and some of the plain pacifiers, with the Brown Monkey, another Brown Puppy, and the Turtle.  We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things."
"This is our son's favorite pacifier.  We've tried them all.  He has a synthetic allergy, so we do all natural products.  This is a hit.  We've tried all of the pacifiers out there.  These win."
I purchased two for my diaper bag and dads. Cute way to keep up with baby's paci's.
Love it!
Kitty pacifier is the best. My 10 month old gives it 5 stars.
"If your child loves their pacifier, then this is a must have item.  I have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier.  Most of the items I have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference.<br /><br />One thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier.  She is a big pacifier baby.  I learned quickly that even though young babies can't control their movements and can't throw things, a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again.<br /><br />Wubbanubs actually solve this problem.  When a pacifier falls, it can't go far.  If it is thrown, it is easily found.  And when babies start being able to control their hands, they can grasp the stuffed animal and bring it to their mouth much earlier than they would be able to with just a normal pacifier."
"It's 3am. It's been an hour since the baby ate last and you have finally slipped into REM sleep. Beautiful sleep... you start to dream and BAM! The baby lets out a cry and you look at the clock. Letting out a groan you roll out of bed and stumble to the baby. The baby is still asleep but that won't last long if you can't locate the pacifier. Thank goodness you thought to buy a MAM Night Glow pacifier. Instead blindly feeling around the bed... then crawling around the floor hoping you can find it in time... You spot the pacifier immediately, pop it into baby's mouth and he/she makes that classic Maggie Simpson sucking noise. Silently you tip-toe back to bed and hope it lasts...<br /><br />Bottom line: Even if it's been hours since the pacifier has been exposed to light, it still emits a decent glow so you can locate it in the darkest of rooms. I only buy the glow in the dark pacifiers now. Unlike many other pacifiers MAM pacifiers can be put in two ways.... there is no &#34;right side&#34; up. This makes giving it to baby in the middle of the night that much easier. I love MAM and will continue to buy these for my babies!"
Love it! Fast delivery.
Perfect for Seahawk fan baby!  The colors are perfect!!!!
good...........
good...........
"We purchased this pacifier and the Brown Puppy pacifier for my son, along with other plain Phillips Avent Soothie pacifiers.  The WubbaNubs were by far my son's favorites, especially the Puppy (he even had a name for it), but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him.  Infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments.  We live overseas so you don't see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them.

We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things.  One other note....when we weened our son off of his pacifiers, we got him a blanket with a monkey head attached to it (it's cuter than it sounds) to replace his Monkey pacifier.  Did going from the Monkey pacifier to the Monkey blanket make that transition easier?  I don't know...it seemed to us like it did but it's just a single data point."
Great baby shower gift!
very goog
The only binkey my baby will take. Worth the $!
Perfect - exactly as advertised.
great bibs and they wash well
love the music and the colors great learning for babies
i use this snug for my orbit baby g3 carseat..fit perfectly and baby sleep good!!
"i had a lot of back pain carrying my son, and had to limit our time together because of that. my first carrier (chico) would not hold him well and i didn't feel comfortable with it. the babybjorn miracle is wonderful. he feels very comfortable on it even for long periods of time. my back is protected and the weight is distributed. i can hold him for over an hour."
Read previous reviews and was not sure about the product. Ordered and the stickers work great. Placed on clean flat painted wall with limited handling of stickers and used wall paper squeegee after placement. It is bright and cheerful perfect for the nursery.
perfect for the baby on board!!!
It's so cute.
Great quality
Good
Love these!
It so far is great!
good
Great seller. A+
"Best thing ever, keeps pacifier in place, even when baby wearing. Hate that i did not discover this until child #3."
"not too much to say, but these are the only pacifiers our 7 month old will take.  Good price"
These are great for older babies and good for teething. My son loves them!
i've had one of these with all 3 of my kids and i love them! they're perfect for keeping track of all the milestones and changes.
great for my baby! nice and soft.
swaddling with just a blanket or sheet was becoming so tedious and our little girl was able to kick her way out of it. this product is awesome. it simplifies the whole process and keeps our bundle of joy comfy and cozy.
the best bath chair ever!
supportive and it prevents my daughter neck from moving back and forth while she sleeping. i love the fact it completely smooth one side and soft and furry on the other. my daughter prefers the smooth side; overall we are very pleased with this purchase.
"i am very pleased with this product. it definitely makes me feel more comfortable with our little one following us around in the kitchen. it prevents him from grabbing the pan/pot handles, and possibly dumping their hot contents onto himself. it keeps his hand out of the fire. it also keeps what we are cooking out of his line of sight so he isn't as interested. i also like that it does warm up enough to warn him that he shouldn't be messing around with it, but not enough to hurt him.<br /><br />the installation is very easy. i did have to pull our stove/oven away from the wall to fit the velcro attachments, but it was a breeze otherwise<br /><br />my only complaint with this purchase was the lack of prime shipping options. i'm definitely spoiled by amazon now. i almost didn't buy it specifically because of the ~$10 to shipping (which increases the cost of this item by 1/3). i'm sure they are losing a significant amount of sales due to this. it also took 9 days to arrive which seems absurd now that amazon has conditioned me to think 2 day shipping should be free.<br /><br />aside from the shipping cost/experience, the product itself is wonderful."
"our daughter loves her swing. the canopy is a bit bothersome so we don't use it but otherwise the swing is comfortable and well made, plus it is made in the usa. grandma( my mother )with hand issues does have some trouble managing the release mechanism."
i've been using it for about 2 months. its almost completely silent and produces a good thick stream of moisture.  i like to have it mist into my face while working on computer to help with dry eyes.
arrived on time. brandnew and packaged well. complete. wish there was a choice of what colour i wanted but i'm fine with the product.
great teether
"very nice, very big, and with a plug so you don't have to break it. can't wait to give it to my great grandson for christmas!"
bought this for my baby girl and i love it!  sure to be a favorite.
great price! will buy again and again for nieces that are born in this family. she loved it.
really helpfull
item was as described & fast shipping.
really cozy. love it
very cute and stylish. my daughters favorite brand.
loved it
Works wonders on a cranky baby.  Highly recommended for any new Mom or Grandma!  A must for the nursery!
I have a new grandniece.  I bought these pacifiers along with some others of a different brand.  Every time I saw her she had this same pacifier so I asked the parents why were they changing up the pacifiers and they said that this is the baby's favorite pacifier.  Who knew??!!
Very cute! My baby love this pacifier!
So cute
They r great
Good
"My son's favorite paci!! Glow in the dark is the best, easy for both of us to find! lol."
The best pacifiers for newborns. I had 2 in each room of the house when my son was a baby. They work like a charm.
Thanks
she loves it :)
"My 3rd child is a pacifier baby. Didn't need one with my first two. I have tried dozens of them, from Dr. Browns to Nuk, to First years and so on. This is THE BEST PACIFIER Hands down!! My son loves it and it stays in his mouth! No funny marks from the pacifiers that have the harder outer ring that suctions to your babies face!<br /><br />These Avent pacifiers are BPA Free, which is the only way to go! I'm very particular about what my baby puts in his mouth (product wise) He's got a very hard sucking action to him and I am now using the 3 month and older pacifier but let me tell you, you will NEVER go back to another pacifier after purchasing these! Way to go Avent! Great product! BPA Free! Great design that leaves NO facial marks either! The best!"
Wubb goes everywhere with my daughter! The lamb doll is adorable and has enabled her to pick up her own pacifier and self soothe from the time she was a very small bundle.
This is the same brand pacifier that was given to my daughter at the hospital so when we lost it we just got some more and my daughter loves them
Great for holding my extra pacifier
Adorable!!!
Really cute & my grandson loves it. I love it because it doesn't get lost as easily as other pacifiers & he can hold onto it & find it easily.
Love these pacifiers!
Took my 4 week old a couple of days to get use to the wubbanub because it fit alittle different in his mouth. But now we love it!! So much easier to find than and looses it so much less than without this on there.
Great item.
"they are very nice pacifiers, my babies love them and they wash up nicely."
"Dude, these things really glow bright! They are also a good size, cute, and I love that they glow in the dark."
Love these! I got the wrong size but it will do for now.
Loved it!
Loved it!
These are great. Good size. Cute design.
Love these!
Love this pacifier. It doesn't get lost as easily as other pacifiers. My grandson can find it & hold onto it a lot more easily than regular pacifiers.
This is amazing. My daughter had problems holding a pacifier in her mouth and couldn't yet pick it up to put it back in. Well she could hug the lamb and it would stay in. I would highly reconnect this to anyone with a little one.
"Perfect. A little big for newborns, but at least he can keep it in his mouth better than the rounded ones."
My granddaughter loves this pacifier and it is so cute.
My grandson loves this & so do I. It's easy to find & grab when he's upset. It doesn't get lost as easily as a plain pacifier.
The best pacifiers ever! They are rounded away from the face so you don't get a ring around the mouth mark like most traditional pacifiers.  This is the only one my son likes now!
My baby loves this and hold onto it. It's definitely a soother and the variety of animals is great.
Smell really nice I love the vanilla scent.
"Super easy to wash as you can just throw it in the washing machine!  My 11 month old son cannot sleep with out this!  And bonus, now that he's older if he wakes up at night, he feels around his crib for this monkey and can put it in himself."
my kids just love it!<br />easy to hold and find at night and day!
"This is our 4th WubbaNub.  These are awesome pacifiers for babies who prefer the Soothie-brand pacifier.  They don't fall out of the crib and are quite cute dangling from baby's mouth.  For new parents contemplating this item, buy 2 at a time:  one for current use when the other is in the wash because it got spaghetti sauce on it or fell on a dirty floor!  It is important to note, too, as other reviews have mentioned, the pacifier does not detach from the stuffed animal.  The pacifier is sewn to the animal and can easily be thrown in the laundry and then air-dried."
"Pretty quick shipping and very adorable.... Glad I purchased, thanks."
"Great product, nice package, good price."
I love Wubbanub pacifiers now! My daughter learned how to hold them by two months of age and loves snuggling with them. I especially love that it holds the pacifier up as well.
"My daughter would not take the regular &#34;soothies&#34; pacifiers (our older daughter loved those). We tried these because they were a tad smaller, both in length and circumference,  and she preferred these. Good deal to buy 5 right off the bat instead of those single or 2 packs."
"We keep this strapped to the baby's carseat so we are never far from a clean pacifier in public. Great concept! It never opens on it's own, has a good 'lock' to it."
Very nice product.  Makes a nice baby/shower gift.
"Bought this as a gift for my niece. She is older (in first grade), but has seizure disorder triggered by stress and sucking on a pacifier helps calm her down and prevent seizing. This plushie helps her &#34;normalize&#34; having the binkie and is helping her learn to use the plushie to calm down instead of the binkie. She loves the pattern and color too."
"These pacifiers are one of the better all around designs we've found. The cutout for the nose means our daughter does not spit it out as much and the nipple is soft enough but substantial enough to keep her interested. An added loop makes it easy to attach a strap or, more importantly, loop around your finger during the inevitable hold where baby is refusing. The clear plastic also makes it easy to see if something is on it or if it's worth cleaning."
I think is the best pacifier in the market
"I can't say enough good about this pacifier! I had planned on not using a pacifier with my daughter due to my firstborn's heavy attachment to his. However, she started wanting to nurse 24/7 a couple weeks after she was born, so I finally broke down and bought her a paci. It became clear very quickly that she wanted nothing to do with one. I tried multiple pacifiers and none of them were even remotely accepted by her. I was pretty beside myself about it and did a search to see what the most breast-like pacifier was and was led to this one. I placed my order right away, and as soon as it was delivered I opened it up, boiled it, and presented it to my daughter. She didn't care for it until she got a little upset later on, but then she took it right away! She definitely knows the difference between the pacifier and the breast, but she has accepted the pacifier as an &#34;okay&#34; substitute until boob becomes more convenient. Soooo, I strongly recommend that any breastfeeding mothers try this pacifier if you need a bit of a break!"
My son loved this pacifier as an infant but it took a long time to break him away from it. Overall it was great comfort for him.
My loves loves this product! Fast shipping
LOVE this wubbanub.
Delivered In A Decent Amount If Time. Cute Little Packaging And An Adorable Print!
The best pacifier ever! They are great for the itty bitty ones. I can prop them on the babies belly and they can find them much eaisier that way. Then when baby gets older they can find them better in the crib.
Totally love
good value
baby loves it.  I recommend getting two or more so you will have a backup in case his favorite gets lost.
it's a favorite and seconds as a plush to hold on to!
I laugh every time I see them.
"Good, but leaves a mark on the face"
I Would Always Drop The Pacifier And Have To Dispose Of Them But Now It Stays Protected! Such A Clever Idea For Mothers And Never Gets Lost!
"great, very helpful, and the delivery time even to Brazil, it was great!"
Very happy with this purchase.  Wubba is Grandson's favorite :-)
Cute
This is so cute! Very good quality.
Purchased these to add to our collection of MAM bottles. They work so much better than &#34;normal&#34; bottles. !!!
"The babe loves the bottles and the pacifier matches the bottle nipples perfectly. Happy baby, happy Mommy, happy family!"
I loved it! just as expected.
"This is my grandbaby's favorite pacifier and we tried several from other companies. Thank you for giving her something to hold onto. Now we have three, so if she loses one there is one waiting."
"We bought this to keep my son from launching his pacifier across the room when he ejected it.  It is cute and at 3 months, he likes to stroke the kitty's head and sometimes grabs the ears.  Sometimes he puts the kitty's foot in his mouth."
The only pacifier that our baby liked
Adorable! Can't wait to 'meet' my nephew and see him with a little mustache!!!! The pics will be priceless!
nice product!
I have given several of these as baby shower gifts. They are cute and useful.
Great quality.
We've been very happy with this so far! Works very well. It lights up and gives very accurate readings. Very user friendly. We've used it a few times. We've never had trouble with her taking it or keeping it in her mouth.
"Very good pacifiers, the only my baby loves. Used it from 6 months to 18 months. Easy to clean in dishwasher"
My 1 month old daughter absolutely loves this!
This is so funny and cute :)
These are so useful for night because you can easily see them in the dark.  Also useful for long plane trips.<br /><br />Hold the pacifier in bright light for a minute to recharge the glow.  It will glow all night.
very good
"This little lamb is so cute. It is my granddaughter's favorite pacifier, she loves holding it. It also comes apart so you can wash the lamb in the washer, which is nice cause it definitely gets dirty."
Babies love WubbaNubs!
"I have purchased these pacifiers so many times.  They are great for once baby is rolling around.  Once my daughter was only enough and rolling in her sleep, it was nice that these would stay in because they are rounded.  My daughter prefers these pacifiers to the nuk which I could never get her to take. The part that goes in baby's mouth is just like what most hospitals give so it was a seamless transition."
These are the best!!
"Love these pacifiers! Before he was born I got three types - Nuk, Soothies, and Mam - to try if he was indeed the pacifier type of baby. Nuk was immediately rejected, and he was so content with the Mam that we skipped the Soothies and gave them to the neighbor. He seems to like the less molded shape of the Mam nipple and has been a happy camper since. I'm not so impressed with the glow in the dark because they seem to not glow after an hour or two, even though I set them on the windowsill during the day - however we've found that if he has a couple pacifiers in his crib, he'll put them in himself now if he loses the one he fell asleep with - very nice way to offset the issue of the pacifier falling out and it needing to be replaced (usually by you!) at 4am. Thanks Mam!"
Babies love WubbaNubs!
"Hysterically cute.  Not sure how well it works, as it was a gift, but it sure was well received."
"Oh my lord this little guy is ubber adorable and TINY! My second baby is not here yet, but the item appears well made and is very soft and adorable."
"My daughter loves MAM pacifiers and I bought these to help her find them in the crib at night. I leave them on the kitchen counter while I make dinner and get her ready for bed (about an hour), and they glow all night long. It's actually pretty impressive, and it does seem to help her!"
"What a great deal on something that you'll always need tons of-and they are great, bright colors. I am so happy that I found these-and free 2 day shipping-so helpful!"
"Every baby seems to have their preferences for pacifiers, but this one stuck after we tried the soothie and Mam.  We used the soothie when she was a newborn, and then transitioned to this one at around 2 months.  We found this one to be the easiest for her to keep in her mouth.  Now she's 7 months and the little handles have become quite a toy for her to play with so she pulls it out of her mouth readily, but I imagine that would be the case with any brand."
Love this mustachifier of which i also bought a tuxedo onesie to go with it when the parents needed a must dresses outfit. Really cool.
Love our wubbanub! My little uses it to cuddle and it makes it a lot harder to lose. 
"We gave this to our daughter when she was just weeks old and it is still her go to comforter at 10 months.  I first saw it when my friends little boy had one and she swore by it.  The best thing about this pacifier is it's ability to keep the pacifier from bouncing all over the floor when it is dropped. It is all very &#34;baby friendly&#34; in that my daughter could grab it with her hands at a very early age and keep hold of it.  My plan to transition will be to remove the pacifier and give her the doggie if I can remove it without destroying doggie.  On another note, we bought a spare duck one but it fell apart (animal came off) within 3 weeks.  We then got a spare Clifford which seems just as good as the brown puppy.  The only negative is that many daycares will not allow them tough because of SIDS risk with any stuffed animals in crib."
"I love my mam products, they are so easy to clean and the microwave sanitation was a life saver when we went on vacations since almost every hotel has a microwave and I didn't have to bring along things to clean them with. They have held up very nice over the last almost eight months my daughter has used them. She loved these bottles straight from the start even with me breast feeding at first she took these right away. They do leak often, but I have come to realize it's almost impossible to find a bottle that doesn't leak. I also use the pacifiers by mam and she loved those as well."
Great
Safely holds pacifier and keeps it out of the dirt until it is needed.
"I'm a NICU nurse, and these are great!  I always buy them for my friends when they have a baby, and people rave about the fact that it keeps the pacifier in the mouth, or at least off the ground!  I love them."
"A very cute and meaningful pacifier. Makes baby content, makes adults giggle."
I got this as a baby gift for a friend. Hopefully her and her baby will love it. My little girl has 4 and is completely attached to them. These Wubbanub's are magic!!
best!
Best invention ever!!!
"These are the best pacifiers we own.  Inexpensive, no frills, and more effective than all the others we've tried."
These are great... Real hard plastic that my little puppy can't gnaw through when he steals them...these are the only ones I've found that are stronger than him!!
Love these things toy and pacifier in one. Awesome
Fantastic.
"My 2 month old takes them and I am happy knowing my baby has a natural-material product in her mouth. I only use the pacifier to help me in the car because I don't want to hear her wail.<br /><br />Anyway, spend the extra bucks and avoid plastic and synthetics!<br /><br />I sterilize by 5 min in boiling water ;)"
"Bought for grandson, transferred to granddaughter. I did not realize from picture this item has pink floral under bod. My son with male child forwarded to son with daughter. She loves it. No longer white. Loved too much."
value pack!  my little girl loves Nuk and they are one of the best pacifiers on the market!
Very good!
Baby finds binky at night = happy mom.<br /><br />Enough said!
"And we like how they glow in the dark. Now that she is finding them and putting them back in her mouth, the glow in the dark feature comes in handy.They work best when left under a light for a while."
"I love this binky!  Since it is attached to a monkey, I never lose it.  The monkey allowed me to &#34;prop&#34; it up so it stayed in my sons mouth and it's heavy enough that he didn't spit it out for fun, but could remove it if he wanted to.  I have washed it a couple of times by throwing it in the washing machine and it was basically dry when I took it out.  My son chewed through the first binky after several months, so I bought a second one.  After he chewed through that one I went to the store and bought the same brand of binkies, but instead of the newborn ones I got the 9+ mo (i think) and removed the old ones and sewed in the new ones.  Now I have backups and since he is done teething, he hasn't chewed through any more."
My 3 month old loves his monkey. Well worth it.
Was a very precious addition to our baby shower.
This is my husband's account but I had to come on and give a review. These pacifiers are great! They are hard to lose because of their size. Our daughter who is almost 5 months old is starting to learn how to guide it to her mouth because its big enough for her to  grab. She also uses the rim of the pacifier to chew on because she's teething so that's an added bonus in my book! I would highly recommend.
Every single wubby we have owned has been great! Love the wubbanub!
Great quality product.
Adorable!!
"only ones my daughter will use, best price ever!"
excellent!
Love them!!!
My baby boy loves these. He uses them all the time. When he wakes up in the middle of the night i give him the pacifier and he goes right back to sleep. Also when he is crying he stops crying when i give him the pacifier. Its also nice that it glows. Highly recommend to all mommies with babies. These are the only pacifiers that my baby liked. I bought him other pacifiers from other brands and he doesn't like them. These are the only ones so far that he likes.
Great!!
Love it
Great service. Love this pacifier
funny
"My breast fed baby will ONLY take these.  I wasted a lot of money on several brands of pacifier and gave up, thinking my baby just wouldn't take one.  My niece was born the following week, and one night in the middle of the night I was messaging with my sister-in-law and she messaged me a picture of the MAM, the pacifier that my niece had started taking reliably.  I thought, whatever, it probably still won't work, but we bought some anyway, and lo and behold!!!  So now we have three sets, pink, yellow, and the green glow in the dark.  We also have the 6 mos ones in a drawer ready to go, which are the same but with a longer nipple.  Love our MAM!!!"
"These are the BEST bottle out there for our baby.  This is the only nipple shape our daughter will take.  I was surprised that there are NO other bottles with this nipple shape.  I like the venting feature of these bottles and I like that there aren't too many pieces to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles I used for our first daughter - what a nightmare to clean!).  These bottles only have 3 large pieces to each bottle (in addition to the nipple and ring).  It does not require any kind of special cleaning brush.<br /><br />They vent wonderfully.  I like that you get two different sized bottles AND two pacifiers.  For $20, you can't go wrong with this gift set.  To buy each piece individually at the store would cost about $30.<br /><br />You do have to be careful with the temperature of your milk/formula.  If it's too hot, these bottles WILL leak.  Also, since these bottles are very thick, it takes a long time to warm up contents inside the bottle.  I prefer to warm up milk or formula in a breast milk storage bottle and then dump it into the MAM bottle when it's warm."
cute and seems to repel pee.
these work excellently in tandem with our cloth diapers.
"fantastic high chair, extremely portable and easy to clean.  best one on the market"
"i purchased these for my daughter to use when drying her face after washing. they make great facial clothes, because they are so soft."
"this is the best thing for young parents to have for their babies. sounds gross but it works so well and no, you don't get anything back into your mouth. gently sucks out their little noses well.  my daughter and daughter in laws all love it.  can't afford to be without one in your home when you have a young one that can't blow their nose yet."
great price for a great chair. nice and light but sturdy. easy to clean. my daughter is 8 months old and loves to sit in it and eat her finger foods in the kitchen while i cook. she's small for her age and the seat fits her much better than her high chair. highly recommend for travel and home user.
good size for little hands to hold.  good quality.  nice bright colors.  gave to my grandson at 6 months and he still chooses them to play with at almost 9 months.
"when i first started pumping, i cut holes into an old sports bra to use as a pumping bra. it worked but it was super annoying to use at work (who wants to pull a sports bra on and off two to three times a day at work?). i'm so glad i ended up buying this. it zips up, so i don't have to pull off my shirt or my regular nursing bra to get it positioned. the sizing is adjustable--that's why you buy the size s-xl. there's an adjustable panel on the back so it can fit just about any size. i am currently about a 36b/ 36c (depending on the bra brand--this is my nursing bra size). this fits great and really does allow me to do other things while i'm pumping."
"i love this wallet. holds everything, even my checkbook and cell phone. great purchase, and i would buy again. :)"
"this is the one to buy, as far as toddler step stools go.  easy for the 4yo to move around and use.  also sturdy and inexpensive. i wish i'd bought this one long ago."
fits my dream on me 3&#34; spring coil portable crib mattress perfectly. loved the design and nice and soft for baby. just what i was looking for.
"baby loves it too! this bassinet is sooo nice. love the cover and the see through mesh. our granddaughter<br />cried in the other models without mesh. it's sooo easy to assemble and great for people like us with a house<br />full of pets. mattress thin, but bought a thicker one, works great!"
great product.baby loves it non stop
this is an essential baby product. it makes bath time so much easier and fun!
"they look amazing, love it"
"cute then, cute now. my toddlers love their skip hop zoo lunch bags! held up well for over a year and still going strong! would definitely recommend!"
i bought this for my first grandchild and he and his mother love it. she told me she doesn't know what she'd do without it. he is 15 months now and has to use it every night. i'm so happy that we found it.
"not s nice as i expected, but ok"
"these are excellent seats.  highly-rated from both a safety standpoint and consumer happiness.  we have twins and had to buy two of these.  they're not the slimmest form, but they're not the widest, either.  in my 2013 wrangler unlimited (4-door wrangler) they take up a good portion of the back seat, but still leave enough room for our 8 year old daughter to reach the seat belt latch.<br /><br />in my wife's 2011 durango, they don't take up so much real estate that it makes my daughter uncomfortable to sit in the middle row, but the base does extend a bit over her latch and she has to push the seats aside in order to buckle her belt, which isn't easy to do considering how tight they're strapped to the seat.<br /><br />our boys are only 16 months old so they're still rear-facing.  the comfort, safety features, and even the design are top notch.  the boys are happy and comfortable and my wife and i are happy knowing they're safe."
gift loved
the costume was just darling. my granddaughter received so many compliments.
"one of my nine-month-old's favorite toys. great quality, keeps him busy."
"i knew i needed to buy one, but i had been putting it off for a long time. i just wasn't sure i was ready to commit to filling it day in and day out. and what if i didn't like it? i knew i wouldn't send it back and it would just sit in the basement collecting dust next to my ab lounger and thigh master. but, then one day i looked in the mirror and i didn't like what i was seeing. my skin was dry, my eyes red and my hair looked like i stuck my finger into an electrical socket. the final straw happened later that day when i bent down to pet my cat and the shock from the static electricity nearly killed my dear muffin! that was the moment i decided to take the plunge and plunge i did. i got right on amazon and ordered myself the safety 1st ultrasonic 360 humidifier in blue bc i knew if i stuck with it each day that there would be a special man in my life eventually and i wanted him to not only accept my safety 1st humidifier but to grow to love it. it was not long before things started turning around for me. no more flaking skin and fly away hair. and men who never gave me a second glance started saying, &#34;good morning&#34; in the elevator at work. i'm happy to report that 11 months later, my life has completely changed...for the better! i'm now married and we're expecting our first child...a boy...and yes, the safety 1st ultrasonic 360 humidifier will be on our baby registry!"
great fun for my granddaughter.
i couldn't like this more for my 3 yr old.  it does drip one tiny drop when first turned upside down but afterwards nothing comes out.  so it's not 100% leak proof but it does a great job overall.
very great product for the nursing baby!
"very nice , great quality, baby loves it"
awesome
"When I saw that there were only a couple elephant rattles left in stock, I decided to purchase it from my own baby registry and I am so thankful I did! This rattle is true to the picture and is very plush with a firm, round spot (the rattle) near the rump. I love that the rattle is inside the elephant so that the pieces can never become a choking hazard and that the shape of the rattle allows for multiple easy to hold places for an infant or toddler."
My daughter loves this paci & it is absolutely adorable!
Works well with our 4 month old.
Very durable and convenient design!
love football
My baby boy's favorite toy.  At 3 months old he is already &#34;kinda&#34; holding his bottles because of learning to hold his puppy.
cute
Great product!
My daughter's favorite pacis.
Great and easy to find for middle of the night wake ups!
We love the caterpillar wubbanub.  I first bought it to use mostly in the carseat (it was easy to reach back and grab it to give it to her (vs. digging around for the paci by itself).  Now she's very attached to it and we have a couple.  I love that you can throw it in a mesh bag and wash in the washing machine.  I've washed ours several times and it seems to be holding up well.  Would definitely recommend!
We were on the hunt for these..couldn't find them anywhere at the normal baby stores.. our son would only use this brand/design. Luckily there's amazon!!!<br /><br />Now we have a bunch and he's never without!
these are the best pacifiers on the market! they are flared at the top and bottom so they dont push into the babys nose or chin. love them!
I love the WubbaNubs in general. Helps the pacifier stay closer to my baby's mouth and he likes to touch the plush toy.
Very cute also.
Everyone likes to see a funny binky. Good material that won't break.
super cute and my daughter's favorite
"WubbaNubs are the best paci's every.  Easy to find when they slip away, cuddly, easy to clean, and fun for babes."
"very good, especially the born free bottles and the DHA"
I love this product. Its so easy for my grandchild find it and place it back in his mouth. They fit perfectly in his little hand.
My son loves his! It gives him something to hold onto and play with when he doesn't feel like sucking. I toss it in the washer with his clothes and it's good as new. I recommended these to everyone that I see with a baby.
"My 7 month old loves these pacifiers. I have tried others, but he just spits them out. They get an A+ from me!"
Great product. Easy latch. Love that it comes with a case. Perfect for on the go.
The only pacifiers my little one will use...this was the brand given to her in the hospital.  Easy to disinfect and cheap enough to replace if they get lost.  Love them.
If you have a baby or toddler they will absolutely fall in love with these. You will too. We love the monkey-binky and my son can't sleep without it. This is our third wubbanub too.
Our baby loves this pacifier since he was a newborn. We highly recommend it.
Gorgeous just a pity soother part not pink
"Naturally drawn to the bright red color, this is a great addition to out teething/pacifier collection"
Very cute & work great
My grandson love these Wubbanubs!
Excellent! Good material and fast delivery
Love love love this bag! Perfect for pacifiers and nipple shields!
This was my coworkers favorite and my stepsister's favorite for their kids. Great baby shower gift to give.
Super useful and unique I love
"Wonderful pacifier. I like the fact it closes before hitting the floor, which is quite common."
very good
As a baby my daughter did not care for the plush attached to her binky. Now that she is older (&#62;1 year) she adores it! And it makes it easy to spot the binky even in the dark! Now to get it away from her...
Fine
Best invention ever...
Very good
"Best invention ever! My daughter started using it right away and it is so nice when we're in the car, we don't have to worry about losing a pacifier during the drive!"
My little one loves her MAM. These are a cute print and color option.
Very good product.<br />I would definitely recommend it!
great paci!
"The friend I purchased this for said it was the best gift she received and that she couldn't live without it. I purchased both the monkey and giraffe, they have held up well and are easy to wash."
Very cute
"Love, love, love this pacifier!!  This is our second Wubbanub and our son loves both!  It is easy to keep up with and not hard to clean at all.  I can throw it in the wash and once it is done it is already almost dry.  I use our bottle warmer to sanitize the pacifier in between weekly washes.  This has also been a wonderful comfort item for him at night as we are transitioning him from his bassinet/our bed to his crib in his room."
"My baby will not accept any pacifier other than this brand.  We have them strewn about our house and cars.  As other reviewers have noted, it's pretty cute to watch that little &#34;o&#34; through the transparent nipple.  Tip for weaning them off of it when you finally need to: poke a hole in the tip---it's no longer as satisfying for them and they give it up themselves!"
It was a pain in the butt to try and find my daughter pacifier at night. But when I learned they had a glow in the dark pacifier I thought would it hold its glow all night?! And it did. I was surprised and happy. Great buy for us. We love mam!
Perfect game for the little ones to play
Adorable
Great price for bulk pacifiers.  Our dogs made a sport out of destroying Binky's.
Love it
"Im bummed to see so many negative reviews for this product. This is the easiest way to take my son's temperature. Its accurate against the other thermometers we use as well. I dont use the medicine pacifier because hes always been good about taking his medicine from the dispenser from his doctor. But seriously, so much hate for a 5 star product."
daughter loved them!
My 5 month old loves these!
Alittle bulky but my son loves it ! And it's super cute when he uses it !
Great gag gift at a baby shower.
very good!
"This has to be my favorite one, by far.  I just love this little dragon.  These WubbaNub's hold up very well. We have had this one for a year now and it is still in perfect condition even after many washes and being terrorized by a baby. :)"
Love love these:) had one for every baby I've had (3) and this one is a gift for a baby shower
Excellent product.  It arrived on time and worked as advertised.
Awesome! My newborn loves it. Even though he couldn't hold it when I got it. You can rest it so baby doesn't lose it as easily. Now he pushes it into his mouth and holds it in the crook of his arm and he's 8 weeks old. Recommend highly.
Was for sure a hit!!
"Product and service of excellent quality, I recommend to all"
good
So good!
Loved them.
Love it
The only bottles my breast fed baby will take! I love them and they come apart nicely to clean. It's great that you get two different sized bottles and two different sized nipples (size 1 and 2) with the set.
"i ordered this for my sons graco pack and play, it fits perfectly all around. when first opened i thought it was a little stiff so i jumped on it a few times and &#34;broke it in&#34;. the mattress itself comes in a casing that repels water but with a crib mattress cover and a sheet it doesn't make noise. he sleeps thru the night now...love it!"
she wants to look at the toys even when she isn't sitting in it!  this takes up quite a bit of space. would be nice to have the tray a little wider in 1 spot w/o toys so you could put a different toy or snack there.
"when our daughter outgrew her tiny love small mat with hanging toys we got her this. we still put the small mat on this because she likes to sit next to it and grab things. i took the advice of another reviewer and cut the stringed leaf teether off of the mat, just in case she rolls around with it and gets it caught around herself. she loves the teether all by itself anyway. it's a well made mat, and i like that it folds up pretty compactly to put away every night."
my 8 month old loves the music the sun toy plays. frog vibrates. turtle rattles. bright colors.
"printed with whey-based inks, gorgeous motif, and high quality wood, this made for a very impressive gift that was a big hit at a baby shower for my organic-minded, vegan niece who chose not to know the gender of her baby.  she ended up giving birth to a boy, but either way, i knew that this beautiful growth chart would be gender-neutral and wonderful for either boy or girl.  everyone loved it.  personally, i have used only wooden growth charts with my own children because they are longer-lasting, the ink doesn't rub off like with plastic or paper, and they become true family heirlooms."
"accomplished exactly what it was needed for.  bought this to keep house-training-resistant puppy in the office with me, so she couldn't defile floors in other parts of the house while i'm working. gently snaps shut so pup can't push it open, but it's  easy for the human to open and close. hinged gate keeps her in sight without making me climb over it to get in and out of the room. fits the door frame fine, and pretty easy to install."
my 6 month old love's it. the product is great.
"i bought this item for a new grandmother. i read a lot of reviews before i purchased it. a lot of customers stated that they waned to get a second. the bag is designed very well. i think i am going to get one for myself as i am away from home a lot. the inside has large & deep pockets on either side. in addition, there is one main compartment in the center. the changing pad leaves a lot to be desired but i purchased another one separately. this bag is so versatile that i really did not care about the changing pad. i stuffed the bag with various items before giving it as a gift."
great !!!!
"i read a bunch of reviews before decided to buy these nursing pads.  so happy i did!  they're comfortable, soft, wash well in the machine, they're a great choice.  i used coconut oil on my nips after each feeding when we were getting started & i haven't had any cracks or bleeding.  i think the combo of the oil & these pads saved me from the pain i've heard about from so many other women!"
"these bibs are amazing. easy to wipe off, can toss them in the dishwasher to clean also. the pocket catches everything. and it adjusts around baby's neck so that it can grow with them. i bought more to keep at my sitter's because i can not be without one of these at mealtimes!"
i thought this was a waste when i bought it. we have a blender already so what's the point? i couldn't have been more wrong. the convenience of having everything in one is awesome. it's a huge space saver and makes food prep a breeze.
"it was what my daughter-in-law was looking for for the twins,  the catch pocket and most of all the snap closure"
these came quick and were in new and undamaged condition. they are small enough for my newborn and look great!
great
"this little light works great. just enough light for our baby, but low enough not to keep anyone up. lasts several days, just in case you forget to plug it in, which is nice."
these were so soft! i love the colors. this was a very good deal.
great item
"daughter loves these, just like the ones from the hospital, but in pretty more girl friendly colors"
"These are great! My daughter had skin irritations with the regular Paci's that covered her whole mouth, but these worked great for her and allowed the irritations to clear!"
"my son loves this pacifier! before I purchased this he wouldn't take any other pacifier but once he tried this it was the only one he showed interest in, he didnt immediately loved it but the more he used it the more he got used to it."
Excellent!
great
Loved these!!
Hard to find in latex. Only so others any of my 5 babies would take. I love them.
It's my grandson's favorite!
My baby girl use these since she was born and I can only recommend.<br />We love this pacifiers
Good
"Our daughter has used these since birth and loves them.  Now that she's 6 months old, she uses them as a teether too!  We leave two in her crib during naps and at night... the shape allows her to easily find the pacifier, pick it up, and put it in her mouth.  Great product."
"Definitely my sons favorite pacifier!  We are strictly nursing and no problems with nipple confusion either.  Started using around 2 weeks old, and still successfully nursing with no confusion."
Good choice!
Good
"Great pacifier, great price"
"WubbaNubs are brilliant for infants. Not only are they adorable, but they keep the pacifier from rolling away when spit out, give me a chance to grab it if it falls, and helps keep the pacifier in or near the mouth. Also, my infant grabs onto it out of instinct when she really can't grab onto anything on purpose yet. Also, I really like saying &#34;pass me the dragon&#34; instead of &#34;pass me the pacifier&#34;."
EXCELLENT
"i bought this as a gift but the family loves the item and uses it multiple times each day.  i wish i had known these were around when my children were little.  it's a great cross between a swing and a bouncy seat since it offers the comfort of a bouncy seat, the rock of a gentle swing, and it's off the floor."
was a gift she seems to love them.
great for baby gift!
looked just like the picture.  the mom to be enjoyed gettingit!
fit the crib mattress well and was of high quality.
so easy to clean and transport. we are extremely happy with this booster seat.
adorable!  nice sized toy has great textures for little fingers.
"great toy for my daughter, she loves it! she knows who he is and holds him during the show. not her fav toy yet but def her number 2"
good.
"Natural, safe, and worry-free."
got them for my granddaughters :)
This was so fun. Even the men played. Great way to keep your guest entertained
I love these and so does my three month old. The shape feels more natural for him.
"Took a few weeks to arrive, but worth it!  So cute!!"
My baby loves this Pacifier. Great product
Nice!
This was a cute little pacifer for my grandson!
Sturdy and colorful. Stays where you put it.  Baby loves looking at it as well.
Exactly what I expected.
funny
VERRY GOOD
Only pacifiers the LO likes. We've reordered these many times.
Love this WubbaNub!  Bought these before and had to come back for more.
"Cute and my daughter loves them.  Wash well (in a toy sack in washer) and hold up well. When it was time to wean my older two daughters from the pacifier, we simply cut the paci off and they still had the animal as a lovie to make the transition easier. We plan on doing the same for baby girl number three."
came in early and was what was described.
"We went through so many others before our DS would finally take these.  He didn't like them over his face...these have a convex shape and he loves them.  If you have a PITA child who is super fussy and picky...give these inexpensive pacifiers a try!  Once we found these, he has been a different child!"
Love this product.
It makes your kid look like Mario...what more can I say?
"Nicu pacifier she was given..funny thing is that u cant find these orange ones anywhere in stores. I bought all the other gumdrop colors, but she would not take them. I discovered the silicone was harder on the other gum drop pacifiers. I really paniced because I lookes everywhere for these orange ones and couldnt find them so I was very happy I found on amazon, now that I am down to my last one.  These are great and she loves the softer silicone..so, if your baby is pacifier specific, dont waste your money on all the other colors like I did, if baby was given and uses the orange, purchase the orange because there is a difference."
"very strong, well made and large....front is so cute."
"we had a 30$ potty before this that had too much going on. i wanted a simple but effective product. this worked great for my boy. he enjoyed using this potty. it very simple, nothing fancy. it did it's job. also, my 3 year old was able to remove the insert and empty it himself.  for 8 bucks, i can't ask for a better product. highly recommend it!"
great bunny for granddaughter! matches her nursery perfect!
"sometimes it's the small things that are the most impressive. case in point, the glow in the dark feature on this little paci's! i thought it was a &#34;nice idea&#34; when i purchased them, only to realize that the practicality of them with my new little 4 week old newborn is awesome!!! i didn't realize how difficult it was for me to see at night when his paci is in his mouth, or if he's spit it out or pulled it out with his fist while sleeping. now i can quickly see if it's in his mouth. it glows just as bright as the photos show, if it is charged up in bright light (flashlight, cell phone, etc) prior to putting it in the baby's mouth. otherwise, it produces a very dim, low glow. you'd think that it's too low to see, until your eyes adjust to the dark at night, then you can see it clearly. the case they come in are able to have a little water added to the bottom and placed into the microwave to kill all germs on them. i personally like to clean them myself with hot soapy water, but that's just me. and they also have the same nipples as the mam pacifiers that we received in the hospital, which prevents nipple confusion. all around, i really love this little things and will get more if/when we lose either of the two we currently have."
"our one-year-old is an... enthusiastic eater, and these bibs have held up for about six months of daily use through all sorts of things - they catch food well and wash up easily, both by hand and in the washing machine. one thing of note - as she has gotten older, she has realized that her bib pocket sometimes contains delicious things, and so will pull the bib to get in to the pocket and it will no longer cover her fully. if it were somewhat wider, this wouldn't be an issue."
great products:) fast shipping .<br />thank you so much.
So easy and adorable.
"so cute!  My guy doesn't even take a pacifier, he just chews them, but he likes to hold the dragon while chewing."
"This is our second kitty, my baby loves it so much we needed two.  She has no problem putting it in her own mouth or sleeping with it."
"I got these over the Phillips and other pacifier. Those have a nipple that is slanted or has a flat end that is better for teething. I talked to a lactation specialist and she said the completely round ones are better for newborns because if you planning to breast feed, it imitates the nipple better. I liked this better because the &#34;shield&#34; has a cut out for the nose."
These pacifiers are the only ones my baby will take. They are thin and flexible so presumably will not affect her teeth coming in. Plus they come in really nice designs. I would buy these again and again!
"My favorite type of paci to get for my babies.  They like latex because they also nurse and it feels more like skin. Silicone is too plasticky, so I always get latex. My kids wouldn't even take a different paci."
"Perfect, just make sure you don't use this in front of your wife...mine didn't like it."
"Bought this one for my niece. My daughter has the elephant one, and it's so cute. She'll hold onto the plush toy and try to get it back in her mouth after she spits it out."
"WubbaNubs are the best. They make the binkies harder to lose, easier for the baby to grasp and put back in their own mouth, and less likely to fall out of the crib onto the floor (although it still happens, I suspect on purpose). And it would make it easier to keep track of whose is whose, if I hadn't long ago given up on trying to keep the twins' germs separate. And of course they are so cute (the WubbaNubs I mean...but also my babies of course)!"
"Unexpectedly, it looks very stylish, better than other colors for my boy."
"Perfect fit for baby's hand. Soft and graspable. Wash and air dry. Although I have washed and dried these in a standard washing machine. Easier to catch if thrown toward the floor, and children can identify who's WubbaNub is who's. I recommend having 2 of each animal per child."
"The only binki for my babe, it soothes and it works, others that boast of being a similar shape to a nipple have not worked for him and because they are 2 pieces vs 1 solid piece they seem to get lint and randomness trapped at the seem of the nipple and the face with the flap....which as a new mom, who likes things clean and sanitary, I'm not a fan of."
super cute
"This little guy, (or girl), is absolutely adorable! My grandchildren loved it and so did the parents. I received it quickly and package nice. Thanks Amazon ! You just can find this kinda stuff in stores very often."
"One of our favorites! This was a lifesaver in the early days with our baby - it's a cute toy that provides visual interest to the baby with the fun patterns, but it was also great because it would stay in place when the pacifier fell out of her mouth and she was usually able to get it back in on her own. Great for situations like driving when you can't get back there to replace a fallen pacifier! I give these as gifts to my friends now when they are expecting. I especially like the Mary Meyer series because they are a little cuter than the standard Wubbanubs."
"My son LOVES this. He has three of these in different animals. They make it turbo easy for him to put his own nuk back in his mouth. They are hands down his favorite, go to toys. He has liked them since birth, but has grown more and more fond of them and at 7 months, adores them. I highly recommend these."
"Works great for our breastfed baby, whereas regular pacifiers got spit out instantly"
"The WubbaNub is a must have whenever I put together a baby shower gift! I have yet to meet a baby that doesn't fall in love instantly with their WubbaNub! The design allows them to cuddle a soft, squishy stuffed toy while getting comfort from their binky at the same time. I find that with WubbaNubs you end up with much less of the pacifier being thrown on the floor too. They don't want to give it up!"
LMAO
One of my daughters favorite pacifiers
LOVE IT!! Perfect size for newborn. He loves it!
good
good
fit my graco pack and play just like a glove.  would buy this again if it wears out before i'm done with the pack and play.
love everything about this stroller
"these bottles are awesome. we've tried several different brands and these are the only ones my twins seemed to really like. the big size is definitely a plus, they eat more than what our smaller medela bottles can hold now. we had to buy slow flow nipples however because the mediums made them choke."
great solution for storing bath toys.
i love it
nice and sturdy
"cute pattern, but this is not 100 percent cotton, as advertised. it not that big a deal, so we use it, but i really was looking for 100 percent cotton."
"this diaper bag is the perfect transition for a. my other diaper bag that finally bit the dust with a broken zipper and b. it's a convenient size that is small enough but enough room to fit a few cloth diapers, straw sippy cup in front, wipes, wet bag, shoes, extra set of clothes and snacks! also, bonus! it has strap loops on the sides so i just attached the strap from my old bag and ouila! it's a messenger bag. but the straps on the bag itself are a great length as well. i'm very happy with this bag and the price isn't too bad either as it can double for traveling later. :) plus the print is just on point. even better than the picture."
very pretty
love these!
love it.
My daughter has loved these Soothies since birth and having colors other than the ubiquitous green is a godsend for daycare so she doesn't end up with another baby's pacifier. We probably have 20 of these stashed throughout our house and in our cars to be sure we're never caught without one nearby.
very cute and the kiddo likes it
excellent product / doesn't smell like plastic / great design / plant-based / baby loves / fyi: it's supposed to slightly cover babies nose to mimic the breast / 5 stars
"This worked great! I have the ear and forehead thermometers and both are pretty inaccurate. This one worked great first try! The only thing is the nipple is a bit longer and skinnier than the nuk brand my kids are used to, but my daughter didn't even make a face."
Perfect for cleaning bread pump parts without being as expensive as breast pump wipes
Cute
"These are awesome until your vhd can chew them, or the dog -_- none- the less I've purchased at least 15 of these from them being destroyed or lost. They're a great product highly reccomend them. Wish I could get my two year old to stop taking a paci though (yea they're that good)"
"Received in a very timely manner and the Momma to be love, I paired it with a skull pacifier."
"Good product for newborns.  Nice, softer pacifier.  Cute colors."
Best binky ever!  Used them for my son and now my daughter... A must have for new parents.. I buy them for everyone who is expecting
"This is the only pacifier that would stay in my grown son's mouth, when he was a baby.  His grandson took after him.  Best pacifier ever : )"
Best invention. My daughter loves it
I wish these had been around 20yrs ago!! Great way to get an accurate oral temperature for infants and toddlers!!
Very funny brought lots of laughs
I love it.  My son is able to hang on to it or put it back in his mouth and it does not go flying to the ground when he spits it out.
Good stuff......Recommend for you
Exactly what I was looking for! Perfect!
So cute! My daughter loves it!
Just beautiful! I am very happy with the quality of this pacifier! :) Would definitely buy more!
My 4 week old can keep these in for a while on her own. Some she won't take some fall out easily but these seem to be doing the trick! Love that they glow in the dark!
favorite pacifiers
"These are the BEST pacifiers.  Solidly made, one-piece molded silicone.  They are not huge and round like the Soothie brand.  Nice shape to fit a baby's mouth perfectly.  Loved the newborn ones and paid extra just to be able to use these orthodontic ones as she got older.  Recommended by many hospitals.  If i have a second child, i will definitely be using this brand again!!"
These are amazing - newborn has loved them since she started using them. They definitely sooth her. Now we are buying the rest of the sizes for the months to come. Great purchase !
Confome combined! Within expectations. I loved it!
"My baby loves it, so we love it too! The only pacifier she would take!"
"My daughter uses only these pacifiers, they're great. However when i bought it i wanted girl's colours, but i received boy's colours. I live in Brazil so i had to accept it."
We loved our &#34;molly monkey&#34; until the dog stole it and ate the nipple off the pacifier.  super cute.
Good
"People say you shouldn't use pacifiers on a baby. Yeah, right. And you shouldn't put a muffler on your exhaust, it restricts power. Try that one and see what the cops do. If you want to remain sane, buy some of these. Each baby is different, these are the only pacifiers my baby likes. Don't ask me why. Your baby might be different. Try them if you're baby is making your eyeballs look like a plate of spaghetti."
"Great seller, greatest item I've ever seen. reasonable price!<br />my baby loves it! MUST BUY!"
"amazing, my daughter loves these and their hard to lose."
These were great for my one year old.
Amazing when your daughter needs to self soothe during the night. Regular pacifiers I can't find them without turning the light on. MAM pacifiers are the only pacifiers that my daughter will accept. It's soft for her little mouth.
All natural
perfect
Perfect for baby!
LOVE!!! I've had 5 kids...Idk why I didn't think of this....but I'm glad someone did. So far it actually stays in place for me(us). They are adorable but even more so when your baby has it on her little chest. A tiny stuffed cuddly animal for a tiny new person. I'm ordering more for sure! ;)
Great! Our daughter loves these!
Best pacifiers ever - I buy them for all my friends with babies!
very nice book.
"we absolutely love this booster seat! it doesn't slip (even with a toddler who never stops moving), it's a great height, and it's easy to clean."
my niece loved it!  fast shipping.
"my little boy loves his pillow! it is very soft, and just the right size for him, although he still ends up sleeping next to it most nights. i bought the two pack of blue pillow cases to go with it, and they fit perfectly."
excellent hands free pump bra.  it is secure with many size options.
these are great to have in the car.
i love this gate. easy to use. wish it were taller....for the same price.
"excellent stroller! i love it, good quality for good price!!!! i have two kids and i recommend this stroller for all parents!"
fast delivery and happy with product for my daughters first christmas present :-)
great giveaways...
"this sterilizer is so easy to use, clean, and re-use!"
these zippy cups don't leak and are easy for little hands to grip. highly recommend these for your little one.
this product work fast and is amazing!
these are amazing for heavy wetters! my son pees through almost everything and this gets us by each day without having to change his outfit with each diaper change! i love them! highly recommend
my daughter loves this and has been great for teething!
great experience. would order from seller again.
Our changing table is short so it was nice to find this 30&#34; (as opposed to 32&#34;+) pad. Has attachments for the changing table so it won't slide off. Has worked just fine for us through two babies. No signs of wear or holes or anything.
So cute!
"I really like the pacifier, however it is a little big for my 5 month old. He is almost 20 lbs, so he is bigger and it is still too much for him. I am anxious for him to grow in to it because I am very happy with the pacifier and quality."
"Love it! My Baby girl especially loves on her crib. Very soft, easy to grab and put I her own mouth. Very pretty colors."
"Purchased these for our new baby that should be coming in November. We plan to take them to the hospital with us to use. We received some from the hospital with our first daughter, but since moving overseas and now giving birth at a military hospital we found out they discourage bottle feeding and pacifiers and won't provide these. Our first daughter loved it so we decided to get a set for our new one."
Great product and fast shipping!
Love these things and so does my baby.
Great product and fast shipping!
"My daughter loves these! She wanted nothing to do with the Philips Avent freeflow or soothie pacifiers. I purchased this pacifier after reading about it in the Moms On Call:0-6 months book. She is able to hold them in her mouth without sucking, which is great when she falls asleep with them. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find them."
These are the only pacifiers my son will use; the designs are really cute and they're really durable
my grandchildren love these so much. these are wonderful
"I have 2 diaper bags, a big one and a small one, so this is perfect for me. I can easily move it from one diaper bag to the other. It easily holds 2 pacifiers and it's made very well. The quality is great and the snap on the handle is very good. I would definitely recommend to everyone!"
"Our child likes these pacifiers very much.  He has never needed to try any others, so I can't comment on them compared to some others."
"My daughter LOVED these binkies!!! Great price, great product, and fast shipping! I'll be ordering these again for my next baby!"
My grandson loved this since his older brother called him froggy.
Its like a nipple. Obviously he is gonna like it better than the other cheap plastic ones. Doesn't stay in his mouth very well though and you can see them sucking on it through the hole its kinda funny.
These adorable little critters have always been a hit with my little girl.  It's probably bad to say but she's two now and I'm still buying them for her to love on.  There soft cuddly and absolutely adorable.  Good quality and hold up through a pretty rough two year old.
Super cute and orthopaedic pacifier
How I went many years without this when my kids were growing up I will never know! These are awesome!!
"Love this item, my grandson has the cow and red dog. He loves them"
"Seriously, this WubbaNub has SAVED me!!  My daughter was never super attached to her paci, but when she did take it, she preferred the Soothie. She really stopped sucking on a paci around 2 months old.  She started using the pacifier just to chew on as a teething toy at around 6 months, so I got her the WubbaNub, because it seemed like it'd be easier for her to handle.  Lo and behold, she started sucking on like it was some new discovery!! It calms her when she's upset, and she absolutely loves this still at 8 months old!  And since it makes her happy, it makes me happy toond gets a 5 star rating!"
The people love this pacifier.
Good Product
Excellent
Excellent
"I loved these pacifiers more and more as my baby got older. He used it regularly as a newborn, and as he started teething he would turn it sideways and chew on the side, which can't be done with a paci that has a hard plastic curved piece."
The pacifier was a hit with my granddaughter!  She loves to hold on to the plush little animal!  It's just adorable.
My grandson loves this.  Goes right to sleep.  Calms him down
Works great! My son loves them.
These are the best pacifiers. I love that they are girly colors too!
Very cute and functions as needed.
"Ive said it before, but we LOVE these pacifiers. Easy to find and hold and its a built in lovey. Got this one for a friend who just had a baby and hoping her daughter will love it as much as ours does."
Very cute! Love these colors!
"I love that these pacifiers are made in one piece, with no nooks or crannies for dirt, fluids, or food particles to get stuck in.  Washing is a breeze."
"My seven month old loves this toy.  I thought it looked silly, but bought it anyways.  Well worth the purchase.  We attach it to his car seat handle so it dangles in his face.  He loves grabbing the pacifier and putting it in his mouth.  Even when he has other toys and pacifiers in the car seat with him, this is his &#34;go to&#34; toy/pacifier.  You put in your favorite pacifiers, and can change them out when he goes up a size."
this is great to keep an extra pacifier inthe diaper bag. if you use soothies it will only fit one
"These are the kind we got in the hospital and the only kind my son would take. There are other pacifiers that are similar, but are a little more stiff and he wouldn't take them. These are a favorite. Our local store is always out of stock so I don't even bother looking there anymore."
Best pacifiers period
yes great pacifer by far... taste and smells yummy.. Rowan loves it..
So cute and my grandbaby loves them.
Perfect
Excellent
"Great smoothie. It's a hit and miss for my littke one. I'm a first time mom so maybe I'm still learning. Out of the other pacifiers we've (nuk and chicco),this one works the best for us. Our baby prefers this one and it's the one that our hospital provides as well. Wouldnt recommend introducing to newborns who are being breastfed until they've established their breastfeeding routine."
"My granddaughter was very fussy when not being held, i bought this in hopes it would help her keep a pacifier in.  it worked beautifully.  she is such a happier, more content child now being able to self-soothe with this pacifier that stays put because of the stuffed animal. she loves to hug it while she sleeps as well.  she is too young to grab normal pacifiers and put them in her mouth when they fall out, but this one says right outside her mouth when she relaxes and lets go our she moves.....very easy for her to put it back in. i would def buy another wubbanub in the future."
Cannot wait for my niece to use this. So adorable!
"Great price, colors vary but I don't mind. Anything that makes my son stop crying and is BPA free works for me!"
Perfect
the seller sent the towel very quickly. it's our favorite for our little one . it's so soft and absorbent but not bulky like most cotton towels. we all love it
love this turtle.  my son falls asleep to it for every nap and at bedtime.  works like a charm.  the waves are really cool.  i would definitely recommend this.
easy to put on and looks adorable!! absolutely love these decals. i even have textured walls an they still stick wonderfully and look great. they can be re-positioned but some of them did pull a little paint so i would be careful and try to only place once if possible. i got a few of them and the room looks awesome.
perfect
wonderful cups! can withstand my kids treatment as well as the dishwasher!!! will be ordering more soon!
it's my granddaughters favorite!
"this is my favorite gift for baby showers. these cards are beautiful, and newborns love to look at them! they also make great nursery decorations."
cute and fun and works very well. i can't imagine not using a thermometer for baby's bath as i get paranoid with water temp. this product is great. gives you temperature in celsius also if needed.
"we have bough three types of these cabinet locks.  these simply work the best, are the easiest to install.  you can &#34;overbend them&#34;, if you &#34;groove&#34; your cabinet from wear, and they seem to stay working for another couple weeks.  i'm keeping a few extra on hand, to replace the older ones you get from home depot/lowes, that are just more cheaply made.  these are larger, and stronger, and the adhesive just works.  seems to come off easily as well, with a hairdryer."
"these are great and an essential part of our gameday gear!  our baby loves them, and never tries to grab at them or remove them so that is key!  i tried them myself (took them off the headband and held them over my own ears) and they do work - they do a nice job of muffling everything around you.<br /><br />can't tell you how many times we've been told 'that's so smart' or 'thank you for protecting their ears!' by passersby - it truly makes you feel like a good parent!<br /><br />way better than the other headband-style option that looks like a fabric sweatband wrapped around your kids head/forehead!  our baby hated that feeling and tried to knock them off in seconds!!  this is a much better solution!"
"at first, i was going to give these four stars because the plastic is a lot thinner than other stacking sets. however, the price was great and my kids use them in the sand and water table. there are holes at the bottoms of the cups and the kids love turning them upside down and seeing the air bubble out. these cups also make great number stamps to use in the sand or with play dough."
"purchased as gift, she loved it!"
None available.
perfect!
very durable and easy to wash. my son uses it about 3 times a week. no complaints.
"these blankets are all you need unless it's really cold out.  forget receiving blankets, nursing covers, a car seat/stroller cover for shade, because these can work for all of those uses in addition to swaddling.  i love that they're huge, slightly stretchy and breathable.  the patterns are unisex and simply elegant."
makes it very easy to clean the tube in the bottle
love this chair. it's really sturdy and can handle anything a toddler will do to it. wipes clean easily.
looks awesome! seems strong.
"absolutely the best jogger stroller i have used and is not bulky for storage in your car.  easy to fold, take apart and put back together."
good.
"wife loves it, which means its a good thing."
"i have used this system before, purchase the newborn set in store and absolutely loves it. my daughter can't give up the bottle yet because it offers the comfort of the breast. this may be my last purchase but its all worth it."
works great at keeping my son from trashing the back of my seat in my new car. you can hardly notice its there since i have a black interior.<br />study and stays in place.
"i was very happy with this crib skirt.  the color was a little darker then shown, but looks very pretty."
excellent
way better price than retail and ebay
"these pants are great!  i tried one set out, then went back for 3 more.  i have a total of 4 pants and 9 liners. i end up washing them every day or 2.  most training undies allow wetness to get everywhere, ending in a new outfit. these provide an extra level of protection to avoid outfit changes, wet sofas, wet rugs, or whatever your toddler is sitting on.  child still feels wet in these and since they look like undies, your child feels like a big kid.  i really like these for car rides and shopping trips.  these are not meant to be a diaper, so if your child pees a lot, they will still leak, but no where near as bad as most other training products on the market."
these are a must have for anyone with babies!  we used them for both kids and have purchased them for shower gifts. they aren't the cutest gifts but super functional!  we use them also in our diaper bags since they are lighter and less bulky to carry than the changing pad that came with the diaper bag.
so far so good.  seems to keep baby warm and covered.
"i have a baby with acid reflux and realized i kept on lifting the back of my heel up to keep her at an incline with her boppy pillow.  after my heel started throbbing in pain one day, i saw this pillow and gave it a shot.  well worth the money spent!  i love this pillow and so does my daughter.  she falls asleep comfortably on it after feeding and has a natural incline so my heel can take a break now.  i highly suggest this pillow.  and i even had to throw it in the washer and dryer after the first few days and it washed very well."
this was a great product arrived quickly.
"This is really great , it oprotects your pacifier from everything, and could even put it in the sterilizer to clean it. The material is great and looks like very durable, im actually buying a second one. Firdst i did not like the coler but them I realize it was good to see when in a messy room"
Received quickly and was what I expected!
Excellent
"These are one of my go-to baby shower presents. They are not only cute, but functionally, they keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth better than most other pacifiers because they are weighted with the stuffed animal. My sister recycled these for her 4 kids and highly recommends them. When they need to be cleaned, just throw them into the washing machine with some clothes."
Love it

The best! Glow in the dark so we can find them! And reversible
Excellent
"These are the only pacifiers that my son doesn't immediately drop.  The way the pacifier forms a bulb at the tip makes it easier for him to get a good grip on it, so it doesn't fall out until he spits it out.  I should note that we've been using these since my son was a few days old even though they are listed for 6 months and up.  He couldn't really get a grip on the newborn Mam pacifiers, they are shaped differently."
it's good.
"Baby didn't use a pacifier until he started teething, and these work perfectly as a teething tool.  They are chewy and flexible, and have no hard plastic or weird odors.  We love them!"
Nicely made and cute for baby to hold
it's good.
"Cuteness. Every little girl, if they are going to have a paci, should be seen with pink and purple. It really does make a difference.  I took the green one out, plopped the pink one in, and I swear she smiled bigger, as if she just knew it was pink and perfect for her."
"We. Are the decision to avoid pacifiers for our son, but decided that we should have one just in case. These are great. The only time I truly needed to have them in hand was when we were in a 5 hour flight. They kept my son quiet and made for a much more relaxing trip than we had anticipated"
"Shaped like nipple, doesn't cause nipple confusion. My baby was given one of these from  hospital so we bought extra for house. It's the only kind she likes. The Avent ones that look similar are a harder plastic and she won't take them."
Great product
Great product
So cool!
Does the job :)
"It took a while but now at almost eight months, WubbaNubs are all our little one will use.  She would use them occasionally early on but now they are her go to when she is just tired or ready to nap.  They are easy for her to find in the crib in the middle of the night.  Months ago, they were nice in that they kept it up by her mouth."
Very Handy!  So glad I purchased it!
"We love Wubbanubs in this house. The animals help weigh the pacifier down so it is much less likely to escape the child's reach, are a perfect fit for little hands to grip, and provide a source of amusement for young infants. Essential for car-rides and nap time. Plus, the animal makes it much easier for parents to spot as sometimes it seems like you never can find a pacifier when you need one.<br /><br />The only downside, is you cannot sterilize these like you would a loose pacifier. However, they do hold up rather well in the washing machine. And if your child becomes particularly attached to the animal, it is possible to remove the pacifier and stitch the open seam closed again."
Cute and holds blinky longee

Good pacifiers!
very nice
I absolutely love the wubbanubs and my son does too. The dragon is by far my favorite and my son loves to hold onto the legs and wings. I just wish I could change the pacifier out. Other than that I love it. I think they were worth the price even with how much my son loves them! I would recommend buying 2 though for when one is dirty.
"WubbaNub Lamb has become the favorite soothing pal for my little 8 month old daughter.<br />Up until this month she never took any paci<br />WubbaNub lamb has become her pal, she carries it and holds the little legs as she chews the rubber part.<br />Easy to clean.<br />Have washed this thing 5x in a few weeks - washes nice each time.<br />small enough for little hands.<br />soft and cute for little ones who are teething."
We have several Wubbanubs. They have become one of my daughter's favorite things in the world. They are the perfect size for her little hands.
Love it and so does my son.  Super cute!
Excellent!!!
Great
"My son loves this product!!! Need I say more? Needless to say, we are happy customers. Thank you!!"
Bought foe baby cousin. They love them
"So funny, cute shipped quickly"
"Keep in mind these are for 3 month old babies! They are not the hospital gumdrops (Hawaii Medical). My daughter loves these. I'm not keen on how they looks, it's not really the cutest thing to see a tunnel in your child's mouth. But they help her sleep, therefore I love them. :)"
"Good product good price. Where was this thing100 years ago when, I was a baby?"
Cutest thing ever and my lo loves it! it's so easy to find at night when he pops it out and cries for it.
good price It's what the baby likes enuf said
"They really do glow in the dark, which is a wonderful thing when it's the middle of the night and you're delirious from sleep deprivation.  Highly recommend!!!"
Great for kids ....
Great product ....
"These are the only pacifiers that our baby liked and can keep in her mouth. I know a lot of people don't like how they have to be right side up, but that never really bothered us. Not only does the picture show which way is up, the shape of the paci itself is another indicator. Sometime our baby puts it in herself upside down, but it doesn't bother her... or she'll turn it the other way herself."
These are super cute. I bought them for my grandson and he loves them.
"I never thought it would be so useful to have a glowing pacifier, but believe me you will need it when your baby wakes up crying and you cant find your pacifier in the dark :)"
My grandson loves these!  Easy for him to grab! :)
Awesome
perfect matched the babyshower theme.
EXCELENT THANKS
worked as described.  very good product.
gently used. perfect condition. all accessories present and in perfect condition. can start as rear facing infant seat and convert to front facing toddler seat. instruction booklet included. installation realitively easy. secures child well.great purchase.
the  children  love  eating  off of this.
"for all those moms out there that get frustrated with a bulb suction, this suction device is probably the best way to go. you can get huge plugs out of your kid, and (at least for my kid) it doesn't make her as upset as a typical bulb suction will. the filters work well, and i've never had an issue there.<br /><br />the system is also very easy to clean, and the best part is that you can see through all of the parts. bulb suctions make me nervous because you can never tell what is going on inside of them even with proper cleaning. bulb suctions are still good for some stuff, but for everything else i use the nosefrida."
i ordered both the toddler pillow and the toddler pillow case.  both are really great.  i am a senior citizen and since my hip replacement surgery i sleep best in my recliner.  i ordered the pillow (and case) for my own use.  i love the way my head sinks into the center of this luxurious little pillow prohibiting my head to fall to one side or another during a deep sleep.  misalignment of head and shoulders during the night was causing me neck problems which led to vertigo (a rather frightening malady).  the fabric and general construction of these items is top notch.  i plan to purchase a second pillow case.  the size is perfect for my needs.
"love this mobile! i was so excited to find this gem on amazon, since it is no longer sold in stores (i didn't find it at least) my daughter had one exactly like this 11 yrs ago, and i was so excited to find it once again for my new little one. this one is even better than i remember! you and your little one will enjoy it :)"
it's great
love it
a+++ perfect
i was looking for a slim high back booster for my 3rd row seating. this is perfect. makes putting 3 kids in the back row much easier.
great solution!
"this necklace looks like a piece of jewelry! it has a really nice color to it, and can be worn by either a boy or a girl. i really like that it all-natural, with no dyes or pharmaceuticals added ?kids could chew for hours and not ingest anything unsafe. the material and construction feels very high quality ?when you pull at the string, you'll feel that ths necklace won break, no matter how hard an overly eager baby may pull at it! this also means that the necklace presents less of a safety concern, since it seems impossible for the beads to be pulled apart and swallowed by accident. the beads themselves are genuine amber, and also feel very durable, and will withstand really strong, forceful bites. teething children will have a great time, and parents will feel confident that their children will be using a safe product. overall, this is a great alternative to other teething products out there. not only is this necklace all-natural, but it also has immune system-boosting properties and actually helps children feel better through the teething process. great product!"
these stickers are well made and super cute!  so far we have used the one month one and really enjoyed having it! the older children are having fun taking the pictures!
wonderful product. we love it.
"the babies in my sunday school class love this toy. they actually fight over the balls that come with it, so it's great that it comes with 3 of them. they don't get bored of it like other reviewers babies, but that might be because they only get to play with it once or twice a week. i would definitely recommend it for a daycare/sunday school setting though."
Thx really cute but didn't look like how it did in the pictures
EXCELENT THANKS
Love these adorable pacifiers!
This monkey pacifier is extremely cute & appears to be well made.
I have used these with both of my children...they were great for my kids.
Excellent
Actually my granddaughter loves it.  Bright color makes it easy to find.  She loves her WubbaNubs.
Funny!
My 7 month old daughter still loves this great paci!
My daughter loves these. We got two when she was born at the hospital but needed more to have around the house and in her diaper bag.
My little guy is just impressed by this great item.
The hospital gave us this kind of pacifier and I pushed it to the side until I saw another friend's baby using the pacifier with the wubbanub. My newborn reacts a lot different to this style pacifier and it calms her much quicker. I can tell that she loves the feeling of the dog as well. I like that the wubbanub keeps the pacifier from falling when she is done with it. I wish I had used this when she was born.
Exactly what I expected.
Great!
My baby prefers the nipple style on these Avent pacifiers and we were pleased that they were not the slanted nipple style as we read not to give those as it can cause latch issues in breastfeeding babies (not sure if that is true but as new parents it's what we went with).
All products were great
Best thing ever
"This was a gift, but in the past we have loved our wubbaNubs!"
The best pacifiers out there. We got this with our oldest son in the hospital 13 yrs ago. Now they make them for people to purchase on their own. We buy this for every babyshower gift we give away.
"Best binkies ever! They close when dropped. But because of the small holes on the side, we put the binkie clip elastic through the closing part, so that it stays half open, that way my 11 month can put it in his binkie by himself!"
love it
Amazing pacifer
very durable. we like it
Essential baby product! My son loves to play with the little dog while sucking on the soothie. Easily to clean with mild soap and water.
"We love the brand and we love the price! Reputable brand. My advise is change regularly.<br /><br />We also got the night ones, glow in the dark:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L2SA3A?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B001L2SA3A&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=GF7RSUBA6H7S4S25<br /><br />Cheers!"
Great pacifiers!  Worth every penny.
Excellent idea
Cute and is a binky bought for child of Pittsburg household. Go browns
As always wubbanub to the rescue. :) My friends newborn loves it. There is no chasing the bike constantly with these!
Love love love wubbaNub! My twins love them and so do I! Easy to find in the middle of the night when the baby is crying and you are dead tired! We have about six of these now and my twins are 3 months old and love grabbing the little animals!
I love this!  got it for my daughter(3 wks old) and the stuffed animal really helps nubbie stay in place instead of falling like it normally would. i recommend it
good
My son and daughter in law loved them!  Thank you!
This pacifier is the cutest thing ever!  My grandson loved it!
"We bought this in hopes that it would be easier to find the pacifier. And it is! It can't get as lost with the little lamb attached. Another bonus is if she drops it or throws it the pacifier doesn't go rolling away (we have hardwood floors) and it's easier to grab when you can get a hold of the lamb. Picture sitting all perfect in your rocking chair in the dark and baby throws or drops it and you try to do a ninja move to grab the pacifier, this makes it easier! You can get a hold of the lamb with your toes if it comes to that, and it will.... It's also harder for it to fall out of the crib in the middle of the night :) And of course she loves the cute little lamb!"
So adorable.
Both my babies love MAM pacifiers!  They are great for newborns and contour to Thayer face for a secure sucking
"These are the same model we got from the hospital.  The clips don't work on these, but my daughter liked this model the best.  These are also available in an older size.  The older one is a bit stiffer, so I'd consider those as you will get more time out of the product.  Same company and same colors."
I bought these to keep my daughters lips from chapping. They are great for that. We had some previously that were open like this and they were great she just wore them and so these were replacements.
"Purchased these when looking for replacements for our Hawaii Medical Gumdrop pacifiers. I ended up preferring these to the Gumdrops, as did my infant. They are just a bit softer and much lighter so they don't tip out of a tiny one's mouth quite so easily when not actively being sucked upon."
"These are the only pacifiers my 3 1/2 month old son likes (been using them since he was 2 weeks). Good price and easy to clean, the clear ones can be hard to locate though sometimes once I put them down."
Gave this as a shower gift.  It was on her registry.  The was very excited to get it
This is exactly what my baby needed. It's easy for her to hold the paci and friend. Much better than the other paci animal that is more popular.
My son only likes MAM. We've tried other brands but this is the one he always asks for. Carry case/sanitizer case is great and convenient for travel.
The best pacifier EVER !!!!!
Nice product
Perfect!!
Great product
"What can I say, these are very cool.  I bought them a little early, as my daughter is not able to use them quite yet.  The nipple end of these are made for a little older baby (and mine is new yet), so she is on the young ones still.  They are really cool looking and I can't wait for her to start using them."
Pretty much a waste of money at $9 but is very cute and funny. Could be used as part of a Halloween costume.
excellent
Actually use this size from 0-9 months so far. She doesn't like any others.
Great. Only pacifier my baby will take.
"my baby loves them and by the way even though she is 10 months, she prefers these to 3+ mo, she likes that they are soft. She has teeth for like 4 months and never bit it through or anything."
Baby no longer has pacifier.  Sad to see her growing up.  She loved WubbaNub
"This is a must! We've raised many children and trying to take temperatures on infants can be a chore. This thing is very accurate, construction is great and it comes with a cover for the nipple. So far, it's been very quick and reliable. Plus, the price is pennies!"
"Love this! It's big enough to fit 2 of the Avent soothie pacifiers.<br />The plastic is very durable, and the clasp is strong so it stays closed."
Best thing they have came out for infants
"Do wish it had a clip, but very cute"
Funny little item
"This was my granddaughter's fav so far - but she loves ALL her wubbies!!! She calls for them & if she drop one she says &#34;Oh Nooooo, Wubbieeeeeee&#34;. LOL"
Received quickly.  Ordered as a gift.  Parents thought it was very cute!  Baby has yet to be delivered to try pacifier.  Gave 5 stars for cuteness!
My 3 month old son and this giraffe are now inseparable! He loves it!
"My son loves these pacifiers.  Every other brand he spits out, but these are great.  They also have a little space around the mouth, so that spit doesn't collect."
The only bottles my son would take! love them!
Best pacifier ever!
"son loves these. used with my daughter too.<br />For breastfed babies, the nipple is perfect.<br />Have ordered and reordered so many times. Now just wish they wouldn't go missing all the time!"
fantastic..a bit too big for ny 2mo old but great none the less
"My son will take most any type of pacifier if he is wanting it bad enough, but these MAM Air pacis are his absolute favorite. They even stay in his mouth when he's asleep which keeps me from having to wake up to put it back in since he's not really able to yet."
Our baby loves his WubbaNubs. We have the giraffe and elephant and he loves to cuddle them as the pacifier soothes him to sleep. We also have the regular soothies but found that the WubbaNubs stay in his mouth better. Definitely recommend!
Perfect!  Just as described and exactly what I expected! They will get a ton of use.
Lovely
"These pacifiers SUCK!  Yes, in the best way possible.  They are easy to clean because water does not get trapped in them.  And you can watch baby's little mouth suck on them.  For teethers, this pacifier is great because you can stick your finger in there for a little extra chew!"
"i bought two additional sets, for a total of three sets. these are great for cereal, noodles, anything. portion amount doesn't make me second guess if the kids are eating too much or not enough. the ones that came to me are the pink and green flower and butterfly designs, both sets."
so cute.  arrived on time.  very well made.  long enough for my child.  she is 4 but 45&#34; tall and i wanted something that she could stretch out on. she uses it for her prek class.  easy to carry with strap.  had it monogrammed.  she really likes it and so do i.
"works well with our baby.  we haven't had occasion to fold it up yet, but i'll be glad to have that feature if we need to store it away.  it's fabric is detachable and washable and the tray liner comes off for cleaning.  the tray is fairly easy to adjust back and forth.  we haven't had any issues and have enjoyed using this highchair."
makes pumping at work and home so easy! i can't relax enough to &#34;let-down&#34; if i am holding onto the pump parts. so this fixed that problem. highly recommend for any working or pumping mama!
"pillow is amazing, my wife sleeps like a charm with this i would recommend it to every pregnant woman out there for a very comfortable rest and more"
"i used a bath tub ring for my children when they were small and i loved it. they are 29 and 31 now. my granddaughter just turned one and that's why i ordered the bath tub ring. as long as you are attentive and never leave the child alone for a second, there is no problem. after all, i used it for my adult children and there wasn't a problem."
"i like this toothbrush because it's safe, gets the job done, doesn't pose a danger to the child, and starts to teach the routine of brushing your teeth before bed and in the morning."
"i don't like a lot of baby gear and i definitely wouldn't consider this a &#34;mom necessity&#34; by any means, but it's a nice bonus. stays shut very well. allows me to not have to carry around a monster-sized package of wipes for a quick little outing with the baby. slim and durable. it's also nice to go to in the middle of the night and not have to hear that awful crinkly sound of the plastic packaging that wipes come in. plus, it's cute... i have the anchor one."
this are the best!
bought one for my grandson and later several more as gifts.
"if you are looking for a good chew toy for a baby, this is it! she is now 13 months and she is still using it."
"we bought this to help us get through a summer of traveling and an international move. i feel like it gave our two year old some extra security, to have the same bed every night, no matter where we were. it definitely has a fort vibe, and she thought it was very cool.<br />she did figure out how to unzip it in about five minutes, so if like us you have a kid who won't sleep if they can get free, you might want to factor that in to your purchase decision. she did get used to having to go to sleep once in it though.<br />it is very durable, and easy to rinse out, with a quick drying time. i definitely recommend this!"
"this was a great buy!  i have been using this high chair for a year now and it's been sturdy, easy to use and most importantly easy to clean.  i just take the pad & straps off & throw in my washing machine.  the tray is easy to clean and hasn't gotten stained by sweet potatoes & marinara sauce like other trays i've had.  my daughter started using this at 7 months old and she fit just fine.  she's 19 months now and it's still not too tight on her.  i'm about ready to use it as a booster seat now so i love that it has dual functions as a high chair & a booster!"
"this sleep sack is great! keeps my baby warm without having to use a blanket that could get all twisted up. my daughter ended up with her feet inside the sack 1/2 the time, defeating the purpose of the leg holes, but i guess that's how she liked it! great product!"
excellent.  product as described.  fast delivery.
"wonderful seat! it's so comfortable and sturdy, and we can tell already it'll be safe and last many years."
worked great. our car seat fit nicely and seemed well protected.
adorable!!
good!
this is the second one i buy because my twins love it so much that they kinda fight over it!
loved it. the best way to shop is amazon.
"great product, and price!"
"my grandson is autistic and he is 6 years old. he loves these numbers and letters especially the numbers; he will hold a set of numbers up and say 25, or 82, etc...  i'm sure you may have been expecting possibly a review on a toddler or pre-k child. just know that these work well in the tub (although he likes to carry them when he gets out), the colors of course aide in the visual part.  they do exactly what they should; they help teach him. and heh they out a smile on his sweet face.:)<br />thanks so very much!"
very good with graco gear
fantastic. functional..
absolutely beautiful!  my new grandson gets to sleep in style and he is at just the right height for me to get to him!
nice product. it is so easy to use it with our newborn..
"where was this product when my kids were little?  i purchased this for my grandson.  it fits the crib well, you can attach toys to it, and it saves the crib from teething damage.  it is a medium weight fabric.  perfect for my uses."
"for all moms who suffer with this type of problem, i understand that any experience to alleviate the pain of our little ones to be valid.<br />amber is a traditional and natural remedy used in europe for centuries, prized for its anti-inflammatory, healing and immune-stimulating analgesic properties.<br />today, the amber necklace is used worldwide to relieve the symptoms associated with baby's teething pain, fever, swelling of the gums, red cheeks, ear infections, rashes, sleep problems and restlessness.<br />besides of teething, the amber necklace can have a positive effect on allergies, eczema, rashes, cramps, respiratory diseases and improves sleep and immunity.<br />i was a bit concerned with the beads, but the use of amber necklace should be done under adult supervision, as the baby should never be alone when wearing it. try to wear on the ankle with a sock covering it, so it could be a lot safer.<br />with basic precautions, you will achieve more success with the amber necklace too. remember that we are talking about our baby and even with this little help from mother nature, it is important to keep safety first!"
we both bottle feed and breastfeed my son. he transitions easily with this bottle. we use the slow flow nipples and are very happy with them.
"love sophie and that she isn't made with sketchy chemicals. i do wish my kid was more interested in her right now, but at 6 months she still gravitates towards things with louder primary colors that have attachments that fit in her tiny mouth a bit better. assuming as she gets a bit older and more confident in her grasp sophie will become a favorite."
these are wonderful. no more taking whole car seat apart when they have an accident.
Very good and does the job!
Have not tried very many pacifiers but my baby seems to really like this one. The covers that come with each pacifier is very nice. Colors are nice.
This is cuter than it looks online and my nephew -- a newborn -- has already figured out how to put it in his mouth. I love these & I plan to give them as baby shower gifts.
Hilarious! My nephew is not here yet but I am even more excited to see him now that I have this pacifier for him. As for size and fit of the pacifier...I cannot help. I have NO clue what I am doing in that area. But for the money it is worth a good laugh. Enjoy
Pretty! Exclusive!
Only pacifier my baby will take. Love them!
Many of the pacifiers are too bulky even if they say &#34;newborn&#34;.  These work well for my newborn grandson.
absolutely love this!! made putting my daughter in her own room a lot easier on mom!
have been using in our baby's nursery about 2 months now! works great and very accurate readings! the best feature is the color changing so we can see if the temperature is in right range from a quick glance when passing nursery. very happy with purchase knowing we can always have baby's nursery at safe temperature!
awesome!
great seat for my 4yr old!
"perfect.  my twin sons have slept 10-11 hrs a night since week 10 and i largely attribute it to the halo sleepsack.  although the larger sized do not swaddle, my boys prefer the sleeveless option anyway."
exactly what i have been looking for in a bath mat.  i arrived in a timely manner and products was just as described.  i like that it is clear which makes for better cleaning and it is superior to the quality of any other bath mat i have ever bought.  this product exceeded my expectations and i could not be happier.
my grandson is 1 year old and still loves to sit in it.
perfect for when my grandchildren visit - easy to move from room to room
real cute.
beautiful swing!  i love all the features.
this is kind of a flimsy plastic and we could only use 2of the 12 or so pre-drilled holes. but works perfect. not for our dog per se'  it's for our turtle.. it took one look at it and turned and walked away.  well worth the price.
easy to use & cute!
"great quality product, solid and very stable/sturdy. it did take me a bit to set it up, i would definitely recommend getting a level to make sure it is straight, otherwise you might have trouble with it closing/opening such as i did. i made some adjustments and it works great now. i actually bought it as a dog gate, not for kids, but it works great and looks great, like i said very stable and it feels like it would hold up really good against quite a bit of force. my concern when i purchased it was if it would hold up to getting pushed, my dog likes to push things open and he is very strong but i have no concern with this after installing it, holds up very well  it comes with sets of screws, long ones and short ones, depending on the type of wall you are mounting it on. also it comes with two strips of paper that has an image of the mounting pieces, to help you with lining it up on the wall and drilling/screwing the holes in the right place. also, it is adjustable with three different lengths when attaching the 2 pieces of the gate together as well as the ends of the gate has pretty long screws that you can adjust as well.  i would most definitely purchase this product again if i needed to and i would recommend it to anyone. great quality product."
works great!  easy to travel with our baby.  infinitely adjustable to anyone in the family!!  we got grey and the color is exactly like the picture.  very happy with this purchase.
never asked the baby if he likes it because his two weeks old. but mom does .
you must get one!! i prefer the silicone instead of the mesh way easier to clean and it's a great teether!
"this was an amazing raincoat for the price. i bought this one for my 3 year old son and a ladybug one for my 4 year old daughter. they did fit a little big, but i thought it was really nice the way they hung well below the knee for added protection in the rain. the quality is good, and after using them repeatedly, i can see them lasting for years to come. i also bought the matching rain boots and umbrellas and both of my kids were very exited to wear them. in the spring when it's raining every day, it's so nice to see them excited to get dressed up and go outside."
"these are great because they hold a substantial amount of juice for baby, are easy to disasymble for easy cleaning, and have replaceable parts for sale (the leak-proof attachment). i have tried about 15 different kinds of sippy cups for my twin 23 mo olds and these seem to be the only ones that barely leak. i've learned that if a true &#34;leak proof&#34; cup exists, it's not sold in tx or online because i've purchased them all!  these come extremely close to being totally leak-proof though."
"Nice soothies, great for breastfeeding babies, my daughter has no problem taking these."
Love the Mam pacifiers!
"Kid loves them, great packaging, not much else to ask for."
"My 1yr old is crazy about this. She has this and a lamb.  I want to take her off but for now its great. It washes easy with other cloths. It dry's good (air dry or dryer) Its my 1yr olds Best Fiend, so it its still looking good after her day with it I say its a good product."
"Everything is very good, I like very much, hope children can also like!"
"I will not use any other pacifier for my baby! Not only does it help with breast feeding babies, but it is reassuring to know how safely the product is made - and the components of the pacifier. Will be ordering more! :)"
This is awesome and helps sooth my baby.. helps it go to sleep. I like that the pacifier is similar to the one that the hospital gives us.
Good Pacifier.The product is worth the money.
Best pacifier! My daughter loves to play with the giraffe now that she is older (5 months) and likes to nibble at the edge of the pacifier. The stuffed animal does help the pacifier stay in and makes it easier for her to grab.
turned out cute
"After trying SEVERAL different (much cuter) pacifiers, we have stock piled these for our baby girl. They are the ONLY pacifiers she'll use and they have been lifesavers on many occasions!"
Cute
I love these. If you have ever been down of your hands and knees trying to find a lost pacifier than you will appreciate these.<br /><br /> I was a little nervous when some reviewers mentioned how bright they are. I have wondered that myself but try don't seem to bother my baby. And one thing that helps is I only use these at night and keep them away from bright light during the day and then they don't glow very dark at night. Just enough so that you can find them!
good
avent makes great products my son loves these!
"Great product my son loves them. he has the tiger, Dragon, owl, and frog."
"carter's purple floral printed crib sheet:  colours are as pictured (i love how the different shades of purple coordinate with different purples in our nursery), fit is great even with a mattress protector under it, washes and drys great, soft and doesn't get nubby after washing. great quality; highly recommend!"
"baby really likes these. he sucks/chews on the pacifier but also on the hard plastic part when teething. as advertised, the pacifier does close when it hits the floor. once it closes, however, baby can't get it open on his own. if your baby likes to play the game of throwing things down, it will close and you will have to open it again for him. the different faces are cute. we have the clown and the penguin."
great car seat... i love it. my son is safe while in the car and it is really comfortable for him...
"here's something i should have bought the day my son was born.  these are great and protect your seat backs from scuffs, mud, salt, snow etc.  there are even a few pouches on the top for him to store stuff in.  fit great on a toyota fj and benz glk350."
"after several blowouts with my one month old, i purchased this for my britax b safe carseat. it fits perfectly fine and saves tons of time on accidents"
perfect for a sandwich and some snacks!  easy to open velcro for little fingers.  easy to wash (just flip it inside/out).
perfect little snack bags!
i really like these pouches. they stand up well and hold quite a bit. at first i wasn't sure how the spout on the side would work but its actually easier for my one year old to do on his own. i also love that they are dishwasher safe!!!
"i own a drywall company and this product does exactly what it says it will do. i've used it for several years. yes, it's pricey but the end result is worth it. just a tip-cut/bed the edges once it's in place and has dried in. it is not necessary to fill the actual crease, just the edges. i adjust my price a bit when using this on jobs with vaulted ceilings."
My son will only use Mam pacifiers - we love them!
"My son will only use MAM pacifiers - love these glow in the dark ones.  If he cries in the middle of the night and wants his pacifier, the glow helps them to be easily found in his crib in the dark - my favorite for sure!"
So cute!!!!!  Baby's love these wubbanubs
"This is probably the 3rd or 4th review I've ever given on Amazon, but I felt it deserved one. I got this for my son when he was born in 2012. It has held up well through washes and binkys are easily changed. My son LOVES this thing. He is now two and carries it around everyday and sleeps with it at night. If we ever lost &#34;bb bear&#34; as we call him, it would be the end of the world for him. Let's hope that never happens."
Love it!
Best price i have seen so far.. ofcourse it is worth the money and best price ever..
Great pacifiers!
nice ambient light. very sophisticated. not the brightest night light but i only wanted something with a little glow. plenty to light the bathroom enough so you don't have to turn the lights on at night. also really durable and easy to pack and take with us on vacation. just toss it in your bag.
you never have enough hooded towels for baby either after bath or later on the beach.  gerber has always made a quality product at a reasonable price.
great teether for molars. my son really likes it and it is saving his poor fingers! reaches both sides of his mouth.
so cute and works very well.
"we just bought this pillow for my 2.5 year old as she transitioned to her big girl bed!  she was super excited about this but the big people pillows were just not cutting it!  they were way too tall and firm for her little neck.  i searched and found this great option and we were not disappointed!  the pillow is fluffy, but not too firm.  she loves to rest her head on it and it makes her feel even more like a big girl!  couldn't be happier with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat!"
"this organizer was a lifesaver on a recent road trip! i was driving cross country alone with my daughter, so i needed something to keep her &#34;stuff&#34; organized and easy to reach. i won't travel without it!"
"i love...love...love my wall decal.  it arrived earlier than expected, was super easy to apply and looks beautiful"
"i purchased this when my baby was a newborn. she wanted to be held all the time and the only way i was able to get anything done was to put her in it. you still need to support their head, but it at least gives you one free hand and a rest for your arms. i now take my baby for walks in the carrier almost every day. she usually falls asleep right in it by the time we get home. i have not figured out a safe or comfortable way to nurse in this carrier yet. i think this is a good carrier for the price and would absolutely recommend it to friends. i find this much easier to use than the moby, and it is more affordable too. i love the color, it is exactly as pictured."
we bought this for my granddaughters 6th birthday.  she was thrilled with it and couldn't wait to get it home to her own room.  it was very well packaged with each piece of wood individually wrapped in packing paper so as not to get scratched.  it was quite easy to put together and is perfect for her.  i highly recommend this product.
perfect
these are magical
what's better than muslin in the summertime?  it breathes and is comfortable for your little one.
great baby safe toy for my son to sleep with!!
love it
"my kids love this brush, and i have piece of mind that they won't choke on it with the handles."
"absolutely love this thing. recommend for any parent having issues with getting newborns to sleep. the only issue is ours has this &#34;creaking&#34; sound when its being rocked back and forth but for all the hours of sleep this thing won my wife and i, i cannot say anything bad about it."
"my 10 month old loves to chew on this a little. she only had 6 teeth so far so we don't so too much with it yet, just getting her used to it. it's soft and she likes the feeling of the bristles."
Love it!
Awesome! Works great!
Love the 100% silicon and orthopedic nipple.
"Switched from the Soothies to these, with better results. My middle son loved the Soothies until he was about 6 months old, but my youngest kept spitting them out as newborn. They were too heavy for him. We switched to the lighter Freeflow pacis and they work great for him. Sometimes with pacifiers you have to keep trying until you find one baby likes."
Awesome for my paci addicted daughter!
Excellent!
It keeps the pacifier in with a &#34;light&#34; amount of pressure.  Everyone sleeps better.  You can easily tuck it into the swaddle as well.  Highly recommend!
"Best deal I've found out there for binkies. Especially since we usually lose one or two a day, its nice to have back ups."
A great concept!! Baby can hold onto the pacifier well with the cute monkey attached.
Just what I expected.  Great.
Great
Perfect size for my baby it's the only pacifier my baby will use and I got it at a wonderful price I'm extremely happy with  my purchase.
soft and easy to install!
this works perfectly!
glider arrived with the back broken. contacted stork craft and they quickly sent out a replacement. everything said and done glider put together it's nice and smooth.<br /><br />most important to me is customer service.. storkcraft did a fantastic job at that.
"i bought this for my new grandson, but his three-and-a-half-year-old sister loves the music and has taken it over as her own. she'll share it with him later!"
nothing special works like any other...not as fluffy as my original one...very stiff.
"i got this when we first started using the potty on a regular basis because my daughter was still a little scared of the &#34;big potty&#34;. it is great because it easily fits in a diaper bag and is easy to take on the go. it saved the day on a trip to the park this spring when the bathroom facilities were not open yet and we had a &#34;i have to go now!&#34; moment - i set this up using one of bags that was included and was able to just remove it once she was done, tie it up and throw it away - accident avoided!<br />as other reviewers have mentioned, you can use plastic grocery sacks lined with an absorbent paper towel or something similar so i wouldn't recommend buying the special bags."
love these things. they have been a lifesaver. these are so sturdy and aft enough for our kiddo's patootie. they easily contain solids and are flush able so we don't have to use the diaper sprayer that much which is a horrible activity. they also don't bunch up in the diaper like most other liners we've tried and i believe it's due to it's sturdiness.
"this thing is pretty awesome. we live in texas and since my little guy is still in a rear facing carseat, he was melting this summer. someone suggested the noggle and it has been a life saver. i can easily adjust it depending on the day and can easily swap it out between my husband's truck and my car. it's a great buy."
Very nice! Good quality! I think my twin granddaughters will get plenty of use out of these!
I bought this for my niece when she was born.  She loves it!  She had to be under the light while in the hospital.  My sister couldn't hold her and the baby wanted physical touch.  She would cry if someone wasn't touching her.  When we gave her this she quieted immediately.  She loved the way it felt on her tummy.  Now she is 8 months old and still this is her go-to binki!  And it's so cute!
"great quality, modern design"
i love this. it is a life saver. it helps to calm out daughter down every time. it never failed. i heard about the technique but when i realized there was a device i was sold.
soft and versatile
so soft and cute. perfect baby shower gift. great price and fast shipping.
cute design and images!  very sturdy as well!
very cute for my grand daughters nursery
very good
"these are fantastic and very affordable. we used the newborn size for the first 1-2 months, then the infant size. we first used them traditionally with snappis and covers and now we still use the infant size to stuff our pocket diapers. very absorbent and work great both ways."
greate product! i am using it for my nipple shields and it really cleans them perfectly. reccommend.
"these were lifesavers in the first couple of weeks of breastfeeding. i wish i'd known about them when i had my first child. they are cool and soothing, while protecting cracked nipples from chafing against the inside of your bra or shirt."
more than i expected for the price! wish too buy more like this!
"the stand up potty is a bit short. however, we set it on a small step stool (a kids plastic one) and it is the perfect for height for our son. just make sure that the step stool and back side of the potty are next to a wall or cabinet so it won't fall backwards. rinses easy. i wipe it down with toilet paper after he uses it so it stays clean."
soft little sheets for a port crib. perfect for little visitors.
they really do keep the sun out without obstructing your view
great little kick mat for the price. we bought a tummy time mat as well. the price for both was still cheaper than a dual purpose mat. the tummy time also fits folded up inside of this mat when it is zipped up.
"great for traveling, dining out ....fits almost everywhere even well made plastic tables. comes with a nice travel bag and set/breakdown is easy.....if we had this first, we would not need a high chair"
good product!
perfect for transferring a sleeping baby from the car to a swing. and it's compact size is great for small places and travelling.
"this is soooo  nice!  its a quilt,  don't understand why they call it a coverlet?? its perfect for a mini crib!"
it is a good product.  very useful.
Fits our dream baby gate! Very happy with the whole product!
"I have a 7-week old baby that loves to suck and soothe with the a pacifier. We have an assortment at our house in a variety of brands and styles.  I really like these pacifiers.  It fits in her mouth perfect and of all the pacifier types we have she does seem to prefer this style the best.  She will take any of the pacifiers, but she has less trouble immediately sucking on the phillips agent ones than the more standard pacifiers.  We bought the yellow ones, since we didn't know the sex of our baby prior to arrival and they are great.  They are easy to spot when she loses them in her car seat or swing.  Also, it is kind of funny to watch her suck it since you can see through the bottom.  Other moms have told me their babies have gotten their thumb stuck in the bottom, but that has yet to happen to us and I don't anticipate any issues.  I would definitely buy this product again."
"I purchased the Natursutten BPA free Natural Rubber Pacifier because it is all rubber, BPA free & thought it would make a great chew-toy for my great-grandson. He does not use a pacifier of any kind, but loves to chew rubbery items. He loves it! :)"
"very soothing, does not build up gas, love it!"
Love them
So cute.
"Nice pacifier holder.  Very sturdy material.  My daughter never cared for pacifiers or I would have used it more... but for the time that it was used, I thought it was great."
"No gas, no fuss. Just be sure the bottoms are in all the way to avoid spills!"
All perfect!
My baby niece loved it when she used it
Great
"The girls loved it, and had fun with it."
love it
Great
"great calendar to record your babies first year. i received a different one for my first child as a gift and loved it, so i wanted to find another one for my second child.  i came across this one that is very similar to the other.  it has cute little designs and graphics to make it eye-catching and has everything you need to record all of you baby's firsts.  so cute!"
we purchased this warmer when my son was born 4 years ago and are now using it for my daughter. we've been very pleased with this warmer.
"it came folded up, and i would've preferred it rolled up in a tube to avoid creases, but it still stuck on the wall very well and looks great!"
good deal and great price!
this was such a great present to give. i love whenever i go over and see it's still displayed in the nursery! :)
"a must have for every new parent, the best on the market. love it!"
"i'm shocked how many granola mommies told me to get a wipe warmer. i would have thought of all gimmicky products this was one you could do without. but, it has been a nice experience for my newborn. and, from what i understand as they get older a warm wipe especially at night time changing is a must to keep a fussy baby from reacting to a cold wipe.<br /><br />i use my own homemade cloth wipes rolled up. for the recipe i add 4cups water, 1 tsp. vitamin e oil, 1 tsp. castille soap, 10 drops lavender essential oil with 50 homemade 7&#34;x7&#34; cotton flannel squares."
this product is great! when we were first looking the one that matched our stroller was 50$ considering we had already spend $450 we didn't want to spend another 50. i saw this and with the adjustable straps and knew it would work. my husband and i also jog and nothing moves in it. awesome product.
"love love love this baby carrier!! i did a ton of research and ended up buying this carrier (after other buys that i was not pleased with) and i am so happy with the final decision on this one. it fits both my husband and i comfortably, it is so easy to take on and of, and it is lightweight enough to bring any where.  and most importantly, my twin boys like it!!! the base is wide enough to support their butts which is better for their hips and they fit inside completely as they are still infant sized. i will be excited when they are bigger and we can use it in more positions! over all i love my bitty bean!"
headband looked exactly how its pictured.  perfect for my daughters baptism!
"worked great for a long drive for my 12 month old.  size is perfect.  both sides work well, i did not think that the non fuzzy side was too scratchy.  i will continue to use it for our commute to daycare."
very useful.
"works to fit about 4 big bottles, and a  bunch of accessories. we typically sterilize all our pacifiers and dr.brown's bottles once a day and we have to run this through twice. cost effective instead of using the bags."
"i love these bibs, easy to clean, easy to put on and off.  the price is good.  they are perfect."
it does what it's supposed to. soft to the touch - proper fit - this cover is our primary now.
"surprisingly sturdy.  from the looks of the picture this bed looks like it will fall to pieces when an adult sits on it, but it's pretty sturdy.  was very easy to put together (much easier with two people)."
my child is 9 and loves this seat belt adjuster.  keeps the seat belt off her neck and helps her feel secure!
"it was worth spending a little extra. this bouncer is awesome. my only complaint is that there's a kind of sharp edge underneath where my son hits his knees sometimes. it just irritates, it doesn't cut or anything. easily fixed with some good old fashioned child proofing."
"i love this monitor. the only thing i would add is recording capability. the picture is clear, even in total darkness. the microphone is almost too good.. literally. it has lots of features, and we never have to deal with interference. highly recommended."
another soft cute book for my little grandson. cute little creatures throughout.
works just like the more expensive products. love it
i love the stroller is very light for ride my husband call it the mercedes benz of the strollers
love these sheets.  the big selling point is that the flat sheet has a small fitted seat section at the bottom of the sheet.  it really helps it stay on when those tossing toddlers are fighting bed time.
"i bought the britax roundabout for my 1 year old grandson. his father and mother were very impressed with the fit and safety rating. so impressed they ordered one, for one of their automobiles. grandson rides comfortable and happy.<br />thanks britax"
was perfect! beautiful
so happy about the glass option for avent bottles! we have been lucky not to drop one yet so i'm not sure if it will break easily but it seems pretty sturdy! wish it was easier to get a silicone sleeve.
"i love it! and easy and secure way to carry baby facing front, it carries in other ways too, but i got it specifically for my baby to be facing out"
"i wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered this amber necklace, but it had great reviews and i thought i might as well give it a try.  i would much rather give my little girl some beautiful to wear than to pump her full of pain medication.  my daughter had been suffering terrible teething pains and all i know is she is doing a million times better now.  she adores the necklace.  i had her in my lap when i opened the package and right away she was drawn to it.  this does mean that the directions need to be followed and i absolutely never leave her alone with the necklace.  however, her whole demeanor has changed.  no more long crying jags.  i put the necklace on her and we sit with a small hand held mirror i have and i tease her, &#34;is that your necklace?  is that your necklace?&#34; and she just laughs and laughs.  so whether it's the amber, or the entertainment, i simply don't care.  i'm just so pleased to have a happy little girl again."
used this at my doctors office and fell in love! came home and ordered one right away! boppy pillow went in the trash as soon as this came!!
quick delivery. item just as stated.
"my daughter loves this tub.  it's easy to use, easy to clean, and allows my daughter to sit at such an angle on the little ledge that she can kick her legs and splash.  she has a ball!  also love the little toy that comes with it."
Love it. So cute.
"My 3 month old loves his wubbanubs, he snuggles it when he's sleeping and holds it when he's awake!this is the second one we bought, the giraffe is upper cute too. I would recommend it to everyone!"
ty so much what a deal!
The most adorable way to carry an extra pacifier or two!
My daughter LOVED these!!
Can't get enough Wubbanubs.  Ultra cute.  Ultra useful.
Cute
Great for younger infants to keep pacifier within reach. Love it
"Great price, baby  really enjoys these ones"
"These are the kind the hospital nursey uses, and I loved the girlie colors"
Cute as a button....just like my first grandchild!
Great !
so cute
"baby likes it.<br />I like it too because it comes with a cover to keep it clean,"
"I've ordered MAM pacifiers several times and have always been happy with the product. I ordered more because our pediatrician recommended keeping several in the crib so that he could find one himself in the middle of the night, instead of waking us at 4:00 am to find it. I ordered the Glow in the Dark nighttime and Air Silicone versions. I especially like these because he can wrap his little fingers around the edges without too much accuracy and can also attach easily to a pacifier clip should we (on occasion) need to take them on the go. I would also like to note that the design received was the same as that shown in the picture (a blue zig-zag design and lighter stars graphic)."
Love this little thing!
"works great as a security camera. it's flexible because you can position it anywhere. you can rotate the camera horizontally as well as vertically. low light vision is reasonably good, so is the sound. transmission and reception is great. you'll love this gadget. it is well built just like any motorola device is."
i was skeptical at first on buying this. my daughter hates belt. i went on another website and they had there dapper snapper for $34. i was able to get this for $10 and i have to say that i am not disappointed at all. i will definitely recommend this product to others.  who ever came up with this idea hats off to you. thank you...
"i've had this monitor for 16 months, and the monitor itself just broke...by broke i mean the charger port sheered off inside the device itself so there is no way i can charge it even if i wanted to.  called motorola, who has a line specifically for baby monitor issues (1-888-331-3383), and within 15 mins, they are shipping me out a replacement unit for free!  that's what i call great customer service!  this is our 2nd monitor system (the 1st was not motorola and we had countless issues with it).  these things...they just break.  i have been expecting it.  so when it did finally happen, i was expecting a long, drawn out and expensive process.  what i got was the opposite.  thanks, motorola, for some awesome customer service!"
my daughter love this!
"works great, keeps odor out, and easy to change."
love it! so adorable on my baby girl!
sofie is one of the best teethers ever! my grandson loves it! it's a great gift for a baby shower or just a gift for what ever. this is the 4th one that i have bought and will continue buying them! they are a hit for teething babies!!
perfect
much better than the suction based ones. also safer that the retractable ones and more stable than regular ones.<br />quite good for money.
"worked great, i just wish that i'd ordered them sooner.  it's really helpful that you get 3 sizes in the pack.  at different times, i would use all three sizes.  much more comfortable than the standard shields that came with my medela pump."
our twin's favorite &#34;loveys.&#34; these are by far one of the best purchases for our boys. they sleep with these little guys and snuggle them as soon as they get in their crib. they also like to suck and teethe on the trunk. we were happy to see the fabric is breathable (and soft) as our little guys like to put them over their face. another perk is that they are washable and come out even softer than they were. the perfect first little companion for any baby!<br /><br />we've since given these as baby gifts and will continue to do so.
my son loves this thing. its got a hard plastic corner that is great for those teeth that are coming in.
amazing product! amazing service!
"just perfect for the little one with itching gums.  i was worried that the head would be too large to fit into baby's mouth.  but while the entire head doesn't fit, the ears do!  just the right size for a 6 month old hands."
"these are probably my longest running sippy cups. they do not leak. they have an attached lid to cover the mouth piece which is great for travel. cute designs, easy to clean."
"very easy. works great. looks good. they should have more colors, like black."
"we absolutely love this stroller! it took me 5 minutes to put it together. it's really used friendly, doesn't take up a lot of room and it rides smoothly! a friend encouraged me to get it and i'm so glad she did!"
i just received this and it's precious! i don't know what i'm having yet and wanted an affordable option to bring baby home with if i have a girl. this fits my needs perfectly
The glow in the dark is so helpful for nighttime lost paci in crib crisis ;) gender neutral too
"Absolutely amazing!!! My baby girl loves hers so much!! It's so cute to watch her cuddle and wrestle with it. Also, it's very easy to keep track of!! If you buy this you should buy two so you have a backup when you wash the first one. My daughter hates being without hers."
Good quality product.
Everything was perfect
this is the greatest invention.  ever.  as a new mom the idea of taking my baby's temperature the &#34;old fashioned&#34; way completely freaked me out but I never feel like the under the arm method is as accurate as it should be.  then this came along and I can't imagine not having it.  we have already used it and it's perfect! I ordered two so that my sister-in-law and mommy-to-be never has to worry!!
cute and good value. gift for grandson
Super
"My daughter loves these, she won't use anything but this brand. They are very durable and don't have much scent to them either."
ONLY ONES MY GRAND SON USES
"Super Cute Pacifier for Baby Girl 6 Months+!  These are just adorable and I consider them fashionable.  My baby girl enjoys these pacifiers, they're easy to breathe through!"
"Big one is for wet swimsuit or water shoes (I ordered a couple of bags in this size), small one is just right for Diva Cup. They are nice and cheery in my bag! Far more pleasant than a Ziploc bag."
"My son has reflux, and he loves his wubanub. We call him coco the monkey, and when he has coco, he squeezes him and never looses his pacifier. It's great. :)"
These pacifiers are awesome. Kids love them.
My baby is a big fan of MAM pacifiers! And I love that they glow in the dark because I find them easily in the night!
awesome at night to find quickly without lights
We love the Nuk pacifiers. This pack was the best deal that I could find at the time.
Excellent seller and products and very nice
perfect!
i love these bottles! but never sterilize in a sterilizer that you don't know is safe or not safe for the bottles. mine warped. 
"cute design, functional, serves its purpose. my husband did have to zip tie it to the faucet so it wouldn't fall off, but other than that no issues."
"installs easy - yes, there is a seemingly large gap until you tighten it up but once you get one set can get others arranged quickly.  easy to set up multiple gates around the house and create pet friendly zones."
these were wonderful for our trip to disney...  i will definitely be buying these again!
great griip but tough to get in and out of diaper bag if tight fitting.
i love this thing; it's so cool how it turns on as soon as it touches water! i think my baby will love it too once he's old enough to enjoy baths and play with toys. the only downside is that it remains lit up if not properly dried off and i worry that the batteries will die quickly.
love this carrier. after doing it a time or two it is really easy to figure out. i really like that there isn't a lot of extra fabric and it holds baby nice and close. i would definitely recommend this to a friend.
"they're awesome. i wish i had bought them earlier. i do wish they came in a slightly smaller size, meaning the actual surface size. i have a huge 7 month year old and it sort of overwhelms him. also a white bib? why? it stayed white for 2 seconds and now looks disgusting."
"works great and keeps our youngest out of the kitchen. we have an apartment where the kitchen is rather open, which meant that the kitchen has a rather wide entrance. this gate has kept them out where others have not, and also isn't susceptible to our youngest aspiring rock climber. great buy, definitely use the wall mounts."
great
i love it!
great-grandaughter already has a horse like this. it is her favorite. we almost lost &#34;horsie&#34;. now we have a friend in case that tragedy happens.
"very cute blankets and great for swaddling in warm weather. our baby won't sleep unless he is swaddled but the weather has been so hot that our house gets to 80 degrees even with the air conditioner on!  with these blankets we can still swaddle him when it's warm and he can sleep well without us worrying about him overheating.  they are nice and big too, much better for swaddling than all of our other blankets.  my only complaint is that they are pretty expensive for basically big pieces of muslin fabric but we have definitely gotten our moneys worth this summer."
excellent seller and products and very nice
was easy to hang and really made the room.
"love them, use them for everything. as a thrifty person these are actually worth the money!"
this is your typical baby book. it's decent quality for the cheap price.
this addition is awesome.  it makes the joovy stroller for two into a real two seater.  my 4 year old son absolutely loves that he can now recline like his sister!  great product!    i forgot to add that installation is also super easy.  its just a bunch of clicks with snaps and you have the seat!
"great waterproof mattress that we placed right on top of the mini-crib mattress. the crib sheets fit nice and snug over both mattresses, and will protect the actual crib mattress during it's use."
"works great! easy to install and keeps our baby out, but our older toddler is able to open and close it on his own. when we bought this we had forgotten that our older toddler actually would need to be able to open it since he's potty trained. well no problem, he was able to learn it in 10 minutes. well worth the money to keep our baby's curious hands out of the dang toilet water!"
i love this stroller it's very user friendly and light weight which is good for me since i can't lift anything heavy. i love it.
"this is a nice sheet because it has enough &#34;give&#34; to the fabric to stretch over mattress corners and make it easy to make up the crib, but not so much stretch that it gets baggy or wrinkled--it has a good smooth fit. it's a nice soft cotton too."
this has been the best pump i have owned. it is easy to clean and easy to use. love it.
"we love this high chair, very well made and easy to use."
good enough
"my daughter loves this. also, every kid that she plays with, including older kids, love this. its the cutest toy ever. the yellow section plays music and the little apple has a squeeker in it."
this thermometer is perfect for when you need to take a temperature and you have a squirmy baby/child.  i like how it is fast and extremely easy to use. i work at a preschool and we use this thermometer several times a day.
my daughter loves this backpack! we were so happy with it we ordered the same one for her cousin. it's the perfect size for 2-5 year olds.
"solid and well made.  the assembly process takes a little while, but that's actually a good thing because the parts are really well attached to each other with fasteners in multiple places.  having 4 heights at which the mattress can be positioned is very helpful."
"every stage is perfect, my baby still uses the pieces"
"not much to say, other than it serves the purpose for what it's intended.  my child doesn't mind using it and was pretty excited when it arrived!  it cleans easily and doesn't clash with the other bathroom decor.  overall, it was a great price and my kid is happy with it, so i can't ask for much more than that."
it's awesome. .buy it.... the kid will love it!
adorable!  so many thank you's on my thank you notes.
"love this stroller, it makes life so much easier! i had the chicco lightweight with my son and decided to buy the plus so would fit my daughters car seat! it is so easy to use and isn't huge! best stroller ever! chicco never disappoints!"
Love my wubbanub. Could not live without them
She WUBS WUBS WUBS her sweet little lamb!  Great Paci for baby!
The best bridal shower gift...ever!
"We never lose this binkie! Ours doesnt look like this anymore because my daughter loves it. She has to have it every night to go to sleep. You would think this would get gross. It does. It got really gross and I kept washing it with a cloth until I got sick of it. Then we threw it in with her bedding. It got washed and dried on medium heat. It was nice and clean and had no issues! It is not recommended but believe me, it needs to be really washed after awhile. We have the elephant."
What an ingenious idea! My 4 month old has been loving them from birth. I highly reccomend them!
"Orthodontic, cute, BPA free pacifiers. Made in Germany."
I loved the idea. I gave it to my sister as a gift for her baby shower with a little remedies set ( no one ever thinks about when babies get sick they only ever buy clothes for baby shower). Its a something different but may still be useful. We will see when the baby comes how well she likes. I'll make an update at that time.
Baby loved this!
My 4 month old daughter loves these. I think they are easier for her to keep in her mouth than the soothes.
Oh the ever so popular wubbanub.  Everyone needs one!
This is such a cute desing.  My baby boy loves this pacifier and used it since he was born.  It was the first object that he started grabing and keept him busy in the car seat.
Love that these are all natural rubber and in one solid piece to prevent germ growth in crevasses.
We love our wubba! Baby can hold it. Hard to lose. Monkey is our favorite. This is my go-to baby gift.
Great product! We love it!!
good
"These are adorable,as always got a great deal!"
"great item.  very happy with product, packing and shipping."
Oh the ever so popular wubbanub.  Everyone needs one!
Great deal. My daughter loves these soothies and I like them better than many of the hard backed pacifiers. The holes on them also allow for lanyards which we love using. She constantly swipes it out of her own mouth or sucks on it so hard sometimes that it spits out by recoil. The 8 inch lanyards are clipped to her clothing so that it doesn't hit the ground and I don't have to keep washing Soothies or get a replacement.
Good quality
loved it!!
These are great for babies who have a tendency to spit out their pacifier or let it drop when they open their mouth - but aren't old enough to put it back in. While riding in the car seat it helps keep it in the mouth without having to turn around every five seconds.
Love it
I buy these for all my new moms as gifts. They seem to really love them and they are super cute.
Love it
Love this Pacifier.
Love it
Really cute for the baby raised on the farm.
Great product. Baby loves it! Mother loves it!
Love this wubbanub!
"Wubbanubs are a real hit with my 6 month old.  She loves sleeping with it at night.  A pain to clean, but totally worth it :)  Have a few in rotation..."
Cute!
Love it!
"Wubbanubs saved me from waking up twice a night to help my daughter find her pacifier. Trust me, if you are considering buying this for your child, DO SO RIGHT AWAY! My daughter uses 2 of these at night and I have never had to wake up at night again :).<br />Happy baby = happy mommy"
"If you've had a child in the NICU, this is likely the pacifier they used in the hospital. We were almost duped by the GumDrop pacifier made by 'The First Years' brand but user reviews pointed us in the right direction. Having the same pacifier has eased the transition from hospital to home and our son continues to like this one."
nice
"We live in the Seattle area and our baby was given orange Gumdrop pacifiers in the hospital when she was born. She loved them and had no interest in other pacifiers. I went to Target and Babies R Us looking for more, and thought I would just get the pink/purple package of what looked like the same Gumdrop pacifiers. Upon opening the package, I realized they are not the same! The ones from the store are smoother/shinier. The pacifiers from the hospital have a little more of a rubbery texture to them. My baby knew the difference too, and rejected the store versions. I was so thankful to find they sell the hospital versions on Amazon! We stocked up and baby is now very happy. Great quality product!"
Has a great scent that never fades. I love it and my LO loves it!
Great idea
These are fabulous!
These are just too cute for baby.  Bought a number of them in all kinds of animals and creatures.
Baby takes well to these. Nice design
Excellent. My exclusively breastfed daughter loves these. Mommy loves the purity and safety. I get lots of questions about it and love saying &#34;it's the only one that passed my strict mommy safety standards&#34;. So grateful for these. It doesn't effect her latch at all like some ppl fear.
great
Grandson loves it.  Received it quickly.  Thank you.
"We love our Wubbies! I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more."
Wubbanubs are an absolute must have in my book and the dragon is the best one! Love love love
"Excellent, the best! I love this cute toy with huge eyes! My grandson always with this Wubbanub Owl!  Looks very adorable!!! Thank you!"
Best pacifier ever - my grandson can easily find it at night in his crib if he wakes up. And it's a baby dragon. How much more can you ask for?
glow in the dark night time soothers are the best!
"My baby loves it and can even get it back in his mouth, at night. That means I love it."
These pacifiers are great. And I love the pastel colors.
Just like the ones from our hospital! The only kind my baby likes.
"New Mom loves pacifiers,"
"My son loves his wubbanub, and I love the cheaper price than in stores!"
my daughter decided that she didn't like bottles and refused to eat for daddy until we pulled out the big guns with this bottle set!<br />she was already jamming on the pacifiers so we decided to try the bottles and they changed my husband's experience.<br />these made all the difference. it's a brilliant concept.
This is one of the few pacifiers my son liked.  This makes a great baby shower gift.  Try pairing it with the children's book Mustache Baby.
Perfect!!
Great toys my son loves them
ok
Loved it. My babys favorite bottles
"Great Product, excellent dealer"
Great pacifiers! My baby loves them.
this was exactly what i was looking for. my 3yr old granddaughter has cerebral palsy and cannot walk yet but she does get around great by knee walking. this product not only cushions her knees but also helps to protect against calluses. best product ever!
"i have used this pump during a couple of years for some short trips i have made without my baby, and the pump is still working properly ! great product!"
perfect for baby changing stations!
highly recommend!! love it!  i loved this tub! it was so much easier than filling the bathtub up with water and it worked perfect until she was 2. another thing that i loved - we all know kids tend to poop in the bath - this is a lot easier to dump and refill than draining the bathtub too! great product!!
great product!!!  my niece loves it!!
super soft and does not pill!  our daughter will not sleep on &#34;regular&#34; sheets with out a fight now.  she loves to &#34;pet&#34; the sheets as she is falling asleep.
fits my britax b scene perfectly.  my 3 year old loves to ride this.
all of our sons have had gerd and needed meds. these are great dispensers at a fair price. they have measurement marks on the sides. these come apart into 3 pieces for easy cleaning. these don't leak if screwed on correctly.<br /><br />very good product.
"these stickers really work. very strong smell out of packaging but that's what the stickers are for. used this sticker on 3 separate occasion on my son and myself and have not had any mosquito bites. (actually had a mosquito land on my hand after i had the sticker on for at least 20 mins and it just flew off! haha). best aspect is that you can reuse them as they are provided in a form of ziplock baggie, once finished you can put them back onto the sticker board and place them back into the bag for reuse."
works very well all the formula always comes out of it very easy
My 14 month old twin grandchildren still is like these &#34;soft&#34; pacifiers the best!
"Best pacifier ever, i think is similar to a nipple thats why babies accept it"
perfect for baby :)
Berry good
Great product!!!! My niece loves it!!
Love these! My son loves these pacifiers! Ive never had any issues with them and we have multiple!
Awe is so cute.  The pacifier edges close around the nipple for clean storage. Great product.
Small enough to hang from anywhere but big enough to hold two (I use the Mam pacifiers) I love that's gender neutral and doesn't take space at all.
"We got a few different types/brands and these have been our son's favorite pacifiers by far.  He seems to keep this one in better than others.  The one-piece silicone design is great.  It's super easy to clean, and the silicone shield seems like it would be more comfortable than a hard plastic shield."
"i am very satisfied with my purchase ,the timing was incredibly accurate .i'll buy from them again ."
"if bugaboo had installed these on the initial unit in the first place, we might not have needed to order these."
very cute!
it's very confortable for your baby!!
"had a bit of trouble trying to install it facing backwards & ended up having to have it face forward.  otherwise, great carseat"
nice and soft just right to cuddle!
our 2 month old loves this thing! her favorite sound is the rainforest. she doesn't love the other music yet. she loves following the animals and coos to them. great developmental toy.
extremely nice for the price.
"the maxy moo moo bibs are great! not only do the various color options allow for easy outfit coordination, but they keep my baby's clothes dry from drool and spit-up! i wish i had more!"
purchased for our 2 year old for camping and it is a great quality and works as designed!
"nice product, kept the mattress dry and clean and fits well.  easy to wash and dry.  definitely recommend"
good
works perfectly
"i love how easily the drawers slide, and how much space there is to store the necessary items  one needs for the baby.  it arrived quickly, in good condition, and all the necessary parts were enclosed.  the only frustration was putting it together.  luckily my husband is very good at this sort of thing; however there were almost no instructions on the paper.  construction proved to be time consuming and difficult.  this wasn't the sellers fault.  the product once completed is attractive, and practical."
"i had to redo the prints several times because i wanted them perfect, and that's what i ended up with.<br />the finished product is super cute, i wish i didn't poke a hole in it for the ribbon though, it kind of ruined it.<br />other then that, it's pliable, just make sure you have a paintbrush and clear water on hand."
"love this stroller.  it's lightweight, fits through most doors and easy to open and close!  very satisfied!!"
very cute and durable! his singing and movement is very entertaining and loud enough to lead the birthday song at the party.
"worked as intended, look fine.  not much else to say."
very soft and good quality. my son sleeps with his every night.
love it!
"i love it, my baby loves it, talk about having a conversation starter. if you are looking at this, get one now. in fact, i am ordering more do give to my friends as a stocking stuffer."
"we bought this changing pad so we could change our baby's diaper in her bassinet without worrying about getting a mess on the sheets or mattress.  this pad folds up for easy storage, yet it's got a bit of padding to it.  it's a great size - small enough to fold up but large enough to go under the whole baby.  it's easy to clean - we just use a baby wipe."
great product.. quality made very well. a must have for all with baby's.
got this for my 1 year to transition into.  it was really easy to put together and is pretty wood. no complaints. my 5 year old jumps on it and it seems to be holding up pretty well.
love it! such a pretty color too
I love it my son looks so classy with this belt. It goes with any style pants or jeans.
"Adorable, it's exactly what I was hoping for."
"The pacifiers themselves are great, I just don't recommend the clear color, they are impossible to find once lost haha. The glow in the dark ones were my favorite for the late nights when they lose their pacis and cry, then you don't have to turn the lights on to find it!"
I like that these are more low profile than the bigger MAMs. My daughter likes these kinds but she used to get pink splotches around her mouth from the plastic resting in her skin while she sleeps. She doesn't have that with these.
Adorable!  Easy to grab by baby.
good
"We are on our third wubbanub, and not because of the wubbanub's durability, it's because my son loves his SO MUCH! We have extra just in case we lose one. Our son is almost a year old, and he sleeps with it every night. This pacifier has gotten us through the good times and bad, and I love it! The design in genius, and it is very easy to clean. I throw it in the washer, and I dry it on low. I have been doing this for a year straight and only now has the info tag started to lose it's product info. The wubbanub is well made, and comes in an array of adorable characters. Obviously, the owl is our favorite! I have purchased this product for everyone I knew who was expecting and the results are all the same - the wubbanub is the best!"
LOVE gumdrop pacifers. But beware your dogs will love them too......
"So cute, and my son loves it!"
"i need it for me baby, great."
perfect
"My daughter wouldn't have any pacifier and would only suck her bottle tit , that made her eat more then she needed afterwards she would spit it all out  but cry as she wanted to suck . I found this pacifier on internet and i, m so happy , she took it from the first moment and loves it . Easy to wash , doesn't hurt even if it falls under their had or body , only thing i would have liked if it had cover"
good
"i do not like to use paper towels or napkins because of the waste.  so, we have started using little wash cloths for my children at the dinner table.  colors are really bright and have not faded.  my children love the colors."
"i bought this product for my eight month old son after trying multiple other products that just haven't worked at all.  it has really helped to calm him down and soothe him while i know he's in so much pain.  when i first put the necklace on he was really intrigued with it, and of course wanted to put it in his mouth (he is teething and eight months), but i tucked it underneath his onesie and distracted him with another toy and the necklace was soon forgotten.  he has been so much better all day today.  i was a frazzled mom, wondering how i would get through teething with this child until i found this!"
"use these on all of our interior doors when we have our windows open.  otherwise they all end up slamming shut due to the varying air pressure (we have a lot of windows, 11 on the main floor alone).  these are nice and small, and do the job well.<br /><br />they also come in handy when the young grand kids come over, the doors can't shut on tiny little fingers.  they fit anywhere along the door edge, up and out of reach if need be.<br /><br />love em, mine serve double duty, very well!"
this thing is super simple but it made traveling with a car seat so much easier. it fit on our bag perfectly and only took about 30 second to get attached and detached. i wouldn't do air travel with a car seat with these!
love this seat. i have a 5 year old that weighs over 50 lbs and fits comfortably in this seat.
"so you are wondering if you want to purchase this clock.  after reading the reviews (not worth the price, cheap plastic, difficult to set the time, etc.), i waited another month before i finally realized something.  the people who complained about this clock do not have a child who wakes them up every morning before 5 a.m.  if, like me, your child wakes you up, wondering if it is morning, buy this clock.  no, it is not a cute accessory for your child's pottery barn bedroom.  yes, it is overpriced.  and yes, it can be &#34;difficult&#34; to set (especially if your child keeps unplugging it).  but....if you have not had a good night's sleep in three years, it is worth every penny.  sweet dreams."
perfect fit for our mini crib. waiting on baby to try it out.
"i have three of these!  after buying one and comparing it to a britax protector i bought two more.  it makes the car seat more snug fitting, and does a great job protecting leather interiors."
"i was a little skeptical because of some of the negative comments people posted, but i have to say i am in love with this crib. i am 8 months pregnant i put the crib together myself in about three hours start to finish. the directions were not hard to understand at all if you have ever assembled anything. there was a mild odor because the product is new it didn't bother me and i didn't notice it the next day. also the matter base came a little damaged as well as minor scratch on the front rail. i got right on the phone with stork craft where i was connected to a very pleasant lady who helped me out and my new parts are already being processed and sent out. the crib is pretty big once it's together but it's beautiful and i don't see how you could be disappointed at such a great deal. highly recommend :)"
perfect for my 7 months old son. he plays alone and it's safe!
this is a must have for anyone that is pumping!  makes pumping so much easier!
love this product. my daughter has lots of fun with it.
"fits perfectly, does it's job. good price."
wanted an affordable monitor to use for my disabled husband.  love the background noise cancelling feature and fact it can be carried around when not plugged in. the vtech monitor has saved me countless hours of concern when i'm not in the same room to hear my husband.
i love these. i have used them with both my kids. so much better than the throw away one's.
nice diaper bag.  well made.
had the matching stroller already and was happy to find the seat so i didn't have to buy a new travel system for the new baby.
"fit is true to size, good quality, reflects the good experiences we've had with this brand of sleepsacks in smaller sizes. zipper works well, fabric washes easily without fading."
"my grandsons loves bring up and about in this...had to get 2 they are twins, easy to clean and adjust. my daughter and i used them to travel from new jersey to florida it worked perfectly through the airport and in flight...a great buy!!"
"this was a gift to my husband, loved it!"
love it ...is very nice fast shipping is worth every penny ....
My sob loves his wubbanub so much that he has 3 I would highly recommend any of the different wubbanub creatures as my son has a dinosaur a girraffe
"So adorable and it works great, my granddaughter loves the lamb as much as the pacifier."
Good item
"Baby is straight addicted to these pacis. Easy to sterilize, and super cute design options. Mainly use while he is sleeping....when he wakes up in the middle of the night - he will search in his crib to find the paci, and will instantly fall asleep when he puts it back in his mouth."
THE PACIFIER IS PERFECT. THE SKULL LOOKS REALLY GOOD. I REALLY LIKE IT. IF YOU LIKE SKULLS. THIS ONE WORKS.
"My daughter has been using this for the past 2 years and is very attached to it.  It is durable, easily washable and great.  Especially good when she was a preemie and couldn't yet keep the pacifier in herself we could prop the animal to hold it in."
I'm so glad my baby isn't sucking on potentially toxic plastic all day long!  So happy to find a pure rubber option!
Too funny!
My son loves this brand of pacifiers. Thanks!
My grandson loves it! Will def get more!
WubbaNub! omg perfect for the newborns who are always losing their binky
Perfect!
Great paci nice size for breastfeed baby no nipple confusion
This is the only kind of pacifier my baby will use.
Great deal and so nice to have back up smoothie ! Cause in this house I have a smoothie monster always taking and never giving them back sobthis packed has been working out for us ;D
"I love these! It makes it so much easier trying to find the pacifier in the middle of the night, or in the car. My 9 month old loves these, she's gotten so used to them it's weird when she has a regilar pacifier lol."
The best pacifiers. All my kids prefer these. Now if only I could stop loosing them!
Cute and easier to use than a regular pacifier.
Adorable. We get compliments everywhere we go.
I gave this as a baby shower gift she loved it super cute
"My son's favorite paci! The holes sort of helped keeping his skin dry, but not that great."
"Our kids with small children are in the computer field, so they loved it but more importantly, they work. Put it in or give it to them and they go mute, pull it out and they sound the alarm. What more could I day"
Love it
Love these.  Baby likes them and have a great cover to toss in my purse or diaper bag.
"My 10 month old loves this, she sleeps with it every night. My favorite thing about it is that it never gets lost like her other binkies. I am going to buy an extra to keep in the diaper bag."
My little one loves the smoothie pacifier & nice change from the standard green ones
Loves it. He was very quick to love it.
Cute and much easier to use than a regular pacifier.
"It look very strong material, the shipping was fast. Thank you."
Great.
Cute and easier to use than a regular pacifier.
"This is the only type of pacifier that my baby will use. They are a great size, and easy to hold. You can buy third party pacifier clips if you want something to keep the pacifier from falling onto the ground if baby spits it out. These are also the pacifiers distributed by the hospital, so that's a great endorsement!"
good
"This is the only pacifier I will ever use. It's easy to find, the baby can hug it and does get spit out or pulled out as easily as others. Easy to wash and just hang to dry."
Fully satisfied with the product
"This is the only pacifier I will ever use. It's easy to find, the baby can hug it and does get spit out or pulled out as easily as others. Easy to wash and just hang to dry."
Great
love this product
Very nice
My nephew LOVES this.. great for them to hold on to and easier to catch if dropped
thought it would be  a bit bigger that what it is but is very cute
to cool
Very cute and functional.
Haven't been able to use these yet because the little one won't be here till February! But I know they are great products and will get much use!
"These pacis work great for a newborn.  The nipple is larger at the end which makes it easier for the little ones to keep in their mouths.  We tried the Soothie kind and without the bulge at the end, it is harder for our baby to keep it in his mouth.  We also tried the NUK brand, but those have a right side up whereas these can be put in baby's mouth either way."
Super cute to see my daughters mouth glowing as I rock her to sleep. They don't glow for very long but its a great concept.
"This pacifier is great for not only soothing your little one, but also giving them something tactile to hang on to or play with. Also, the feet are weighted slightly, helping your baby keep the pacifier in place on their chest until they can hang onto it themselves. As a final plus, the stuffed animal makes finding the pacifier a lot easier when it falls out of the car seat or crib! Great product!"
My newborn loves these! The scent does fade after being sanitized a few times but still great.
"My daughters soothie passy's go flying in a parking lot when dropped. I've lost several in her 4 short months.<br />This product helps immensely.<br />We use this when traveling in her car seat. I originally thought it was just the stuffed animal but, was pleased to find that the pacifier comes attached."
"These are Baby's favorite pacifiers. I love the glow-in-the-dark front, it enables me to find it in the middle of the night so I don't have to turn the light. It's a very durable pacifier and I don't worry about him choking on the nipple. He has used just about every pacifier made, but this is by far the best, for him and for us!"
"Great price, awesome buy. It's much more affordable to buy this three pack then one at a time... plus I can't even handle how cute they are :)"
Baby loves it. Pediatric Dentist Suggested. A bit expensive and we all love free shipping but worth it to save on dental bills later. Would recommend to a friend.
"My daughter loves her caterpillar.  Not only does the pacifier soothes her, the caterpillar soothes her while see sleeps. She loves to hold it and feel the soft material. It's was so said, we just lost it. It seems like it's harder for her to fall asleep without the caterpillar at the other end. We will be getting a new one."
great
These are the only binks my daughter likes. I think the price is better here than in the stores too.
These are the only pacifiers my son loves. Beautiful designs and affordable price.
My daughter loves it! Wish it was just a little bigger but she holds it perfectly in her little hands!
"We liked this guys so much we ordered a second so if it was every lost or dirty we have a back up.  This little guy has saved us so many times.  He sits on our 2 month old's chest and makes it so if she stops sucking for a minute it doesn't fall out. when she was smaller we could even tuck it into her swaddle. Its also much easier to find than a regular pacifier, added bonus we didn't think of. We've been using it since day one and couldn't be happier with it.  We have the monkey one as well but it falls out much easier than this one."
Perfect!!!
Great!
"We tried several different pacifiers, but these are my babies' favorite ones. Light, not too big and have air flow. Much better than the rest of pacifiers on the market."
Great Product
we were having trouble finding mittens for our newborn boy (he has long fingers) and these fit the bill!!! so happy with them.
love that had the latch system
"really love the entire thermos foogo line. bottle is easy to clean, and i love that it has a good, secure lid. no, this is not a leak-proof bottle when the lid is open, but i don't think they claim it to be at all. it is leak-proof with the lid closed. i also love that the shape and size are very easy to fit in the diaper bag."
"awesome must have for every parent! my grandson loves his!! i recommend this,it may cost a little more but it's worth every penny!! you'll be thankful that you bought it too when those monkeys are distracting your little one and giving you a much needed time out. lol"
"this scarf is amazingly lightweight, great coverage, and the loop helps prevent it from slipping off while you feed.  i haven't worn it as a scarf, but it folds up really small for easy storage in his diaper bag.  washes really easily.<br /><br />i'm 5'11 and when wearing this it falls just below my hips."
"we've been using these thermos foogo phases bottles for a while now with our sons. we have the non-insulated straw bottles and the insulated, stainless steel straw bottles. i like the pretty design on this one for our daughter. it keeps her milk cold for hours on end while we are out and  about, especially if i keep it in an insulated cooler bag with an ice pack. i'm planning to take it with us on our flight to maui next month, so she'll have whole milk during her flight, which the airline may or may not carry. the bottle is sturdy and i like the flip-top cap, which keeps the straw clean when not in use. it's also easy to use, so that my 19-month old can open and close it on her own. it does spill, however, so i do have to keep any eye on her when she's using it."
o like very good
these are the only pacifiers my son will use. my order came promptly and correctly. the only drawback i would mention about this product is that because the pacifiers are rubber they bounce when they hit the ground and debris sticks to the very easily.  amazon service was excellent as usual.
"great gate. intalls easily and is very durable. does everything a gate is supposed to do, and it looks nice."
"looks great, doesnt slide, easy to clean and superior slip proofing for any ages. much better than those tacky stickers."
"great stuff. it smells good, is gentle on the skin, cleans well, and lasts a long time. for over 8 months starting when my baby was a newborn, i've had no problems."
brieanna loved it.  she is having a boy and is so excited.
love love love.  the monthly pictures are great with these
this item was larger than it appeared in the pictures so it was added value in my mind. it can be hung on a mobile or just placed on baby's tummy or lap because it's easy to grab and investigate. the colors and textures are a big attraction and give visual stimulation as well as sensory stimulation.
"Daughter loved these from when she was an infant!  They are very durable and last for as long as you have them (until they are lost or the dog eats them ;))<br /><br />Definitely recommended!  After these, she wouldn't entertain any others!"
Best pacifier we've tried.
"Crazy expensive and hard to find, but I suppose there's a reason for that.  My kids love these, and I'm glad because the two-piece ones gross me out.  These are very easy to clean.  Trivial fact-- one of my twins prefers his upside-down, and it looks like a little mustache.  Cute."
"I love these bottles feed. My boy is 11months and never a single colic.<br />It can be washed so easily, i gain so much time.<br />Thanks MAM, moreover i've got 4 for the price of 2.5 ;)"
One of my granddaughter's favorite pacifiers.  Easy for parents and grandmas to find!
"My son loves these.<br />We always had problems losing the pacifiers, until we found these.<br />They also help with hand-eye co-ordination. He learned at a very young age how to put the paci back in his mouth, also it was so much easier for him to find his paci.<br /><br />I just want to make sure when you wash these in the washer machine, you let them air dry."
"these worked great, love that are dishwasher safe"
"We got turned onto the Wubbanub later than I'd have liked, went the first few months dropping pacifiers all over the place.  This is adorable and helps baby hold onto it.  He's 7 months now and still loving it, even once he has teeth I think we'll keep using it and just keep an eye on it to make sure he doesn't chew through it (it's the softer soothie made for younger babies).  We prefer the elephant to the giraffe, it's just a bit cuter and I actually think it balances better on his chest."
Fun

great owl thing
Looks great and very cute item!
Super cute & very soft.
Love it
I purchased this for a friend who still breastfeeds her baby. It worked wonderfully. She is able to still breastfeed while occasionally bottle feeding. The baby likes these bottles.
Bought this for my newborn who is now 15 months old. This is now his &#34;soothie.&#34; He calls it his &#34;baby&#34; and it totally still comforts him. I buy these for all my expecting friends now.
Beautiful colors!!!!
Just like what out hospital gives the new borns.
What a good idea a little stuffed animal on a binky.
"I cannot say enough about these Wubbanubs but the lamb aka mimi has become my daughters favorite thing to her. MIMI was her fist word. Lamby has been a huge part of our daughter now 16 months. We had to finally get a back up after the first once finally snapped off, but it took a year of hard abuse before it finally broke!"
SO glad I bought this!
my daughter loves it right away
Simply the best
"Absolute life saver, my daughter wouldn't be without it. Had to buy 4 of them in case as was the case one got lost.<br />Can't go to bed without it.<br />Would recommend to any parent.<br />Never loose your babies dummy and when its worn it can be replaced."
Greatest invention ever!!!!!!!!
"Can't live with out this product!!! Since day 1 til now (7months) she has used & enjoyed all these products.  I breasted w/o any issues.Perfect for little hands & mouths. They are the easiest to clean. She gums almost every part of the wubby.  Also my dtr is so fickle that she refuses other pacifiers & will scream until I give her a Wubbanub. (I have tried other pacifiers ie dr browns, tommee tippee, etc but without luck.)  Can't say enough good about this product."
These are the best thing ever. Not only is it the only pacifier my son will take but now he has a buddy that he loves to cuddle with
Great
Obviously it was for a joke and NOT a baby. NOT baby safe but certainly worth a laugh.
Awesome like always.
My son loves his Wubbanub. I couldn't find a back up giraffe at the store so I'm so happy they have one on Amazon:) now we have 3.
My little guy would take any pacifier - still does BUT couldn't keep any of the other pacifiers for long bc they were pretty heavy.  This one is amazingly light and easy for LO to keep in their mouth themselves which keeps us new moms sane :)
"I love natural rubber pacifiers. This one is really pliable and soft and my daughter just loves it. It is sanitary because water doesn't get trapped in. It does not leave marks on her face or when it falls out during sleep and she rolls over on it. I just wish it were a bit cuter, they should make the cutout a cute shape like a crown or flower like the Hevea ones."
God-son loves this :)  Wish they were available at more local stores too :)  Pricey though.shew!!  Don't like that you can't exchange pasies with it...
Product arrived in perfect condition!!!!! Love it!!  Just wish they would make a horse or pony one!!
"The only pacifier that our baby would consistently take. Great to be able to get several at a low price so we could keep one everywhere we needed it - diaper bag, daycare, nursery, car seat (our car seat has a little tag that is at the perfect location to have the pacifier reach the baby when used with an Ulubulu pacifier clip), etc."
"Can't live with out this product!!! Since day 1 til now (7months) she has used & enjoyed all these products.  Perfect for little hands & mouths. They are the easiest to clean. She gums almost every part of the wubby.  Also my dtr is so fickle that she refuses other pacifiers & will scream until I give her a Wubbanub.

Love love love these!!!!!! They are worth every penny.  Used them for my now 2 1/2 year old as well and are using them for my 6 month old.  Gives them something to grab on to. Gives you something more to catch when they start to fall. Love them!!!
Favorite favorite favorite. This maker has always been my FAVORITE!
"Great product, great price! I have no idea about the other reviews I found these to be very soft."
Great product
The baby love's it. It is great in size and shape. Product very well made.
"arrive on time, its like the picture , I have a baby boy so I am happy to receive the blue one, in general breastfeeding babies do not like pacifier I tried many but this one stay in my baby mouth a little bit so I think with the time he will like it."
"This here is her best friend! She loves it, doesnt like other wubbanubs- the monkey takes the cake!"
Comes with the right color. This is the only one that my son can hold on his mouth.
My child loves it and it is super easy to wash and for him to find it when he wakes up at night; which translated in more sleep for parents!
Best soothers on the market
"don't know what i'd do without these. we have a bunch of avent soothies that just sit now because these nuk pacis are the only ones she really likes, AND they don't fall out of her mouth as easily so we don't have to constantly be putting the paci back in her mouth as she cries."
It works very well.
very cute and works great with the diaper bag I bought.  It holds 2 pacifiers and holder.
Excellent service and product!
I've bought these as gifts and babies seem to really love holding a soft plush toy while using the pacifier. It keeps the pacifier in place and allows the baby to get it themselves when it falls out of their mouth.
I just purchased this for my daughter who is 5 1/2 weeks old. I also bought the Tabby Kitten so we could always have 2 on hand if one of them is in the wash. I will say she handles this better than the kitten at the moment. She's still learning how to grip things and kitten actually falls out of her mouth more easily. This caterpiller stays put. Well worth the money and it's super cute!
My friend loved the product. Very reasonable & got the product in time for her baby shower. Thanks!
perfect!!
Quality was great would buy more in future there so funny
"Made everyone laugh at the shower, and is a workable pacifier."
Couldnt live without these. Very nipple like which is great! They do tend to feel sticky sometimes but they are awesome. We have three!
Great!!
Great product and condition
My son loves this! And its easy to find!
My newborn baby loves this pacifier at the hospital-he even uses his hand to hold it in place.  So I am buying two more.
"All 3 of our boys loved these. The hospital and the over the counter ones never cut it apparently, LOL."
As advertised. Well packaged and product was in great shape. My kid loves these pacifiers.
It's perfect!  Get 2
Very cute product bought for my grandaughter.
Glow in the dark pacifiers...genius!!! Our little one loves the MAM pacifiers (won't take any others since we started using them). These are great to be able to find in the middle of the night.
Bought this for my newborn (2 week old) bc I used this pacifier for my older son when he was new born. I tried the soothie kind coz they say that's more like a nipple but actually my boys both liked the mams.  Just got to hold it in as with any newborn till they grow used to a pacifier.
Love this pacifier!  Easy to clean. We just toss in the wash and it dries quickly. My daughter loves chewing on the ears.
I like it very well.
awesome and adorable for reborn babies!:)
"My daughter had no trouble adjusting to the new nipple design debuted by Tommee Tippee. It is more like a bottle, but still considered &#34;orthodontic&#34;. I prefer the Tommee Tippee mouthpiece design like this because it is more breathable, and less irritating to her skin. It also has the handle which allows her to hold onto them better when she takes them out of her mouth. My daughter sleeps with a nightlight, so I haven't paid much attention to the glow-in-the-dark feature, but the celestial designs are very pretty & good for a boy or girl."
Arrived in a timely manner . this is sooooo cute especially in person !
Worth the extra cost simply because it's so much easier to find now! Our daughter is still too little to hold onto it but I could see her doing so in no time which is another perk as hopefully then it's not falling out 50 times per minute. We also have an active toddler boy so something like that matters to us :) Only thing that could make it better was if it also sang lullabies.
"Item delivered on time, was as described. LOVE IT!"
Haven't found one that hasn't been enjoyed.  When I put together a diaper cake or gift basket I want one of these included.  They are fun and useful.
Good product and our grandbaby like it.
"Adorable! Bought as a gag gift for baby, everybody loved it."
Good quality
"i love blocks, so does my nephew. the difference is i enjoy construction, he enjoys catapulting them across the room, much to my sisters dismay as they crash through anything in their path. these solve that. he can build, chew and even launch them, all without breaking anything (or anyone) the colors are great, and it seems to be something that has kept his attention. he is 18 months now and has had them for about a year. they also seem to be holding up great!"
"the dresser has delivered faster than what they told me. i installed it by myself and very easy. i love the material too, i think the top and sides are made by real wood, they are thick and heavy. i was thinking to buy changing table but i decided to just put the changing table on top of this dresser, because the height is perfect to me, no need changing table anymore... safe money and space in the room for something else!"
he really enjoyed it and i like that it is not huge!
"before my twins were born, i purchased another brand of bottle, thinking it would be the perfect bottle for them. however, after being born premature with some reflux and colic issues, i was struggling to find a bottle that was the perfect size and also helped prevent air from getting through. i received a 3 pack of these as a baby shower gift and since opening the box, this has been the only brand of bottle i have used! i have purchased several sets of these (in both the blue/clear combination as well as the pink/purple combination) and so far, at 9 months i have yet to have to replace any of the bottles or pieces. i know some people say these bottles have a lot of parts (bottle, stem, rubber &#34;cap&#34; for stem, nipple ring and nipple) however they are all extremely easy to clean (i just put everything in the top rack of the dishwasher with the smaller parts in a smaller basket made for baby items) and you can assemble quickly. after 100+ washes in the dishwasher, they still stand up well. a few bottles have started to &#34;warp&#34; - meaning the bottoms of the bottles have become more rounded vs. flat, but they still stand up on their own. (which we can't expect them to last forever, right?) i highly recommend these bottles!"
my granddaughter is crazy about elephants and she has many stuffed ones on her bed.  i got this for her room after it was painted and time to redecorate.  these elephants and birds look great!  she loves them.  i did not want to apply them directly to the wall so i pressed them onto contact paper and cut them out to place on the wall.
my son has always loved these. so when i seen these 3 i couldn't resist
fun gift for a friend's baby. She loved it ;)
i am have extremely fair skin so sunburn is nothing new to me. this aloe cream is the best product i have ever used. i did not peal at all and my burn healed within three days. i will never use anything else on a sunburn. this product is amazing!
"i did a bit of research before buying a tv strap. found this one to be well made and works great! like all the other reviews, i too found the screws to be too short so i simply got longer ones. works great. very happy with it."
beautiful bright colors !  very cushiony for comfort on babies knees.  there isn't any odor like most<br />vinyls.
unit is awesome it paired to my iphone 5s and ipad 2 using the googo app it sends a nice quality video with audio. only down side is because it connects via wifi you won't get emails or run some apps during it but small price to pay for this little technological treasure.
a+ fast shipping.  great to deal with.
"my daughter loves it!  it is light weight, the wheels are move easily over all terrain.  closes very simply as advertised.  just love it!"
my wife picked this car seat and she is in love with it!  she loves the color and i have to say the colors and the soft breathable materials keep the car seat very cool.  it doesn't get hot like all the other car seats made out of that polyester shiny material.<br />i like that it is very safe and our 13 month old is very protected and comfortable in this car seat.
LOVE WUBBAS!
"These items are $10/15 in the stores.  This was a great gift for my husband, for my daughter."
Love!!
My grandson luvs them.  He looks so cute sucking on them.
these are great little belts for the money and work well in my sidecar. they fit in the tight sides perfectly! the quality is good to boot and with fast shipping from the hand in texas.
"excellent product, very attentive and quick to shipping, thanks"
love that this is adjustable and truly hands free!
"this crib is gorgeous! so worth the price, sturdy, and will serve us for years to come. it was a little confusing to put together as the directions are not super clear but we had a friend who is a pro come and help my husband set it up. other reviews said it smelled of paint but i did not have this problem and we let it sit in the box for weeks before putting it all together. 100% happy with this crib!"
"i was hoping this organizer would work well for my freezer. it works better than i could have hoped for. i use the medela bags and they fit just fine in this organizer. the only thing is i wished it had one more plastic separator for between the bags, since i come home from work with 3 bags to freeze. i love how the lid flips over for extra storage."
"very sturdy! i love them and have found numerous uses for these besdesstrollers and walkers. my canopy poles, for display, my seats at the beach tohold my bag..,even used one on a tension pole to hold extra hand bags. these are great!"
great frame! i was looking for a nice frame that covers the first year of my baby's life. this is just what i was looking for.
these are great to put in a diaper to catch overnight leakage!
"i purchased these bandana bibs for my nephew, and they look really cute. since he's teething, he is always drooling, but the bibs keep his clothes dry, and they keep him comfortable. they are soft and very comfortable. my sister is always getting compliments on how cool they look."
"these bottles work well with my pump, are easy clean, and i love that they are bpa free."
love this mat. it is super soft.
this is what we needed a simple monitor that does the job in a larger house without breaking the bank. i have other things to do that with. we do not get static. this is our second one due to our 10 yr playing with our old one and breaking it no fault of the monitor. looked around and this gets a great range for the price and quality.
love it. spacious. isn't air airtight but don't think it claims to be. use for chips and snacks in my daughter's school lunches. or non juicy fruit. i wash w soap and water and dry in dish rack. very happy.
super soft and wishes very well. would purchase again
my granddaughter would hug the giraffe but wasn't much interested in the pacifier.
excellent
great diaper bag with plenty of room and storage. seems to be sturdy built and reliable!
really does not leak. it's kind of big around for tiny hands but even a two year old can carry it with one hand.
"finally someone has made a decent looking, durable toddler seat.  this is not the seat for you if you've got a child that requires restraint or needs the seat to be stably attached to a chair/stool but if you have an older toddler who really just needs the &#34;boost&#34; you can't go wrong with this one.  cushion comes off for easy cleaning and back folds down for convenient, compact storage."
these are great. they're just like the ones they give you at the hospital.
"daughter loves the infantino grow-with-me activity gym & ball pit. so far she is only old enough to be using the stage 1 toys, but will soon be able to start holding and playing with the balls for the pit. at times she will even fall asleep playing for so long under it while still holding onto the toys. product seems well built and i am completely satisfied with the purchase."
"amazing, love, love, love it !!! all 5 stars all the way !<br />i would buy this stroller all over again. so easy to fold, perfect size. my husband is 6'5&#34; and i am 5'4&#34; and new improved handle works for both of us beautifully. it &#34;glides&#34; on the pavement, turns so well.<br />it fits in my toyota carolla trunk with such ease and i think i could fit another one of these strollers if i wanted to. still have so much space of rather large items.<br />it is a bit heavier than i thought, but still happy with the overall weight.<br />also with the car seat adapter my peg perego car seat fits beautifully with just one click it is locked in! i love it, functional, saves time, and made my life so much more easy.<br />also on amazon it was prices the best, lots of other sites wanted over $350.00 for this stroller, amazon has the best deal by far, i also combined it with an extra 20% coupon on top of the deal.<br />i highly recommend this one, it is a keeper!!!"
i bought this for a new mommy.  her husband has told me that this is the best gift of all the baby gifts.  it got rave reviews from the user!!
very good!!!
"looks exactly as pictured, nice bib, well made."
this little lamb is so soft and makes a nice gentle rattling sound when you shake it.
"one of the best things we could have purchased. the dr. brown's bottle warmer works very well and warms a room temperature bottle up in 3 minutes or so. a bottle out of the refrigerator takes about another minute or so, still very fast and much better than using the microwave in my opinion.<br /><br />one suggestion i do have is to occasionally (maybe weekly) dump the water out of the inside of the warmer and clean the inside as well as the part the reservoir goes into and the reservoir itself.<br /><br />we were not doing this initially and it got a little smelly and we had to give it a good cleaning, then rinse with water and a little vinegar then rinse a bunch more to be sure it was clean.<br /><br />obviously make certain everything is dry before plugging it back in and do not submerge it in water or overly drench it around the electronics or you will most likely damage the unit or potentially hurt yourself."
these cup are great for small children
makes life much easier.  we use it to mix up enfamil ar and now only have to once a day instead of 2-3 times a day.  when i added all the powder at once for 32 oz it did clump a little.  found that if i add powder in smaller amounts there are no clumps.
"i used this set when my husband was ill and bedridden.  while i worked at my desk in another room, he could just speak to me in a natural tone of voice, and i could go to him right away and see to his needs.  sound pickup is great.  i could even know if he was over-feeding treats to our pudgy little dog!  i'd hear him say, &#34;that's all.  all gone.&#34; then i'd go to them, see the confectioners sugar on both their mouths, and do the appropriate fussing while they both looked so guilty. he was feeding her &#34;people&#34; donuts!  i carried the monitor in my pocket when doing household chores, so i could know if he had a need.  this item is very handy, and i recommend it."
my husband loved it! item exactly as described. ink washes off baby's hands easily
my daughter has been feeding herself with these utensils for a few months now (she's 20 months).  she's still a messy eater but is getting better.  she's never had any issues holding the spoons/forks.  sometimes she still needs help scooping up certain foods but the utensils themselves are good.  they were originally part of a gift basket from a relative and i had been unsuccessful in locating them in stores so i could purchase some more. i was happy to find them here.
great fun for kids.
"my daughter loves to drop things from her high chair, car seat, stroller or anywhere that she can her it crash on the floor. this works great to save you time from constantly picking toys up or when your out and about with your lo you can rest assured that your lo toy didn't fall out in one of the many places you've been to..."
the cutest thing ever!  our grandbaby loves it.  she spins the flowers on the mirrors.  the stirring wheel plays several different songs.  love it
this bag is great and could pack quite lot of stuff for its depth and height. there is a comfortable shoulder strap that makes carry around quite a breeze. the color's cool in black and makes it even more stylish.
"works just like it should. simple, portable, fast."
best purchase ever
Was a gift and was very warmly received
Love the wubbanubs! Can't find them locally! My newborn grew out of the Soothie pretty quickly and switched to a regular pacifier but she liked to hold the animal.
Perfect
All my nursed babies loved these!
So cute. Bought it as a gift and she loved it. Quick delivery and great price!
They're delicious!
"For a special needs baby who needed the extra girth of the attached puppy to find his pacifier! perfect solution!! Puppy is much lighter than you'd think, however.  I thought the weight of the puppy would be able to sit on his chest for ease."
Very good
"I love Avent products anyway, but the fact that this has UK references on it was a big selling point for me. The package came very quickly and I would definitely recommend this seller again!"
Grandson's favorite pacifier
I love these pacifiers! They have been the preferred brand for both my sons. The glow in the dark is an added bonus when I have to search for my son's paci in the middle of the night because he has woken up fussing for it.
"Our baby got her teeth early so these are her constant companions. The pacifier are a good size, wash well, have a top that helps with drainage after washing, and most importantly, stand up to the constant use our daughter gives them.<br />We have several of these pacifiers and they are worth every penny !"
"Great, excelent, 100% recommended"
Very cute! looks nice on the pictures! We sent postcard with our baby's photo with this pacifier to his grandfather. He was thrilled!
its perfect product
"baby loved this for the first few months. it helped to keep it near him when he was too little to grab it. also, it's very cute!"
"Of all the WubbaNub's we own, this one is the best.  First of all, the giraffe is longer and therefore has more for our daughter to clutch.  Second, even if our daughter doesn't want to chew the pacifier, she can still grab a leg to suck on.  This giraffe has all kinds of appendages she can harass.<br /><br />We own the lamb, frog, and chick too, but the giraffe is her favorite, which also makes it our favorite."
EXCELLENT!
work great
Love the pacifier but my nephew wouldn't use it because he didn't like the nipple.
"I purchased as requested by a mom-to-be, and it made a great add-on gift to tie to the package."
My baby loves her Lamby!  We got one as a shower gift and I bought another one as a back up because she loves it so much.  This is by far my favorite baby item.
"These are my son's preferred pacifier. We don't use a pacifier often, but it better be one of these when we do! Also, they are the most similar to the pacifier that he was given at the hospital when he was born."
pet gate fits perfectly in my bedroom door and looks really good.
"threw my 6 month old boy on this thing, he fell in love with it instantly. i also bought some gym mats to go under it so when he falls and smashes his head into it, the tile doesn't break his skull. if you have gym mats or carpet, this thing is wonderful. if you have tile or a hard floor, it's definitely not thick enough to prevent brain damage (haha). but seriously, its entertaining for the baby, just put some support under it."
i ordered this pillow for my 21 month old. she's just starting to play &#34;night night&#34; and ask to use our pillows when sitting on our bed or the couch. this is perfect. it's a great size for her and the pillow is so super soft. i am glad i purchased this for her. we also bought the toddler pillowcase that accompanies the pillow which was also a great material and fit very well. i would definitely recommend this product and plan to purchase future pillows as my daughter grows from a little pillow co.&#34;.
great for traveling or keeping in your bag for dinners out. the crumb catcher is awesome.
love this! makes it so much easier to carry the car seat with one hand.
best choice
"so much better than the boppy and deflatability came in very handy for travelling.  in fact, i used this as my primary nursing pillow."
"i love the idea of bumpers because my daughter sleeps with her arms straight out and was getting them caught inbetween the slats of her crib. however, traditional bumpers are scary so i was glad i found the mesh ones. they look nice and fit snuggly and keep my daughter from getting caught and give me peace of mind."
"i think they work very well, i have been using them for more than a month."
excellent product. lasted a whole year this far. gave it to my sister in law.
"what's not to love about turning your little girl (or boy) into a lobster fresh out of the tub?  it's hilarious, and my 6 month old little girl seems to find it comfortable enough to enjoy (we purchased it back when she was 5 months old and it worked just as well)."
"we apparently have a convertible crib with huge rails.  these wouldn't even wrap half way around.  i think the narrow ones are only good for the cheaper cribs sold at big box stores.  anything of furniture quality will need the wide version.<br /><br />that said don't hesitate to buy them.  they are easy to install, remove and wash.  we looked at a few different rail covers and these were the nicest.  trend lab seems to have a supply problem though since we weren't able to get any color accept brown for the front and natural for the sides."
we have been very satisfied with this car seat. i researched for weeks and finally ordered the britax roundabout. it is comfortable and secure. thank you britax!
it's really cute!!!
i love this product! it works great! my three year old son used to cry every time i washed his hair during bath time because he hates water going in his face/eyes. this has been such a lifesaver! no more tears during bath time! he loves it and so do i!
great items
baby loves the taste and really enjoys chewing on my finger with the finger brush.
works great.
great traveling high chair and we used it as a transition into the full-sized high chair.
"just received and installed the easy close metal gate.  was extremely impressed with how easy it was to install and especially how durable it is.  i especially like the gate opener mechanism, not one that a child could easily work.  well done!"
"awesome product, was true to fit, stood up to repeated uses and washings."
Great product.
Love Mary Meyer Wubbanub! Very well made
This brand was recommended by our lactation consultant and seem to do a good job of soothing our son without causing any nipple confusion.
So happy that Nuk finally started making smaller pacifiers.
I have several of these because we can't be caught without them. Baby loves them and we all want baby happy...
Fast shipping and it's absolutely adorable!
perfect for baby
Very good case for all kinds of pacifier. I'm using it for the Gumdrop and it fits perfectly and keeps it clean
My son is in love with these!
My son would not take any other pacifier this the first one he will actually use. Love the openness so he doesn't get red around his mouth.
:)
great
Gave it as a gift.. they were so pleased they said it was their favorite one!
"My son loved this toy so much, I had to order two more, just to be sure there was one at the house, one in his bag, and one in reserve. I found he chewed on the legs and tail as much as the pacifier. I ended up putting the whole thing in the dishwasher and then letting it air dry to ensure that it was clean and sanitary. It's been more than a year since I purchased my first one, and my son still loves it."
these are our preferred paci at our house.  Glow in the dark makes it easy to find in the middle of the night.
the ribbons arrived 2-3 days after i ordered them and look great.
these are great diapers to fold and lay in a diaper cover.  no snappi necessary!  as my daughter continues to grow i will use them as doublers.
beautiful crib! and very sturdy!
"lite-on-shoulder exceeded my expectations.  it's very durable.  i was able to use it for my five-month-old baby and my three-year-old toddler while on vacation.  i use it every day for my now seven-month-old baby.  he loves being in it while carry him around the store, the park, or wherever."
super cute and great quality !
I'm so happy I finally bought this! My 9 month old would always fall hard on the hard mat his Baby Trend pack n play came with. This fits SO snugly and it doesn't move. Even with all his rolling and bouncing around! I'm pregnant with my 2nd and will use this until he/she gets big enough for a crib. I just wish I had this when my 9 month old slept in his pack n play.
"These are the best pacifiers! I love the Monkey, because of all the textures. This is our second one of this design. My little one wore the first one out. He is 9 months old, but he doesn't have any teeth yet. So we are still using these. You may want to consider a orthodontic pacifier once they have teeth. I wish they would make them with an orthodontic pacifier attached for later. I will be buying these as gifts for anyone expecting. You can easily wash them in the washer to keep them clean. One thing that is nice is being able to grab them easy if they are dropped. You can not go wrong with any of these!"
Awesome awesome awesome !!! My son is 6 mos and still LOVES this thing!!<br />It came on Thursday & ordered it on Tuesday late late night
The best
These are the best pacifiers!
"We love these for the size and the fact that they're made of one piece of material.  Of course, none of that matters if your kid doesn't like them and our do."
Love these bottles and so does my daughter
"I m very pleased with this, in turtle theme baby gift basket.  Can't speak as to actual use but I am pleased with quality."
"Fantastic product, was told by the hospital we wouldn't be able to fine anything similar to the one my lo was given on the nicu"
Exactly as described! Way too cute!
This is a great idea for infants. The shape and weight of the toy helps keep the pacifier in place.
Binkies are the best. These were a gift for a friend.
"My little 2 month old likes to eat so much she will overeat and vomit. Now I give this to her when I think she has eaten enough.  She actually hugs it to her, pulls its ears, and has stopped eating too much.  If she is full, her elephant soothes her, and if not, she pulls it out and cries for more food!"
Good chose
LOVE this pacifier! My grandson is 3 months old and loves it! Wish they had had these when my kids were little!
I love these. I just wish they came in colors so we could find them easier. The binky monster strikes again! I know he is hoarding them somewhere.
"My 7 month old daughter loves her wubbanubs! We keep one in each crib. She cuddles and plays with the little animal while she pacifies herself. The attached animal makes it easy for her to find her binky in the dark, so Mom and Dad can sleep. :)  These are great. And inexpensive enough to have one at home, daycare, and Grandma's!  Besides being practical, they are very cute!!! Highly recommend!"
My kid won't live without this. He's now 8 months. I bought two!
"this is a great crib liner.  it's sturdy enough, yet breathable for my little guy that tosses around all night."
"this is a little pricey, but way cheaper than buying a new car that has ac vents in the back. i feel good knowing that when we get in the car & it's cold/hot my kids get collen's down/ warmed up faster."
exactly what i wanted! makes walks and outing very convenient.
very user friendly and so comfortable for babies. dries quickly and stores easily with hanging loop. also great newborn photo prop.
"fits perfectly, and super cute"
great seat!  very easy to use.
"i absolutely love this! my little guy was constantly resting his feet on the back of the seat, which would always lead to kicking. since using this product he has stopped. i also like that it is easy to install. i recently switched car seats and it easily adapted to the new seat. i would recommend this product to all parents or anyone who cares for children that are in a car seat or booster."
great for picnics!
"at least 12 of so far 17 1-star ratings complained of the frame being &#34;bent&#34;.  at least 12 of the 17 apparently did not read the instructions.  the frame is intentionally &#34;bent&#34; so that when properly installed and adjusted, the upper tensions knobs extend to apply pressure at the sides, which not only closes up the gap but applies pressure to the door frame making it nearly impossible to push the gate over. this is an excellently engineered product and operates exactly as described, but only when installed and adjusted according to the instructions (that's why instructions are included and are intended to be read and followed). i highly recommend this gate which i purchased to replace an older, worn out gate of much lesser quality."
"i have a three month old and the amount of stuff we have to take on a day outing is crazy!  i pack a lot of stuff. probably more then i need, but i like to feel prepared.  i have a cute little diaper bag, but that is just it, it was too small to take if i was going out for more then a few hours.<br /><br />in this backpack i can fit: house bottle warmer, car charger bottle warmer, jacket, hand pump, sunscreen, beg spray, small cereal container, small toys(3), 10 size 1 diapers, wipes, baggies to put dirty diapers in, changing pad, thermometer, diaper rash cream, gripe water, gas drops, pacifiers, three outfits, 2 receiving blankets, and 2 bottles.  most of the time i also out my cell phone and wallet in the big pocket too.<br /><br />the main compartment it huge!  i can fit so much into it.  the half circle pocket on the top is bigger then it looks and i keep cloths in it.  the large side pockets i use for diapers and changing pads.  i do not use the hard wipe case that came with the bag.  i put on of the soft disposable wipe packs into it and so far it works great.  the two pockets that i have not quite mastered filling are the sipper pocket on the flap and the one under the half circle.  the sipper pocket on the flap is small.  i have put pacifiers, keys, and cellphones in it but none seem to fit quite right.  the pocket below the circle pocket i have put the health care stuff, cell phone, keys, cloths, sun hats, but again nothing seems quite right.  the best fit for this pocket so far is the sunhat and sunglasses for the baby.<br /><br />overall, this bag is amazing!  so roomy and easy to full.  to help my husband when i ask him to find something i got key chains that can be written on and attached them to each pocket. i have listed what is in the pocket so he or a sitter can easily locate what they need.<br /><br /> it is a great bag for me to take to town or take to the baby sitters for the day.  it also worked well on vacation.  i was able to keep it upfront with me and i had what ever i needed."
"worked well, and gave many more uses than expected. ink was easily cleaned off."
"great bibs, easy to wipe clean and nice to have the bottom pouch to catch drips and spills. if you like keith haring and dr<br />seus, you will enjoy the cute graphics on the bibs as well."
nice to have extra padding for the extra absorbance!
great for travel potty for the grandchildren
excellent articule
attractive color
fit and quality is great
really nice gate! this is so much easier to use than having to pull up on the wooden gates and then setting the gate off to the side!
love this.  great quality and quick shipping.
just wanted to say i had a very very very positive experience with albeebaby in terms of return of this item and obtaining a replacement. albeebaby has a customer in me for life. they were very responsive and  sent the replacement stroller timely with the minimum of fuss. thank you
i researched bibs quite extensively and had to look hard to find this.  i finally choose it b/c of the fact that it wrapped around the child's body prohibiting them pulling it over their head (which happens a lot!).  it is adjustable and is so easy to clean and unlike other bibs.  going to restaurants and worrying about extra messes is no longer an issue because it can be wiped down quickly and stored cleanly in the diaper bag.  i've had several comments that people are impressed with the bib.  i just went to amazon to purchase several for shower gifts and was extremely disappointed to find that they are no longer in stock. i hope this changes soon.
"i loved my monitor so much that i had to buy another one for the new baby! such a great picture, a great lasting battery, and everything about it is easy to use. i've had my first one for 2 years and have never had an issue with it, so i kow this is a product that can last through a lot of hours of use."
"i purchased this for my 2.5 year old for traveling and he loves it. it folds up so small and takes up little space in the car. when unfolded, it's a comfortable place for my toddler to nap and sleep at night."
the original battery on the avent baby monitor dropped to under 4 hours after 18 months of daily use.  this battery starts with over 30 hours lifetime.
"These things are so awesome!  Perfect for when you are holding a teething baby.  They are always going for your necklace and trying to chew on it.  While not exactly what you would call fashionable, you don't look a fool wearing them.  They can get down on these with no worries.  Love them!"
Perfect! Baby girl loves these and I love that they are dentist approved!
"It has that uneven shaped nipple with a flat part on it. Baby is picky about which pacifiers he will use, but he liked this one. And looked adorable in it. Signed, big brother."
"So.... my baby girl started with the gumdrop pacifier from the hospital when she turned 1 month old. I tried until 8 months old to switch to other paci that i thought would be better shaped for her mouth since she loooooooves to suck all the time...<br />well not other would do as the one from the hospital. So after buying so many others I bought those ones hoping they would do the trick (when she was about 7 months).<br />Well it is perfect! They are of hard but yet soft plastic so no fear of her breaking them, they have a little handle with a hole so I use a paci holder, they are the exact same size as the gumdrop we got from the hospital.<br />They are great for breastfed babies from my experience, as they reproduce the nipple quite nicely.<br />They do not leave marks on the baby face while sucking on them, and fall of the mouth easily when they stop sucking - i like that as compared to some others that they keep the whole time even after they passed out.<br />So far I have still been using the same one for the past 2 months so they are durable.<br />They also wash well : dishwasher or mild soap, the water does not get stocked into it so I feel it is healthier/cleaner than other ones.<br />Overall very satisfied"
Great product!!!
"Love these their so cute & from these guys a lot cheaper then my local stores I can buy it from , I have absolutely no complaints at all , and have ordered several times here for gift"
Great fun for all!
"Super cute!  Looks great, and good quality!"
"For a while these were the only pacifiers that my baby would take. I tried many different kinds and he would just gag and spit them right out. He was 2 months at the time, so it wasn't as though I was forcing a newborn to take some massive pacifier. These were great in the newborn size for my easy gagging child. Life saver!"
good
"Not a day passes without needing these!<br />They're hollow and see through. Looking through the cavity while the baby is chewing on them is mesmerising 0_0 hehe<br />Plus, if you look at them while the nipple is facing you directly, you'll notice that they're shaped to look like a smiling pinocchio :o)"
"I bought this for my newest nephew, knowing my oldest nephew adored his, and had quite the collection, so far he loves it!"
This is my daughter's favorite. We have multiple but this one is so soft and sweet. You will not be disappointed. When u need to clean just out then in a cotton pillowcase and run through the washing machine and low dryer setting. Our baby falls asleep with this and then holds into it in the night like a baby. So sweet and they work.
The only paci my newborn would take for more than 10 seconds. I bought a dozen of these just in case.
My 5 month old grandaughter had gotten one if these. She seems to like it better than any of the others we had tried. Of course we only had one. I found these on line. ordered them and they were delivered within 3-4 days. Service through amazon is always spectacular !!!
very good
My son loves his wubanubs!  The cow is especially awesome because it lays flat and has just enough weight to it.
Very prompt shipping. Excellent product!
"My sons LOVED and LOVE these, and have since birth.  Ingenious idea and highly recommend!  My 15 month old uses at bedtime for both his pacifier and his &#34;lovie&#34;"
This was the only pacifier my son could hold in his mouth while he was a newborn.  It really saved my life that the pacifier held itself in his mouth.
My son couldn't tell the difference between the original MAM and the perfect MAM.
My son loves his bull!  The pacifier is well attached which is good as this thing goes with us everywhere everyday. We call it his best friend and joke that he's going to take it to college with him!  Love the wubbanub!
"I got the brown puppy Wubbanub at a store while we were doing our 4D ultrasound months ago and after how much baby loved it, I ordered three more!  Thank goodness I did because our real puppy decided that he wanted the original one as his chew toy. :/  Our baby although only a newborn likes to hold on to these and I love how they lay on her chest perfectly so you don't have to keep fixing it when it falls out.  She loves staring at them even when she's not sucking on them and likes to hold one of the arms as she falls asleep for a nap.  I am so thrilled with these that I suggest them to all my mommy friends."
"My son's only &#34;lovey.&#34; Great quality, super cute. Just wish there was a way to remove the pacifier without cutting it off. We are eventually going to need to wean our son from the pacifier part, but would still like to keep the monkey around since it's his security item."
"These are on our top-ten list for &#34;baby-must-haves&#34;. Absolutely love every aspect of them, the guilt free components (environmentally/baby safe), the easy to clean factor, and now that baby is older - the fact that this can be a strap on (with paci clip) paci and teether in one! So convenient and quality."
my son is very like. i like he can often use. my son and i are like this cartoon characters are very.
i've had this for 2 months now and so far i can see my son from the screen and sleep without worrying about his safety. we switched from the summer infant monitor and i'm very glad we got this this. quality is great in day and night conditions and i would recommend this. we bought the wide angle lens and will likely be using it when he grows older.
"bought to fit in a 58 year old crib, not the best fit but works well.  seem tone made of good materials."
"bathing your baby is not the easiest task, especially if you are first time parents, you get nervous, and things might become really chaotic in seconds!<br /><br />this tiny duck does exactly what it is supposed to, in seconds. the color coding is amazing, and you know you are good to go if you just see the green light, cool down a bit if it's red, and add some hot water if you see the blue.and it's made out of really solid material, doesn't feel cheap as some other plastic things you find in stores these days.<br /><br />all in all, it's a very good product."
purchased for my newborn photo shoots and they are perfect. someone recommended them to me and i'm glad i purchased them.
"fred is a great toy! when ever he is touched, he starts moving forward and barking/whining. my munchkin loves to follow him around!"
"i tell you, this product is better than an internal oven lock! because, i am able to leave it in the lock position while i cook!<br />which allows me to do other things around the house and not have to be subject to hovering over the stove for 40 minutes and saving the huge headache of constantly telling my son to &#34;get away from the stove, it's hot!&#34;<br /><br />oh and to top it off, it's very easy to use.<br /><br />however, there is a negative. i have a dual oven. the top oven is smaller (1 rack) than the bottom oven (3 racks). the lock will only fit the top one, and not the bottom door. fortunately, we are a small family of 4 and only need to use the top oven.<br />so, it works for my family.<br /><br />i would recommend this product. i absolutely love it."
great high chair......on to the second grandchild.
"I'm glad I chose the Mam pacifiers. Of course, every baby has a different preference on the shape. My baby is now 9 months old and still happily uses the 0-6 months pacifier. One of the best things about the pacifiers is the little plastic case they come in; the case is used to sanitize the pacifiers in the microwave. You fill with water to a line and microwave for three minutes. I sanitize the pacifiers every night while I'm doing things around the kitchen. In nine months I have not seen any buildup or mold on the inside of the pacifiers. I know other pacifiers have issues with buildup, so I feel like I made a good buying decision!"
I used these for both of my babies. They are the best! No more searching for a pacifier at night!
very nice product
"Got this for my 4 month old son, he loves pacis, and I love monkeys for him. This was perfect. I do suggest washing it before using because it was a bit dusty. Which is understandable."
Love it! My little boy takes it everywhere and the stuffed animal gives him something to play with! Recommend for sure
"I was down to two pacifiers that my son hadn't chewed up yet, found this to be the best deal. Got here supper fast (upgraded prime to one day shipping for just a few dollars, cheaper than a gallon of gas to get to the store). And my son loves them!"
"We actually got two wubbanub's as gifts and ended up purchasing another because they are so great! All wubbanub animals aren't equal. The turtle is great for when your little one is lying/sitting fairly still since it can lay flat on their chest.  We also have an elephant and a giraffe.  We have the elephant in the crib since you can make it 'stand' for when she lies onber side, makeing it the perfect height (upside down worked best when very small). The giraffe as you would imagine has a long skinny neck so it flops around more. Great for when they can wrap their arms or hands around it to hold it in, but bad when they move their head alot as it tends to get flung or stuck under their head."
The color and design is great comes in handy for a crying baby and was made with good quality. Will for sure purchase again
"We weren't going to do the whole pacifier thing with our breastfed baby, but the hospital photographer showed us how well these Soothies worked and it was hard to argue with results. Our little one found suckling to be very soothing, but we soon found out she'd scream and squawk whenever she tossed the pacifier out of her mouth.<br /><br />The Wubbanub:<br /><br />1. Made her less likely to toss the pacifier onto the floor.<br />2. Protected the pacifier from actually touching the floor when she did throw it out.<br />3. Gave her a cute stuffed animal to touch, hold, and hug.<br /><br />I buy Wubbanubs for shower gifts for all my friends and family now."
Its cute and I hope that it will work for the new baby in August. The babys room is baby jungle animals

This one is much cuter and better quality than the one like it that is sold at Babies R Us!
"I bought this when my son was a couple weeks old because he favored soothie pacifiers and I loved the idea of being able to more easily find the pacifier, having something my son could hold onto, and having something that sort of propped up the pacifier while he was too young to keep it in his mouth well enough on his own.<br /><br />This has met all those expectations wonderfully! I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine. In between washes in the washing machine I wash only the pacifier part and it's not too difficult. Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly.<br /><br />I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep.<br />I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons!<br /><br />One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy! I can imagine him loving this for a long time, long after outgrowing pacifiers.<br /><br />Best purchase. I don't know how I would have made it through the infant months without these!!!"
"My baby loves these pacifiers, she used them since birth and is already a year old. Excellent quality and price"
"My new grandson loves these pacifiers! He could not keep a paci in his mouth until we got these, he holds onto the animal and it holds it in! Of course he is only 3 weeks old!"
"Let me start off by saying that Wubbanubs are the best thing since sliced bread!!  They may be a little bit more expensive than your average binky but your sanity, especially in the early days, is priceless.  With that said we are wubbanub addicts in our house.  My son has more than 10 and I will probably buy more (we like to match his binky with his outfit).  'God Bless Plush Lamb' wubbanub is one of the better ones out of the bunch but mine arrived with some stitching and cosmetic defects (I'm hoping this is an isolated issue as we've had no trouble with our other wubbanubs so I'm not deducting from the rating).  I like the way it lays and also the weight, and who doesn't love the sweet innocence of this wubbanub?!  Absolutely precious!  One of my favorites."
My newborn needed a pacifier that was a little larger than normal to keep in her mouth and these worked great. Cheaper than the store too!
"This is a must have! We bought a bunch of different pacifiers but the bebe would only take the Soothie that she was given at the hospital. However, she was not able to keep it in her mouth so she kept losing it (and screaming). I was going insane! Then my saviour arriveD - the WubbaNub! Bebe loves it and I love it. Finally, I don't have to give her the paci every 5 seconds. It helps the baby keep the pacifier in her mouth and it's easy to find when it does fall out. The stuffed animal is adorable. It's our bebe's first friend. She absolutely loves it. I just wish I found out about it sooner (it was a looooonnnng couple of weeks without the WubbNub).<br /><br />We have the giraffe and the duck. The duck is cuter but the giraffe works better, in my opinion. It's a little bigger, so it's easier for the baby to hold and it does a better job at keeping the paci in baby's mouth.<br /><br />No matter which stuffed animal you pick, make sure you buy two WubbaNubs because when you have to wash it, it takes a while to dry. I've learned it the hard way!"
"I have bought these for all three of my boys. I liked that the nipple is similar to a real one which I felt helped with breast feeding. As the kids get older this was the one pacifier they could find on their own in the crib which meant more sleep for me. Depending on the child, and their teething, the pacifier end would last about 6 months. As for cleaning I would run the nipple under the sink with soap or put it in the washing machine with my other clothes and let air dry for a really good cleaning. When the kids are at the pint of giving up the pacifier (down to naps only) I cut off the nipple end and let them hold on to the toy. In a day or two they are done with pacifiers with little fuss."
Baby is not born yet ...so I do not have a great review on that . But I like the texture and shape<br />Thx
"Nuk bottles and pacifiers are the ONLY brand my daughter likes. Easy to clean, I highly recommend trying them. Of course, the designs are cute."
My grandson won't sleep without his WubbaNubs. So Grandma purchased one for at her house and now he goes right to bed. The stuff animal makes it easy to find and it gives babies something to hold on to.
"Only one of my twins will take a pacifier & this is the only brand she'll use, the animals attached is just a great bonus. She is able to find it if it drops out of her mouth now that she's old enough, but prior to that when she was still little the animal helped us wedge it under her swaddle so it wouldn't fall out (she is one of those babies who will scream bloody murder if she doesn't have it, lol). It has helped her establish her hand eye coordination very quickly as well. We have 5 of these things, they are a definite must have in our house!"
Love them and the baby loves them too.  What more can you say about Rockies pacifiers.  Go Go Rockies !!
"My daughter developed a 'binky' rash for many months.  I switched her to these and it went away within a week.  Water seldomly gets in the nipple, i clean it well and replace them as is recommended with pacifiers.  These really are the best!"
its good one  and i like it too much
"If your baby started using one of these pacifiers as a newborn, it can be hard to switch over to other pacifiers once they have learned a preference.  This was the case in my baby.  She only liked her pacifier from the hospital.  I was happy to find the same hospital recommended brand online.  The 2 pack gives you a spare for the diaper bag which is really convenient."
High quality bottles and pacifiers as always! These are the only ones my daughter will take. This package is a great value.<br /><br />P.S. These bottles do leak if shaken because of the venting system on the bottom.
My baby loves these...She was never a fan of the Avent which I bought for her at first. She cannot put down these pacifiers. They are too cute.
My daughter loooooves this giraffe paci :) she doesn't sleep without it. Very quick shipping and is exactly what the pictures shows. Thank you!
So cute and love the colors.  Can not wait for my baby girl to use this!  Wish I would have ordered the one for my son on Amazon instead of the 3 basic options they BRU has.
My 16 month old loves this paci. He has been using it since birth. He refuses any other one....it's a shame these are not made in bigger sizes! It is easy to wash. I love that it only has one piece and as such there is no risk of parts detaching.
"Our little one loves his wannanub.  I was a gift and I ordered a second one to have in case we lost the first one.  I tried the elephant, but he likes the frog a lot more.  He likes to chew on the legs and feet!"
My son is 11 months old and still uses this pacifier exclusively (even though it's a newborn size).  It was great when he was younger because it was easy for him to hold onto.  I've been giving it as gifts to other pregnant moms.  Makes a cute gift!
love that I could find a bundle on for the price I have an autistic 3 1/2 yr old daughter who hates chewy tubes and loves to bite these pacifiers.
"I knew as soon as my friend announced she was having a baby, that I HAD to get these for her, and delivery of the item was SUPER fast. Thank you!!!"
love these pacifiers as they are nuk and are hello kitty and priced comparably to CVS (except I can't get these at my CVS).
This is my sons absolute favorite pacifier and mine too... Easy to locate in the dark in the middle of the night and extremely stylish and cute
My daughter loves the wubbanub... The stuffed animal helps it stay in there month when they are first born and now that she is 4 months hold she holds on to it and plays with it. You should 100% get one
"My older son always used Nuk pacifiers, and our baby only likes these. Each was/is totally devoted to their pacis. Having experience with both types, I prefer this kind. Here's why:<br /><br />These are all one piece. The Nuk's would get a little bit of water inside of the nipple when washed/boiled, and over time would get cloudy and gross inside, and little bits of dust/grime would get stuck in the seam between the hard plastic shell and the nipple. These get totally clean and there are no seams or areas for water or grime to collect.<br /><br />These are all the same semi-soft material. Our baby will chew on the edges to help with teething, and if he face-plants while sucking/chewing (which happened a LOT while learning to crawl) there are no hard areas to hurt him. Landing on the edge of a Nuk can hurt a little.<br /><br />The only annoying thing is that these bounce like crazy when dropped. We have hardwood floors through most of the house and they can easily end up 10 feet away if dropped from adult height while holding baby. We probably have one under most pieces of furniture at our house at any given time. So just accept this and buy a bunch so you have backups. On the plus side, my 3-year-old thinks it is fun to go on a &#34;pacifier hunt&#34; and see how many he can find while slithering under furniture."
Very cute and durable. Great for infants at night because they are easy to find. My daughter is almost a year old and still loves hers.
"My son absolutely LOVES his monkey pullypalz.  At this point, it's not so much about pacifier access as entertainment - he loves just pulling on the pacifiers and seeing what happens.  It's fabulous when we're stuck in traffic and he's getting bored.  Highly recommend this!"
My son loves this even before he could grab his binki he liked looking at the cow and keeps his binki from getting lost under his bottom
Great product! this product will save you lots of money. You will be able to keep up with pacifiers . I highly recommend.
"I feel like a horrible mother since I have not gotten my 3 year old to get rid of these things yet (she went from taking it all the time to just pacifying herself to sleep which is an improvement). However, I love that the nipple mimics the nipple for most bottles, it also helped my baby with colic when she was younger."
We tried a bunch of different pacifiers and these worked the best for our baby - he could keep them in his mouth a lot easier then the others we had. These are very lightweight and a good size especially for newborns.
This is the perfect size for little hands. My kids never really cared for pacifiers but bought this for car rides and she loved it. This one is so soft. Easily washed and dried with no problems. A cute shower gift.
I now have the classiest baby on the block!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. If only so you can know what your baby will look like as a classy adult.
"We LOVE this!!!! Only animal we have found that holds pacifier on 100% of time but pacifier can be removed easily for cleaning, also easy to find when tossed aross car/room by our little one! Highly recommend! We are going to order another one as a back up. Bear gets softer with every washing."
"Since my grandson will eventually be using the Advent bottles, I purchased the advent pacifiers. Love the fact you are able to put your finger  in the pacifier's center so the baby can suck on your finger."
I now have the classiest baby on the block!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. If only so you can know what your baby will look like as a classy adult.
My baby wouldn't take any other pacifier but this one. I guess because of the shape. It was perfect. I got my first one from a friend and she said it was the only one that her baby took right away too.
My son has the turtle and monkey. He loves them both. He longer cares for the pacifier but he still holds onto them to take naps :)
My sister in law loved it! I got it for the little guy who's about to come out of the oven.
"I gave this a good rating but I really don't know. It was a gift for a friend and the baby passed away. Didn't even get to use it. You never ask for a gift back, that's rude. So it was donated."
I am delighted because it is an excellent product. Love the color and quality MAM! I indicate the product! Thanks!
I'm in love with this passifier.  My son likes this one a lot but the monkey is his favorite.  It is great from birth through 6 months or older.  It helps him keep it in place.  He is even learning to put back in his mouth himself.
"perfect, simple, gender neutral, pacifier. Although our little guy never really got hooked on the binki we like these, they come wih a nice little cover too"
My granddaughter would not take a pacifier but she liked the wubbanub and enjoyed chewing on it too. I have purchased them for baby gifts for friends too. You can't misplace it like a regular pacifier.
This was the only passi by baby would take! Love it. It's easy for them to put in and good for a 12 month plus age! Nice and durable as well
"These are so cute, they glow in the dark and work so well. Easy to clean and spot when you are desperate to find!"
I've ordered a few of these plush toy pacifiers and the giraffe is definitely my baby's favorite (she likes touching the &#34;horns&#34;). It is very cute.
"he will take no other pacifier, I have tried he goes right to sleep with these in, they are great."
Big  LSU fans so was VERY please to find a tiger wubbanub for friend of mine having her baby in August. She was Thrilled! Great purchase!
I bought this for my 2 month old who hated being in his car seat and in the back seat by himself. What a Life Saver!!!<br />I don't have to play...Where is the binky game?! and now my son loves staring and talking stories to his monkey friend. I totally adore it and no more car rides with an upset baby! It has made my car rides a lot easier and so pleasant. I plan on getting the Frog for his bouncer...Its an Awesome product...Get it...You won't regret it!
I agree with item. The item is accord with my spectates. Thank you for all. I glad with it. The item size is correct.
"My baby boy loves it,it is so cute and soft.he is playing with it and it is easy to find it"
We bought this Wubbanub as a backup to another Dino Wubbie. It is the only pacifier that our baby looks for! He is definitely attached and Mama loves that it doesn't get lost easily!
Holds two nuk pacifiers at a time. Great for keeping them clean and safe! I have green and love the color :)
She pets his ears and pulls his face to hers when she is sleepy. She can easily find it at night and his ears helps her know which end to insert. ;)
"Great pacifier, my new born loved it and this was the only one that worked. After 8 months we no longer needed anything."
My little one loves this pacifier. I also like how the pacifier comes with its own case to help keep it clean. Plus I love the unique skull. Shipping was prompt.
"it's everything i wanted in a wet bag: light to carry, easy to open, easy to clean, and keeps the odor in."
"These are a life-saver! When a tired parent stumbles into the nursery to find the lost pacifier for a crying baby, these glow-in-the-dark pacifiers come in handy!! Just look for the green orb and there you have it! I purchased these for a baby gift, I use the larger size ones for my own little ones. Definitely a must-have for new parents!"
"I love the Wubbanubs!  I have a 10 month old boy who has a couple of these and when I found out I'll be having a girl soon, I made sure I had a wubbanub that would be just hers.  My son doesn't even use pacifiers that often anymore but when he did, he loved holding onto the animal and at night (the only time he really still uses it), it makes it so much easier to find it in the crib if he wakes up and needs it."
"THESE ARE GREAT, THESE WERE NOT IN THE STORES WHEN I HAD MY CHILDREN. I AM SORTA A GERM-A-FOBE AND I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND IT IS ALWAYS IN USE THIS LIL THINGAMABOB STOPS YOUR BABY FROM GETTING GERMS OR VIRUSES OR INFECTIONS. I LOVE THIS PACI CRADLE AND MY DAUGHTER DOES TOO, THE ONLY TIME THAT IT IS NOT INUSE IS WHEN THE BABY IS SLEEP OR FEEDING. THANX AMAZON."
My daughter loves hers! She will not sleep without or take a regular soothie anymore. I had to order a few more for back up
I love the dog and all the other critters that I have ordered. Will order lots more for the grand kids.
"The WubbaNub does the job of helping the pacifier stay put but its not a magic charm or anything.  Five stars because the animal part makes it easier to find the pacifier in the diaper bag!<br /><br />It was smaller than I thought. The quality so far is good, its held up fine in the washing machine and dries quickly (on the drying rack). The white worried me a little but it doesn't seem to be a dirt magnet.  All the stitching is very sturdy.  The WubbaNub looks like it will stand up to a lot of use.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it would be fairly easy to swap out another style of pacifier if that is what your baby likes. About as complex as sewing on a button.<br /><br />Since I don't want to encourage the pacifier &#34;habit&#34;, I see removing the pacifier part down the road and keeping the lamb as a lovie type of cuddle toy."
Our 6 month old loves her paci. WubbaNub is the only one this child will take! It is super easy for her to find at night when it is dark. It is the only one she will fall asleep with. I have tried many different kinds including the Smoothie by it's self and she wants nothing to do with any of them!
None available.
"I so wish our baby would take one of the cute pacifiers out there, but after trying dozens this was the only one he would take! Thankful we found a binary he lives, but wish it wasn't so obnoxious looking!"
My daughter is really enjoying these pacifiers.  They stay in her mouth better than others we've tried and they do not leave impressions like others do.
"Our daughter is two months old and has been using these pacifiers since the first few weeks of life. Unlike other pacifiers that we have bought (soothers, etc), the outside of these pacifiers are not heavy and fit well against the newborn/infants face and mouth, therefore they don't fall out as easily when they stop sucking. Also, the holes along the edges make it easy to attach to a pacifier clip and attach to a seat or the babies clothing. A must for new babies!"
"These pacifiers are SO cute!  And I love how they are made, very durable.  I think I've found a new favorite for my little man."
great pacifier and toy for my baby who enjoys playing with her pacifier. keeps her calm and quiet. had one previous and had to get more.
BPA free plastics and nice shape for the development of your child's mouth. Highly suggest you get an 8 pack so you always have one around for a teething kid! Good luck and carry on!
"We first got a pack of these from the hospital when we had our daughter. We soon learned when we got home that, in addition to the sock monster, we have a pacifier monster that lives at our house, too,  because these things kept disappearing. We were unable to find these anywhere in the remote area where we live so I purchased these online. They're a great bargain and the pink and purple are adorable since we have a little girl and these also stand up just fine in the sterilizing process. Highly recommend purchasing these and a pacifier clip- if your child uses a pacifier a pacifier clip is a must have unless you want to constantly be searching for one or washing it because it fell on the floor! Definitely makes life easier to have a clip and an extra pack of these around, just in case."
I love these pacifiers my daugher loves them. I love the fact that they are one piece and they are made from natural rubber.
My baby loves this pacifier. The giraffe makes it easy for her to hold on to it and keeps it from falling out of her mouth. It also doubles as a toy.
great pacifier for our baby to soothe baby. no other pacifier work as great as this one for us.  She can played with the stuffed animal as well. wish i had this for my first baby.
We got this WubbaNub as a gift for a friend who recently had a baby.  We used a couple of WubbaNub when my son was younger.  He loved them.  As your baby gets older he will be able to find it easily in his crib to comfort himself at night.
"My baby sleeps with those, and sometimes it becomes a habit that he will not go to sleep without those. You don't want your babies to rely on those too much, but at the same time this will save you all the hassle or comforting them and trying to put them to sleep."
great gift for baby it was hilarious can't wait to see pics of the little guy with this goof for a laugh
My daughter love it! I recommend! This is the only pacifier she likes! I pretend buy another like this in the future!
"So far, I've tried to give soothie, nuk, and gumdrop pacifiers to my daughter.  My daughter loves the gumdrop pacifier and I like that it does not cover or rub against her nose like the soothie or leave marks on her cheeks like the nuk.  We received the gumdrop pacifier at the hospital and I just ordered 4 more!  Update: Still a huge fan of these and we continued buying through the various stages. When we were given other pacifiers as gifts, we would try them, but never switched brands. My daughter has always preferred the GumDrop pacifiers and still does today. Now it's time to start weaning off of the pacifier!"
"My daughter wouldn't  take any other pacifier, so after some research I found the Wubbanub! She loves the nipple shape and although shes still too young to really hold the monkey, having it there keeps it in her mouth better."
i use this product for items that need to be transferred to different vehicles.  easy to move and sturdy enough to do the job.
imho absolutely best pacifiers out there.  my baby loved these from day 1 and we tried many different brands. i've already bought the next size up.
"these plug covers are nicely designed there is enough covers for two homes.  the covers are easy to install, and my grand child can not pull them out.  i feel a lot better now that i have installed these plug covers."
my only complaint with this is that its not 2ftx1ft.  its small and fits on the counter great and helps dry all of the different parts of a pump and bottle set.
"we don't have any diaper genies and only use these baggies at home. i bought them as a temporary solution before i did more research on diaper genies. these are scented, easy to get out of a box, and easy to tie to stop smell from escaping. all i know is that baby's poop smells and keeping poopy diapers in a diaper genie for days in a room where my kid and we sleep....is gross. i throw these out a few times a day! very easy and hygienic!"
"It's of very good quality. We like that it has raised sections on all for corners, not just on the sides."
Our four month loves his Wubanub's. They give him the independence to control when he wants his pacifier. Easy to locate because of the attached toy.
Babies need to suck to soothe themselves. The hospital gave us one of these and told us pacifiers also can prevent SIDS. Our baby loves this pacifier and we have given it to him since day one. I am breastfeeding and he has not had any nipple confusion. Make sure you have enough before you get home!
Love these Bink's! I really like that the handle lies flat so my daughter doesn't plat with it when I lay her down to sleep. This bundle is cheaper than buying a two pack at our grocery store. She only uses them for sleep but I think they look nicer in her mouth like they fit around the nose better.
"I really like these pacifiers! I always wondered how she'd breath when she had a stuffy nose, so I had to give these a try! They work great and are cute!"
The animal on the end is not only cute but helps the pacifier stay in place.  It also makes it easier for your child to grab when it falls out of his/her mouth.  The animal does not detach but I have thrown mine in the laundry quite a few times and it has held up well.
"We received a frog version of this pacifier for my son's baby shower and he loved it so much that I purchased this puppy for a friend's baby shower. I bought the puppy version for my son as well. He rotates between the frog, puppy and now a WubbaNub monkey.  I like that it is much easier to find and keep track of than other pacifiers. I can find it in the dark in his crib. It is easy for the baby to hold on to as well. As he's grown older, my son alternates using it as a pacifier and a stuffed animal for cuddling. When he's too old for pacifiers, I might cut the pacifier off and he can continue to have his little friend with him!"
"I tried several different brands of pacifiers (MAM, Avent, Nuk, and the hospital one) but my baby would either gag or spit them right out. Finally I tried these, since I am a fan of Dr. Browns bottles, and she took it right away and has been using it ever since.     These pacifiers have what's called an orthodontic nipple (more flat at the tip) which is supposed to be closer to what babies experience breastfeeding. Also, these are made in the USA so I felt more comfortable with the quality."
"My baby loved it. Now as a toddler she still loves it. It is hard to lose, easy to hang onto and a toy and a binky in one. It is well put together and has never cracked or frayed. You can just toss it in the washer and let it air dry."
My daughter loves this! We call it her &#34;best friend&#34; would recommend as a much buy for any young child.
perfect for my three year old. They even glow in the dark which my daughter absolutely just loved it! Good Buy!
"My baby girl - aged 15 months -- loved these!! I feel more comfortable knowing they are pure rubber, and they are easy to sanitize and clean.  She bites little holes in them after about 5 weeks, but that's a decent lifespan."
This is the 2nd Wubbanub we have purchased for our son. They are so cute! This one is by far the cutest. They don't help the pacifier stay put as well as I hoped (I expected it to be a little heavier) but it is easier to grab when he spits it out in the car seat or at night when it's dark.
"The only ones I can find easily during those 3 am &#34;Binky emergencies&#34; on the table, floor or wherever it may have fallen. Actually helped my daughter find it herself to make her more independent and sleep through the night as well!"
"These are great in the stroller or car bc you can slip them under a harness and much easier for baby to hold, since we don't attach our pacifiers.  I just wash it off and try to keep the toy part dry, or use a toy wipe."
"I bought this one for a baby gift but we have had several in our household. It is great for newborns, just lay it on the baby's chest and if it slips out of her mouth, the pacifier is right there and often the baby can root for it and get it back without an adult looking all over the place for it! The animals are cute and washable. Fantastic invention!"
This is a Great gift for a new baby. Our grand daughters had several &#34;Wubby's&#34; and loved them til they wore out! They are much easier to keep track of than a plain pacifier!
"like all avent products, I found an excellent product, can not speak to their quality as I am not the one who uses them, but I think my daughter is happy to use them"
"I tried so many different pacifiers.. something about these make our little girl like them better than the others.  She feeds with a nipple shield, so that probably means that she gravitates towards different shapes than other babies."
"Bought this for a good friend having a baby- delivery fast and very cute. She loved it, can't wait to see pictures of him w/ it."
We get so many comments on this from people just passing by.  His first bday party is going to be a mustache bash now that he's known as the mustache baby.  Love it.
Our baby loves the vanilla flavor pacifiers! For whatever reason these are his favorite type/ brand. Good product and I would recommend it
These temp pacifiers are great!! Easy to read and are accurate.. A easy way to get that temp when your baby doesn't feel good.. Great quality.. Highly reccommend :)
I bought it for my brand new nephew and he has never looked more hilarious. I want an extra pair for myself lol
This is such a great pacifier!  My son can easily hold it in his mouth and can grab it in case he loses it!
"So soft, and latex free pacifier. Any baby will love this in a carseat so they can hold it. Buy more than one and a different animal for each baby for multiples!"
"Great small nipple for his tiny mouth. We tried a few different kinds of pacifiers, and these worked the best for our little man. The little handle on them also make it easier for him to grasp on to."
"Pacifiers are pretty subjective, but I absolutely love two things about these: (1) The little &#34;handles&#34; make them very easy to pick up, and (2) you can actually see cute little smiles through the cut-outs!  O"
"I used MAM bottles for both of my children.  I haven't seen them lately in stores though.  When my cousin asked me my opinion about different bottles for her new baby I immediately recommended these.  Since we couldn't find them in stores, I ordered them here.  Free 2 day shipping, and my new baby cousin is loving these bottles.  Score!"
We three types of pacifiers for our new baby girl and started introducing them to her when she was about 4 weeks old.  The Soothies are by far her favorite.  We also tried some of the Nuk which she is sort of okay with and another Avent which she spits out every time.  We have now bought multiple packages of the Soothies and we're all very happy with them.
"with a 4 year old and a 2 year old we have been been through 5 carriers, for various reasons. this one is the best so far. we love that it has such a high weight limit. and love that it is so easy to get on and off. the kids just hop on my back and i pull the straps over them and latch -- super easy. we had initially purchased the onya outback and found the fabric too rough on my shoulders. the cruiser is much smoother. i was worried the fabric would be too warm, but that has not been a problem. i'll try to remember to update this in july/aug after we use it when it is really hot and humid outside!"
"love this stroller! best thing for my two boys! my oldest is 3, youngest is 10 months and it couldnt be more perfect! pleasantly surprised with every detail!"
"love this mattress!  most crib mattresses are hard as bricks. this one is firm enough to meet the guidelines for infant development, yet somehow still nice and soft. the memory foam compresses just enough on the surface.  seems like great quality as well. note- this item arrives rolled up in a box that seems impossibly small.  fear not- the mattress is compressed for shipping and will quickly &#34;puff up&#34; to normal size.  it did not have any foul odor upon opening."
"this changing table is great, perfect height (even for my husband who is 6'6&#34;) and it looks really nice in the baby's nursery. we bought the matching crib and it's a great set. basic, no frills, but good looking and sturdy. very easy to assemble, too. very happy with it."
"my child has had wubbanubs since he was in the nicu. he's 4 now, almost 5, i purchased this product a couple of years ago as a replacement. once he turned 3 was easy to break him of using a binky since he got to keep &#34;dog&#34;. dog just doesn't have a pacifier on his face now. even now dog is his favorite stuffed animal. that's why i recommend these, they have a use after outliving their original purpose."
"i had gone to visit my brother and sister-in-law once, i spent over an hour attempting to open a cabinet.  determined not to suffer that same embarrassment in my own home, i sought out products that were easy for adults but impossible for children.  this is  a great product."
this is a comfy blanket and sheet set and the reversibility allows my 3 year old son to decide which superhero he wants to have each night.  very good item.
this is the perfect size for little hands. the baby loves to grasp it and shake it. great colors that keep baby interested.
my daughters favorite blanket. i had to buy a second one as back up since it snags pretty easily but it's a great little princess blanket.
"blocks were just what my daughter wanted for her baby girl. so, as grandfather i had to get them.<br />they arrived on time and were exactly what we were looking for."
excelent  i love this product for my recently baby thaks a lot a will buy a more product like this
"i love the set.  the colors are bright and pictures fun, and the spoon and fork are perfect for a toddler's hands."
His parents and I all loved this little cross with the Guardian Angel on the top.  I know it will be something he cherishes all his life.
Adorable stuffed animal pacifiers. My newborn grandson received quite a few trendy pacy's as gifts but this is the only one he will use.  Might be the little animal he can hold on to...I don't know...but had to buy several more as back-ups since he won't use any other kind.
"I love this pod, it is the Perfect size, easy to clean and beautiful print. 1-2 pacifiers fit perfectly. I recommend it !"
I could not find monkey's in any store so they were great ! I can't wait to buy the green set next with clowns on them.
Still waiting to actually use the one for my daughter. The other two were a huge hit at the baby showers I attended.
"I not only love MAM pacifiers in general, but the glow in the dark are wonderful! At night my son sleeps in his pack n play next to my side of the bed. If he wakes up and is upset I can actually see his pacifier in the dark to give it back to him. Which sometimes is all he needs and will go right back to sleep. No more searching in the dark for it!"
"These are great, same quality as the NUK binkies we've been using since she was a few weeks old.  Finally time to throw away the old ones, that are suitable for 6 months and younger.  The NUKS hold up well and she loves them. She'll spit out a Soothie or Avent and look for the NUK.  The only drawback is that hair can get caught between the plastic and silicon, but I just run my fingernail around it when cleaning to get the hair out.  My kid loves these.  That's good enough for us."
"This is such a sweet gift. It's perfect for a newborn baby and does help hold the pacifier, that newborns often easily spit out. It really is a darling gift."
We love our wubs.  I have bought almost all the animals I think.  These are the greatest if you are down with pacis
I had bought these for my cousin's baby shower and they are so cute. I will be ordering another set since I just found out that I am going to be a grandma and the saying's are so so true
"My baby loves this thing! not sure if is a good thing, but he totally loves it! makes a perfect gift as well."
My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this!! She likes to try to hold onto thing while she's sleeping and this is perfect!! I will definitely buy more and will also buy them as gifts!!
"The Baby loves his Wubbanub!! So easy to handle, and great for Mom to keep up with.. A Must Have!"
"We have 3 of these. My only complaint is that the bunny's string on its mouth came untied.<br /><br />They're not hard to wash. Just annoying. I use a little liquid hand soap, do a light scrubbing, rinse, wring out, roll it up and twist in a wash cloth and then let dry over the side of my dish draining rack. It can take up to a day for that.<br />They're easier to find in a car, at night, more noticed when dropped. Easier for baby to find it. My little girl loves to hold the ears. If they weren't $12+, we'd have more than 3."
We were constantly replacing lost pacifiers. We have never lost a Wubbanub! These are especially nice  because the little bit of added weight from the animal helps keep the pacifier from popping out of the baby's mouth so easily. We have had many of the different animal thru several different grand kids. We always just tossed them in a lingerie bag into the washer when they needed cleaning. Theses are always a hit at baby showers and my definite go to when buying a baby gifts!
"we got this about 6 months ago after talking with friends who use the wubbanub.  my toddler loves the Nuk pacifiers.  She would lose her pacifier during the night and it would fall on the floor and of course she would be mad.  as she got older and could control things more on her own, we thought this would be a great idea.  we call him &#34;Paci Bear&#34;.  He stays in my little ones crib.  If she loses her paci in the night, paci bear saves her, and us from getting woken up."
"I preparied for my baby, who wil be born in Aug, and havn't use it. I think she will love it."
Use them constantly and the baby loves them. Don't go for the less expensive pacifiers! These are worth the price and I'm glad we purchased them.
"I wanted something cute, (and not girly,) for my son. Even though he isn't a huge paci fan, this gives him something to hold and play with. The bull looks exactly as pictured, and washes well. It is very lightweight and small, making it perfect for baby's hands."
"The hospital where my grandson was born used these vanilla scene newborn pacifiers.  I know from prior readings that vanilla is a favorite scent of men.  So when he needed more I didn't hesitate to order this specific pacifier.  He liked it, it soothed him.  I guess there's something about the vanilla that works."
"Good price. My daughter is exclusively breast fed. She won't take any bottles and it took me forever to find a soother she would take. These are the winner, and I am glad they aren't expensive."
"I probably paid way too much for this wubbanub, but I thought it would be so cute for my little boy - and I was right! The dragon is my favorite of all of his wubbanubs. It looks like the picture, except the wings are actually more blue than purple. (I like blue better, anyway.)"
i need it .because useful.Want a discount.i will buy it once more.i love my baby and happy birthday for you!
"These are impossible to find in stores and by far the best binkys ever, as they are 1 piece and very durable,  no worries of it coming apart and choking baby,  but of course you still have to Replace it every so often just not as often as your regular binky, easier to stay in mouth as it's not that slippery material other brands use (not to mention any brands) i have used these on all my 4 kids and now my granddaughter.  This price is great and you get a spare. Shipping was right on time,  will continue buying them here"
My daughter loves these and wont take any other pacifier. They are easy for her to hold. She's been using these pacifiers since birth and she's almost 5 months old.
"What's not to love? A nuk, the brand most hospitals use - plus a cute dog? it's great for a child to grow with.  when you are ready to have them be done with the nuk, you simply cut it off!"
"When I saw this online, I desperately wanted to get it for my NB son.  I waited to be sure he would take to the Soothie pacifier on his current WubbaNub before spending the money on this one (since it's quite a bit more expensive than most WubbaNubs).  He took to it so we ordered this little guy.  It is absolutely adorable!!  Even cuter than the picture.<br />Now to get it cleaned up so we can start using it.  :)"
Who doesn't love these? They help a lot with nursing babies. They latch on much easier and laid back suck.
"We  have a large family with lots of grandkids and their associated messes. When the baby starts to get fussy, this is so much easier to locate and it stays in juniors mouth better with the extra paws holding on."
"My son LOVES his Mustache and cries when he can't have it! Not to mention it's super cute! Grandparents, it is a must have for your new grandsons."
i like because is beauty and is original design.<br />it is comfort and the two pacifiers help my little baby
These are the type of pacifiers that my daughter likes and I thought the writing was funny.  I did see these for very cheap at Target a week or so after I bought them here but I'm still happy with them.
"Bought these for my baby girl that is on the way.  Look to be of good quality.  Again, GO Bears!"
"We e tried a lot of pacifiers, and this became a fast favorite. We now have two, in case one goes missing."
"You can't have too many of these. If your baby likes the Nuk shape, these are a great buy. We have them stashed in strategic places around the house and at grandma's, too."
"You can sterilize this bottle without a sterilizer, it's really easy to clean, the pacifiers are cute, the price is good."
I bought these for a friend that was decorating her nursery in a John Deere themed room. When she saw them she thought they were the cutest things ever for a baby and kept wondering how I ever found them and I told her that I had my sources. haha.
"Complete life saver. I have 3 of these and they are the BEST EVER. They stay on the childs chest when they are too young to hold it, and when they are older, they themselves can reach for it and put it in their mouths. My daughter, now 2 1/2 still loves her but the binky part has long fallen off. She now just holds the caterpillar as a stuffed animal for both her nap and bed time. Im pregnant with my second, and will be buying more ASAP."
"My baby has a cleft lip and this is the only pacifier she likes to use. It stays in her mouth the best. Plus, she likes to hold on to her lamb."
Easy to keep up with and just adorable.  Every baby needs at least one! I will purchase again for gifts
"my grandson loves it, it is great and he will not loss it, I will recomend it to every mom"
"I purchased these from the Amazon baby registry. The Mom said they were better than described, especially the  quality and workmanship. We will purchase from this seller again. We are expecting twins, so it's double the cost, and the cost of these is perfect."
"My little guy is not here yet, he is due in Aug.. But I caint wait to use them then! they are super cute! And I have read a lot of good reviews about them that's why I bought them :)"
"Hilarious! We used this as a stocking stuffer. Everywhere he went, people loved it and wanted to know where we got it. It lasted for quite awhile until he started getting teeth and chewed a hole in it. Definitely glad we bought one though.... totally worth the entertainment!"
We love this little guy and your baby will too! Great for those little hands to hold on to and adorable as well.
"This is a good purchase for the long run, because one pack is never enough, and they're a little pricey to buy only one pack at a time."
"These looked so cute in the pictures and they are just as cute in person!  My first baby loved pacifiers from Day 1 so I figured my second baby would as well.  I bought a few different kinds to try them out but she just doesn't want any of them!  Still, I would recommend these cute pacifiers for anyone whose baby would take one!"
"These pacifiers are wonderful. Our baby holds them and cuddles them. They are expensive, but we'll made and worth the cost."
"Such a simple concept well executed. It is one piece sewn together, i thought it was just going to be a clip on- but its great bc the whole thing can be thrown in the wash."
Item shipped on time and was exactly what we expected. Our daughter loves it and it is a great self soothing product for infants teething and working toward teething. A must buy! Thanks!
This is not only cute but loved by the baby and parents. I think it is a wonderful gift for a baby!
My kids love these. Much more attractive than most pacifiers. I think they stay in their mouths better than others.
"I used these with my first baby and they were the only ones she'd take. I bought the orange ones for my second baby and they are adorable, even though my second baby isn't here yet."
If yer little one is not used to those plugs / binkies .. what ever it is you call them do not buy this item . The plug is stitched into the mouth of the animal of choice and is well stitched . Very nice item ! I ended up taking it apart bc my grand baby did not like how big the plug was . So if you are crafty you can swap it out for a dif one :o)) He loves it now that i have fixed it .
"I've tried the natural rubber pacifiers on all of my children as they were babies, since the materials they're made out of are more natural. Each child has preferred this style of pacifier, so we keep going back to them. They're definitely cheaper than the natural rubber ones. If you try the rubber pacifiers on your baby and he/she doesn't take them, I recommend this kind. They're BPA free and orthodontic. The curvature of the brim is perfect for not rubbing up against baby's nose (a problem in most rubber ones I've tried) and the holes in the brim make it so very little moisture gets trapped between their skin and the pacifier. Also, the smoothness of the plastic brim doesn't irritate their mouths from friction while they're sucking."
brilliant idea.  Makes it easy for your baby or toddler to find their soothie when sleeping in a dark room.  Deserves 6 stars.
"Good quality, BPA free, easy handle it. Baby won't cry with it. And my sister love it, two packs can be used for a long long time."
I got this paci to pair with a tuxedo onesie I have as a gift. It is very small (perfect newborn size) and the mustache doesn't overwhelm like some of the other ones I have seen. It's so cute and it was a big hit!
"I'm soo happy with the WubbaNub I got for my daughter! It's becoming the new &#34;it&#34; baby item everywhere, I had to jump on the band-wagon and get one for my newborn! :-)"
My granddaughter loves her Elephant!  The product is very durable and easy to clean.  It also is very soft and easy for little hands to manipulate.  I have purchased more including as gifts.
"These binky's are a god send for my son! He only uses a pacifier to relax himself to sleep and in his car seat! These little guys stay in his mouth better than traditional pacifiers, and my little one loves to squeeze and cuddle the soft toy, its comforting for him! This little lamb is for my niece, I hope she is as helpful as my sons wubbanubs are!"
"For this baby, these have been the best pacifiers! The nipple stays in her mouth and they are nice feeling. I recommend getting at least two! Every baby is different, so pacifiers are trial and error, but we are loving these. Baby loves that she can take it in and out herself, and chew on the mouthguard for her teeth, too."
Bought this for my grand daughter who is three months old.  Works great.  She can hold the monkey and the pacifer<br />stays in her mouth.  Monkey is nice and soft.  Life saver
Got this for my daughter and nephew and love it. It's so cute! It also makes it nice if you have a toddler who likes to help with baby; teach him/her to grab animal to stick binky in baby's mouth. It's a win win.
"This is our first child, and he loved the pacifier like this from the hospital, so that's all we've tried as he takes it immediately. He hasn't shown any signs of nipple confusion with a paci...once he's fed, he'll take this willingly and is great with it."
"My little guy loves this, it is the perfect size and lightweight. Best thing we have gotten for him by far!"
"My baby LOVES his wubbie. Mild panic sets in if we are away from home and without wubbie. I initially thought the price of this was ridiculous, but now give huge kudos to its creator."
Purchased as gift and they love it.  My granddaughter had other wubbanubs and they are great for newborns.  I would recommend it for anyone who is expecting.  It makes a wonderful gift.
So soft and baby can easily grab it and put it in her mouth. Plus it's so adorable we love it
"I know I know, kids with teeth shouldn't have binkies... but if your kid does and you are worried about binkies becoming a choking hazard I have found that these ones do not break like the silicone ones do. I suppose any latex one would work but with my son and with my eight years working in childcare I have found that most kids really take to these throwback pacifiers. Plus the retro look is sort of in right? ;)<br /><br />On a side note there is a newer model of these that stink. The nipple is smaller and they get stuck when the air is squeezed out. The ones in the picture are the ones that stink. But when I ordered these I received the older ones (not pictured) which are amazing. The older ones look the same except for the they have a ring of the nipple around the plug where the handle is where these ones just have that flat yellow plastic piece."
Cute and perfect for a newborn. My daughter loves sucking on the animal part. Very easy to wash. I throw the whole think into the washer and dryer to clean. This binky makes for some priceless pictures with little one.
"i bought this pacifier for my little boy's first birthday mustache bash!!! it was so cute!!!!  everyone just loooved it!!! it is well designed! it really makes it look like he had a mustache:) and the pacifier was nice as well,plus it comes with a cover for it! definitely recommend it!"
"This is my favorite gift to give for a baby shower! Puddles the Frog is my favorite, The cow and monkey are cute too. This is such a unique gift and such a great idea. LOVE, LOVE LOVE them."
"I have tried every single pacifier in existence over the course of four babies...and the MAM ones are the ONLY type any of my kids will willingly take. Every other one, even ones that are similar in shape, get spat right back out. It's crazy. I have friends who have said the same. I've also had no issues with my breastfed babies and nipple confusion/preference while using this paci, and I like that this brand has lots of cute designs."
"We swore we would never use a pacifier.  8 weeks later, we've now tried 4 different pacifiers (AVENT freeflow, AVENT orthodontic infant pacifier, AVENT soothie and NUK classic), and this is the only one our 2 month old son doesn't spit out instantaneously.  The material seems very durable and it's easy to clean.  We think he may like the shape because it's closer to simulating a nipple or a pinky finger.<br /><br />The shape is a bit different from the 3 other brands we have, but I actually find I like it better.  It doesn't lay flush to the baby's mouth, which allows saliva to run or dry.  With the other pacifiers that curve with baby's face, the saliva just pools around his mouth and caused a little bit of skin irritation.  Our baby may have sensitive skin, but it seems better with this soothie.  One disadvantage is that it pops out easily and has nothing to keep it in place - though I guess we could get around this by fastening it to him, but we were paranoid about having anything hanging around his neck.<br /><br />I guess every baby is different, but our little boy gives the Phillips AVENT soothie for 0-3 months 5 stars."
"I got this when my daughter was 2 mo old and oh my oh my, best thing EVER. She is now 2 1/2 and STILL sleeps with it only how as a stuffed animal because the binky part fell off. It made life so easy when she was little because the animal kept the binky in place and when she was older, she could easily find it. Im pregnant with my second, this time a boy, and Im ordering two for him as well. They are soft and fluffy and easy to wash in my front loader machine. Again, really really love them. 100% worth every dime I spent on them. &#60;3"
"This item is great. With our first 2 kids, we were constantly losing their pacifiers. Hanging it to their clothes, with a clip was not an option for us. This allows us to easily find our baby girl's plus without having to tear the house apart. It's also light weight. We also bought the caterpillar one and found that to be a little heavy for her."
"I was interested in trying the WubbaNub's. Had seen them in a specialty store, but I wasn't convinced they were a good idea. Well, they are. Easy to find in the diaper bag. Easy to put down so the pacifier stays clean. Easy to find in the crib. The tiger is the BEST."
"These are great as baby gets older.  Lovey and pacy all in one.  Great that the adapter fits other brand pacifiers too!  We like thus one due to multiple textures, silky ears and paws and fuzzy body.  Washes well in washer too, but easier to snuggle with when Baby grows and it's hard for them to cuddle the wubanub since it's smaller"
I just love my baby girl's bunny. We get so many comments on it. Most people don't realize it's a paci until she puts it in her mouth.
This is sooo cute!!! My daughter started outgrowing the pacifier shortly after receiving this but I loved it the few times I got to use it!!
"I love this pacifier holder, it's easy to attach to any bag, stroller... And binky is always at fast reach for crying baby, very practical."
Wonder but I wish it came in a much smaller case so it's easier to put in my diaper bag.  It's great for around the house and the wipes are small enough for the pacifiers so you know you aren't wasting a lot of material.
"I love this monkey pacifier!  Great idea!  My son wasn't a big fan of pacifiers.  However, I purchased this as a gift for other friends and their babies loved it.  They also loved it as well because they wouldn't lose it.  Their babies would hold onto the monkey while sucking on the pacifier."
Bought for my grandson as a baby shower gift and this is his favorite pacifier and wont take anything else.  Light weight and easy to find.
thanks
"My granddaughter loves this &#34;paci&#34; as she (8 mos.) can manipulate it, thereby keeping it handy at all times (mostly!) The legs and body of the bear do the trick!"
"This is a super funny pacifier. Only thing is that it is a little big. Better for 7-10 months in my opinion. I really liked it though, but my daughter doesn't use it much because its a little big. she is 5 months."
"So easy for my 10 month old son and I both to find at night. He loves the MAM 6+ shape, though as a younger baby he didn't prefer the MAM newborn pacifiers."
"I breastfed my daughter for the first two weeks but unfortunately my supply was never established and she dropped almost a pound of her birth weight so we needed to supplement with formula.  She is now exclusively on formula.  When we needed to supplement, I had a horrible time trying to find a bottle that she would take.  I started with the Lanisoh bottles and the Medela bottles because they are supposed to be the best for breastfed babies.  She would not take either of them.  Then I tried First Years Breastflow bottles and Avent.  Again, she would not take either of them.  You can imagine how absolutely stressful this was with a baby who was not thriving.  Eventually we found Dr. Browns and she did take them relatively well, but she always spilled so much formula while eating because the nipples are small and she couldn't &#34;latch&#34; onto the bottle properly.  This made for a big mess and also for a lot of gas because she was sucking a lot of air while trying to eat.  These bottles have BY FAR been the best I have tried with her.  She rarely spills a drop and she is not really gassy on these bottles at all.  Plus, the inclusion of the pacifiers is a wonderful bonus as this is the ONLY paci she will take other than the weird looking Soothies.  She latches to these pacifiers the best, and yes, I have tried MANY MANY brands just as I did with bottles.  These bottles are easy to clean and having the ability to sanitize them in the microwave is a HUGE bonus!!  I find that they don't leak as long as they are assembled correctly.  I also enjoy having the ability to make a 5oz bottle - many bottles only go to 4oz in the smaller size.  Overall, I think these are the best bottles on the market and I highly recommend them.  They have pretty much literally been a lifesaver for us."
My daughter loves these. the toy is plush and soft. I wash them in the Born Free sanitizer then hang dry. the toy helps keep the pacifier in place and makes it easier to find.
"Our baby is 9 months old and can't live without a pacifier. We were using NUK orthodontic ones but I wasn't sure if it's 100% toxin free. I got these in 6-12 months. The nipple is small, similar size as NUK's 0-6 months ones, and the indent isn't deep enough to give space to the nose, and it has the rubber smell. But our baby doesn't care about any of these. He LOVES it. He's been sucking on it, chewing on the handle and the disk and just doesn't want let go of it. It's not only a paci for him, but also a teether and toy. So no need for me to buy a separate natural rubber teether for him!"
My girlfriend and I love the whole fake mustache trend and this is almost as funny looking as the baby pacifier with a mustache. They work great for identifying your drink at a party too. Highly recommended
"I was introduced to this model/brand in the hospital where I came home with 2. Every baby is different and mine took this one immediately after the 2nd day she was born (thank goodness). It is extremely durable and easy to clean. I with either place mine in the microwavable sterilizer I used with bottle parts or wash with hot, soapy water & rinse.<br /><br />My baby has rejected a couple other brands (by flat out spitting them out or I take it as &#34;rejection&#34; when they don't &#34;pacify&#34; her and she keeps fussing). This one always works so when I find something that works baby-product-wise I stick with it!<br /><br />Why I ordered more here on Amazon - quite simply - the small size makes them easy to lose and I have a laborador that I have to be quick about grabbing them if I drop them since she has likened them to one of her toys (sheesh!). So there is no fault of this product - I just care to stockpile these. I keep them in the nursery, in my nightstand drawer, in my diaper bag and in the car.<br /><br />They have 2 good-sized holes where I can easily string a paci-clip through, too. I will for sure re-buy and highly recommend to expectant mothers trying read reviews to determine what to get in advance. This would make my top 5 list of must-haves."
Very nice!
He cant sleep without these! We have purchased 3 of these so far! Very satisfied the tricky part will be taking it away!
"as i expected! it is just fine, just as it looks on the picture. My friends kid loves it. s"
"This passy is really cute, and can rest on the babies chest or side to anchor it in place (if you're lucky)."
My baby loves it! We have several for her and she loves them. Just as pictured and that's always a good thing!
these are great pacifiers. The design is child friendly  and cool. the only draw back is when you wash them sometimes water gets trapped inside.
This product works just as advertised.  Good build quality.  I would buy this product  again.  I highly recommend to others.
Love wubbanub.  These are so cute and a super great value for 3.  Love the different kinds of animals I can order on line.
My daughter is now 6 months old and this is her best friend!  She learned fairly quickly how to put this back in her mouth on her own which saved us many a trip up and down the stairs to her room.  She only uses him at night and on occasion when she's trying to sleep while we are out and about.  The giraffe makes grabbing and replacing so much easier for little ones.  Well worth the money.  Easy to clean too as we just put him in a pillow case and run it through a delicate cycle with her other clothes.
My 10 month old loves the MAM pacifiers! She especially loves chewing on the silicone sides. I definitely recommend them.
"As a mom and lactation consultant, these are the pacifiers I use and recommend. They're safe, one piece, easy to clean, and shaped the ideal way for breastfeeding babies - as you want them to use their mouth to suck. I like that this is a two pack because you always need one and a spare when it comes to pacifiers."
"My wife bought this after hearing a couple people talk about them on Facebook.  I had my doubts, as to why we needed this.  But it really does help our 3 month old sleep better.  When the pacifier pops out of his mouth, it usually gets lost.  This doll helps to keep it  in his mouth because it rests on his chest. He spits it out much less than before."
good product. works perfect. syncs great with exisiting set. would recommend the summer infant baby touch camara for moms who need visual reasurance.
i had never heard of a wubbanub until someone gifted me with one at my baby shower. this keeps the soothie pacifier (the kind they gave at the hospital when he was born) my baby loves in his mouth and not all over the floor. it also means he isn't screaming every time it falls out! why didn't i invent this?! worth the money - i have four of them now. the animals are laos very cute.
i never thought i would actually need one of these but the concept is perfect  and we have actually used it already. bette safe than sorry!
my son loves it! it's soft and comfy.  if your child is a big toy story fan they will love it too.
this sports cup for toddler's works so well and cleans so easy i need to order about 3 more! recommended - highly!
purchased to use along a sharp tile edge in my pool so the kids don't poke an eye out when being rough. works good for the purpose. i had to be creative to find something...
"i was not familiar with alva and had always bought &#34;name-brand&#34; diapers, but i was pleased with this diaper! i will order more!"
"you get what you see in the picture, works great for securing my toddler in the rear of my camaro just fine."
just the right size and match!  nice deep slots perfect for storage and bins in front.  will make a great shelf after changing pad is no longer needed.
"my little baby love it when it is bath time, alots of fun. just enought big for his little hand"
Works great and everyone always tells us how cute or cool it is cover is good but seldom gets used
"Unfortunately, my son refuses any and all pacis. We have bought several brands and this just happened to be one we tried. He hates them, but I am sure these are great pacis though.."
"it all works. we can see her, hear her, and carry this to other rooms. check check check. worth the peace of mind, and a little higher quality to hopefully last more than one kid."
"i am an exclusive pumper and i attempt to switch out the valves every 6-8 weeks and the membranes every 3-4 weeks to help with suction and production.  i have found that it is not always enough to just switch membranes as the valves will get loose from cleaning, effecting suction.  this is a perfect set of valves and membranes for my replacement schedule."
these were for my daughter - she loves them. they arrived fine and are really cute.  the material is squishy and hopefully her little boy will love them too.
love these! they were easy to attach and hold a good bit of weight. they are just what we needed.
"car seat is awesome. daughter who is 4 loves it. but like most car seats or booster seats, difficult to buckle in"
i appreciate it! very helpful!i love it! btw glass bottels is much better than other matearial bottles!it's very important! remember it!
the item came exactly as described.  it was really cute and sized correctly.  cannot wait to order more from them.

"i love my beco gemini! it's so comfortable and easy to use. i have other carriers (an infantino and a boba), but this is my favorite!"
"we opted to purchase the normal sized leg warmers (12inch length) instead of the 'newborn' size as we want our soon to arrive wee one to be able to grow into these. the quality is superb and the shipping was fast (as well as free as most of the items from judanzy qualify for free shipping!) altogether we purchased seven pairs of leg warmers, though as our wee one grows and we acquire a more ample wardrobe we will be purchasing far more."
"i love the cloud b sleep sheep, but got his because my godson's theme was jungle animals.  turns out it fits easily in the stroller or bassinet, and then could be used later in the crib.  now his &#34;raffi&#34; is his favorite sleep toy!"
"my wife has this by her side every second we got our boy in bed. i catch her checking monitor, moving it around and zooming in and out lol! it's been awesome for us"
i bought this for my 5 year-old grandson for when he sleeps at my house and it works great.  i would recommend it to anyone.
"this travel cart made our experience at the airport with our 1 y.o. daughter a breeze! we knew we wanted to bring our britax marathon car seat along for our trip and having this cart meant we didn't have to lug a car seat around the airport (in addition to having a toddler, two carry-ons, and a backpack). we were able to use this as a &#34;stroller&#34; and since my daughter loves being in her car seat, she was happy to ride along. attaching the car seat to the cart was easy since it latches on using the car seat latches and anchor strap. we were stopped multiple times in the airport by people with positive feedback on how brilliant of a product this was. we had no problem maneuvering our 25 lb child in her car seat while attached to the cart. when it was time to board the plane, the cart easily folded up and was compact enough to store overhead. we couldn't be more pleased with this purchase - well worth the investment!"
"i'm so happy to report that this fits my son's bed (he's a toddler in a twin bed). and the mattress is extra thick with a memory foam on it, and this is still tall enough to &#34;save&#34; him. :) it's quite long, too. which is great. very sturdy. my son shakes it back and forth in play sometimes and it doesn't give. :)"
"my 6 year old loves the color, texture and actually uses it for its intended purposes! discreet, pretty and functional! highly recommended! i got the punchy pink for my 8 year old and was surprised that it glows in the dark! we love this product!"
"you know the giraffe i'm talking about... this is just as good for a fraction of the price. the squeaker is loud though, you were warned!"
We love this and will be sad to give it up when we hit the 6 month mark!  He sometimes will suck on any available piece which has been a source of fun for us.
My son loved it!  He used it all the time when he was little.  I would buy more of them next time.
Love that these glow in the dark. Makes it easy to find it in the middle of the night! Great pacifier.
"Although we had another pacimal, it was getting worn out.  My son took to the first one easily and he absolutely loves this one.  It is a great product because it is a two in one product.  You have the paci and the toy,  we never leave home without it.  I would recommend this to every parent out there."
These are the best ninnies. My daughters came home from the hospital w that  and I hadn't used it at that point. Tried several ninnies bit she only took this one. I bought so many b the bounce and we loose them a lot. I also don't wanna b in a jam where there is none.
"We have 4 &#34;Giraffy's&#34;, though our daughter is only aware that 2 exist at any one moment in time.  I'm not sure what she would do if faced with all 4 Giraffy's.  My guess is she's giggle.  And then rotate them so each had a turn.  There is nothing cuter than a baby with a giraffe hanging out of her mouth off a pacifier.  Oh-- and it's super easy for them to find it in the crib, and easy for them to hang onto it when they're newborns."
These are the kind of pacifiers that come from the hospital so it's nice to have some extra's handy. Plus it's nice to not have to worry if the baby will like a different one because they are all the same.
you just hook in on the Diaper bag and it keeps the pacifier handy or you can put a back up pacifier in it just in case you misplace the one the baby is using. I'm loving having the Pacifier Box.....
"This little guy is so much cuter in real life! He is seriously adorable. My daughter isnt a huge fan of pacifiers, so we havent gotten as much use out of this item as I hoped, but I have washed it a handful of times in the washing machine (in a lingerie bag) and it still looks great!"
"Like so many people said before me in their reviews, this pacifier stuffed animal combo is genius. Why didn't I think of something like this! The pacifier is the perfect size for and young infants maybe up to six or eight months old, not too much older than that. It is firmly, I mean firmly attached to the stuffed animal. The little stuffed animal reminds me of little beanie babies, but smaller and a little lighter.<br /><br />My grandson is only three months old and he was a preemie, but when he got his little hands on this pacifier combo, he would not let go. His mother and father were so surprised to see him actually reach for this little pacifier and put it in his mouth himself. He wont let ho of it. They love it too because they don't have to worry about him spitting it out or dropping the pacifier to the floor so much. The weight of the little stuffed animal, even though it is really light, does keep the pacifier near or on the baby when he lets go. The little animal is not so big that it would be too much weight on his chest or cause worry of it occluding his breathing. It's just the right size."

"used this to add a special funny touch to a baby shower diaper cake. Now that the baby is born, looked so funny and cute on him! Great buy!"
"Leave the great pacifier debate at the door, please. Our rugrat adores these. We had tried the old-school soothies to moderate success, but the ergonomic/orthodontic shape of the nipple on these works much better at keeping these in her mouth, and keeps her happy along with it. The glow in the dark only lasts a few seconds, so don't delude yourself into thinking you'll be able to find them at night on the floor, but it's really not an issue. Great pacifiers all around."
We have tried two other brands of pacifier and this is the only one my son (5 months old) likes. I appreciate the snap-on cap feature which keeps the pacifier clean in my purse or in the diaper bag. Very pleased with this purchase.
"Definitely helped my LO with gas and colic issues! We had a lot of trouble finding a bottle she would take, when we came across this set. She took to it immediately. And the fact that they are super cute is a plus!"
"Comfortable and an EXCELLENTconversation starter meeting women in bars, especially in the south!<br />Try it, you'll be glad you did!"
This cow is much softer than my other Wubbanub that's a lamb.  It is like a velour fabric.  My only complaint is that the cow I received did not have black feet like I expected from the photo.  Maybe it's just a coincidence that the cow in this picture has its spots right on each of its feet.  Wubbanubs are awesome!  I never have pacis dropped on the floor and my little girl loves to hold onto it.  I have also washed it in a mesh lingerie bag and it washed up great!  Just have to let it air dry which didn't take long at all.  I actually gave it to my daughter still damp straight from the wash and she didn't have a problem with it!  Great product.
This is a gift to be sent to Turkey for my great grand son.  It is adorable and will be excellent for a baby's small hands.  Shipping was fast and item was in original wrapper.  Love it.
"I love these adorable little guys!  This one is smaller than the original sized ones, about half that size.  He's cute as the dickens!"
"If you want your baby to look like a creep, or your brothers baby to look like a creep in my case this is perfect!"
the product is great quality and a great price. I definitely love it! I would definitely refer this product! Very stylish as well
These are so great for peace of mind!  No chemicals and our kid loves them for naps and bed times.
"Love TT pacifiers and this design is just adorable. They seem to fit my 9 month olds face a bit better than NUK, though we use both."
"I was worried about it coming off, but it is very well attached to the pacifier. This is my second, and will probably buy more! Son loves these at naptime."
Was looking for a holder for my sons spottier when I stumbled upon these gems. The price is worth it. Baby doesn't lose his paci in his crib as often. And he loves snuggling with his giraffe. I bought 2 so we always have back up in case one gets lost. People are always commenting on how cute and unique these pacis are.<br />Friends of mine just had a baby. Since the hospital uses the soothies I'm buying some for the new baby!
Would buy again.  This was a requested item for a registry and I had no trouble getting it shipped directly to the recipient.
"My son likes this pacifier much more than the traditional style ones.  He can grip it, take it out of his mouth, and even put it back in.  He's had it for two months.  He just turned 4months and it looks he'll get a lot more use out of it."
"I expected the animal to be heavier but I guess it's best that it's light so my 1 year old can waddle around with it. She loves it because it's easy to carry around. I love it because she likes to drop or throw her pacifier and it doesn't roll away anymore, or I can find it easily if she's playing in her ball pit."
My baby Grand daugher had a different one that the dog got ahold of so I ordered her this one and she loves it!
Those are really excellent pacifiers my daughter loved them and like other mothers I tried so many other pacifiers my baby wouldn't take any. Literally there is no brand of pacifiers of pacifiers I haven't used. Those are excellent and very light and soft on her face. She loves them and I love them . The shape is excellent it does not hit the nose.
The colors are great. They seem to know what colors go with the child's wardrobe. The shape of the Lavoisier makes the baby happy.
I love these binkys! When my baby's come home from the hospital they get one from the hospital. So I needed to buy some for the next baby. Just in case I lose the one from the hospital! The price is even great!!!
"These are excellent pacifiers that held up well and were the only kind my super colicky baby would take. Also, they aren't terribly expensive, so we were able to stock up. Being able to stick your finder in the sucking area is helpful in getting the baby to take it and is great for freezing water in when your little one is teething (which happened at 2 1/2 months for us). Highly recommended!"
I bought two pacifiers for a baby shower gift.  They are very cute and I'm sure they will keep both the new baby and the Mom happy.
Great quality and my granddaughter likes these very much. We also use the Mam bottles and this brand last a very long time.
"This type of pacifier is the only kind that my little girl will take. No, the ones I received were not the ones pictured but really, who cares? She is happy and not crying which makes me happy."
Super fast delivery. One of the best things that I purchased for my little bug. It's easy to hold and clean.
"So glad to have cute girly ones for my new baby girl, & these are a little better priced than in the store, which is nice cause I seem to be misplacing them often. Its nice that I can grab more just a click away. Amamzon-Prime is a stay at home moms best friend!"
we wanted a nicer mattress for baby in the bassinet portion of our graco cuddle cove pack n play. this fits snugly and provides firm support for baby. good price!
our 6 month old (now almost nine months) opens right up when he sees this during bath time. i guess he likes how the bristles feel against his tongue or the numbs on his gums. often we just let him chew on it because he takes to it so easy and it's a real gentle rubber.<br /><br />excellent way to help start building good oral hygiene.
these work great. the baby had a hard time with other &#34;newborn&#34; pacifiers because the nipple was too long. these are just right and he takes them right away.
"i was on the fence of buying this based on other poor reviews of an offensive odor, however i did not experience anything like that. i even took a whiff close up of the insert and couldn't smell anything offputting (and i'm 38 weeks pregnant!).<br /><br />i purchased this diaper bag insert for my summer tote bags to be converted into diaper bags. my daughter is 1.5 now and i don't have to tote nearly as much stuff as i did when she was younger. there is plenty of room to organize everything for her as well as my stuff in this.  it's really exactly what i needed and it's very simple to remove and transfer to another bag.  the insert fits perfectly into a new tote that i just got from target for only $30.  i like this solution so much more than having to tote around an actual designated diaper bag. it's more practical and i get to reuse my existing bags.  i'm glad of my purchase, and i've been using this for a few weeks now with no complaints."
"It's been a year since I bought this towel for my son, and it's held up great. He still loves it, and he uses it every time we go swimming. It wasn't cheap, but I'm so glad I got one for him!"
"My baby girls love these pacifiers.  They have a &#34;fat&#34; end, so they are able to hold onto them a little better.  The latex is squishier than the silicone, which I like, too.  My twins are breast fed and they have no problems going back and forth between the breast and these.  Only complaint....it would be nice to have more color options, but that really isn't a big deal."
"This is my 5th baby and none of the others have taken to a pacifier.  I have had two thumb-suckers, so I always want to avoid that.  Finally I have a baby that will take a pacifier, which for a busy mom is great, especially in the car when I can't get to her.  I will say that she had some nipple confusion in the early days when I used it too much, so I just waited a couple weeks and now she's doing great with them.  Only wish we hadn't lost the pink and purple ones so quickly!  Time to order more!"
"Love this brand, it's my girls' favorite.  Thanks for offering it and shipping it out so quickly, really appreciate it."
I purchased the Ulubulu Pacifier Set for my sister that is expecting a boy in May. I received a lot of good comments about it. Several of my friends and colleagues have  purchase this set.
This is the absolute best pacifier for my baby! He can hold this one in his mouth because the nipple is a little larger. Perfect for us & totally my style!  Win win!
I like it. I like toy with pacifier. Toy is very soft and light. The pacifier is soft and good quality.
My 6 month old son loves it!  I get a lot of compliments on it.  very cute when he's using it.
My son has been using it since birth. So cute I get many compliments on it & my son loves it he squeezes the monkey tight when falling asleep lol a little hard to clean but I can manage.
What is there to add?  Baby loves her binky and it's incredibly handy to have extras around the house or in her crib when she spits it out in the middle of the night and goes searching.  Plus it helps bring out the color in her eyes.
"I love this! Thanks to the stuffed animal it stays in place, even when baby spits it out. Never fell on the floor yet! I exclusively breastfeed and this pacifier hasn't caused nipple confusion."
Enjoy carrying this around.  It can hold 2 pacis.  Very sturdy and i carry it around with me every where<br />I go
"My son loves these NUKs. He has used them since he was a week old. I liked the solid colors of the nuks, how ever the ones we got were pink and purple so we gave them to our friends as a shower gift since they are having a girl."
My daughter loves her wubbanubba! We received it as a gift and purchased a second.  It's great for holding on to as they fall asleep.
"this is the same binky the hospital uses, my last two kids have liked them. no spit/face rash. no complaints exactly what we expected."
My son loves this so far! He has played with the monkey more than using the pacifier! An that is fine with me! =)
"I'm a new mom and I bought these because I heard that they are great for breastfeeding babies (avoiding nipple confusion, promoting good latching with the shape).  They've been wonderful! Can't beat the price, arrived well packaged, no &#34;funny plastic&#34; smell.  Loop is big enough that you can easily pick up one-handed (thank God) but not too big where it constantly hits things.  My 5 week old loves playing with the loop, working on her coordination.<br /><br />***No breastfeeding problems, baby loves them, mommy loves them.  5 stars for me!<br /><br />I don't know why everyone is so concerned with the colors.  It says colors may vary, pink and purple are colors too! I get that it's a gender-normative thing, but seriously who cares if your boy sucks a pink pacifier if he loves it, it costs less than $2 and doesn't cause breastfeeding issues? A good product is a good product."
"Great! My baby loves it. It sounds exactly like the womb. My baby sleep throughout the whole night, and during the day!"
VERY CUTE! BUT THIS IS A HUGE PACIFIER
Love this! Easy to use and I like it better than the pods other people gifted me. Easy to open and close and clean.
"My daughter loves it. Nice one piece, east to clean. Soft. My daughter can even play with it like a toy"
Very good item. I loved to open the bottom to clean the bottle. The scale is very helpfull to make the milk.
cant beat these paci's yes buy these kind they are just<br />the best sort of paci and soft :)<br />always used
Two out of three of my sons have taken to a pacifier when they were babies.  This is the only pacificer that either one of them would use.  Makes for a very happy momma!
"My boy is 9 weeks old. We have been giving him these since he was 2-3 weeks old. He doesn't love any pacifier, but he will at least take these. We also tried the nuk pacifiers, but he won't take those at all. These he at least will self soothe himself with! Will be recommending to all my friends."
This is a great little paci keeper and I can manage to fit a Soothie and an ortho in it. I put it inside a small pocket in her diaper bag and we are ready to go.
"I bought these , cause they matched they other things I bought. and they seem to be comfortable for  Baby."
"from birth until 2 months she didn't really like soothies,, but at 3 months she liked it! now at 4 she loves it!! only thing is it distracts her and she pulls it to play with it and no more use as paci lol...<br /><br />also she crosses her eyes to look at it which I don't like but she def, loves it"
I bought one of these for my nursing nephew not knowing if he will be taking a pacifier.  HE LOVES IT!  They are all so cute.  It's hard to pick just one.
"My baby did not want to use any of the pacifiers sold in the stores. I did not intend to use a pacifier before he was born, but it came out that he sleeps so much better with a paci. So I ordered Soothies and my life was saved for about 6 months, until he dismissed these ones too. A MUST-HAVE!"
Our newborn baby girl (5 days old) absolutely LOVES her little elephant pacifier holder. Her little fingers / hands can get around the elephant and she has something to &#34;hold&#34; onto as best as possible. I'd highly recommend - great item and fast shipment!!
"My daughter ADORES her monkey wubbanub. She asks for it by name. She has a special laugh for it. If I would allow her to have it 24-7, it would only leave her mouth long enough for her to eat.<br /><br />However, I am concerned about the wubbanub monkey being a bad influence. We were travelling through an airport and as my daughter and I were getting ready to walk through the metal detector, a TSA agent informed me that she needed to x-ray and inspect the wubbanub monkey. I was initially surprised because wubbanub monkey has always been a faithful, comforting friend. He would never harm anyone. But apparently, the wubbanub monkey is the new face of terrorism. He looks sweet and innocent, but I guess those are the ones who look really suspicious. After trying to explain to my daughter why they were taking her monkey away, the wubbanub monkey was placed in a bowl, given a visual inspection, and run separately though the x-ray machine. My daughter still loves her monkey, but I can't look at him the same anymore. I hope that by giving him lots of love, we can deter him from his path of potential terrorism."
"I love these. For the short time my daughter would take a pacifier (as hard as we tried, the thumb won out... darn it) she loved these. They were the only ones she would take. Saving them for the next kid. Worth every penny."
Got this when my son was 6 weeks and he was able to hold on to it bc he likes to hold onto something while he sleeps. I was really getting aggravated when he would wake up wanting his paci and it would be dark so i couldn't find it and it was constantly falling out of his mouth. with this if i swaddle him he can't push it away from his mouth. and he was already sucking soothies so whoever came up with this idea is genius. And i love that you can just stick it in the washing machine.
"I got this kitty pacifier for my daughter that is expecting so we haven't used it yet,but its really cute."
This is my little babies favorite pacifier.  She absolutely loves these things and wont take any other pacifier at all
My son loves this.  It is a little trouble to wash but very cute to watch him hold.  Adorable :)
Wonderful designe and she likes it and oh so much more adorable with it :) love that it doesn't get dirty when dropped
This is too cute. Got it in mail quickly. Holds the pacifier in my grandsons mouth and he holds on to elephant. Will be a big hit come football season!
"We started off with a similar pacifier provided by the hospital, but it had a full round silicon disc that he didn't like. These have a similar texture and the oblong shape means his nose doesn't push it out of his mouth."
"These are wonderful. Our child loves them and the attached stuffed animal helped them hold, control, and find the pacifier. We felt it helped with hand eye coordination."
"These are wonderful. Our child loves them and the attached stuffed animal helped them hold, control, and find the pacifier. We felt it helped with hand eye coordination."
"Our son's name it Pete, so of course he needed a dragon pacifier. We keep two at a time on hand: one in the diaper bag in case he feels insecure when we go somewhere, or to help him fall asleep in the car seat, and the other in his bed. Sucking on the pacifier is part of his going to sleep process. These WubbaNub pacifiers are great when the baby is little because they can hold on to it and keep it in their mouth much earlier than when it's just the plain pacifier. And both our boys preferred this type of pacifier. But now our son is 18mos and it has become like a security lovie. Other than falling asleep, he doesn't need it often, but it sure makes him feel better to have this along. The dragon is unusual enough and bright enough that it's easy to find if he drops or misplaces it. When he was younger and used it all the time, everyone at the gym childcare and church nursery knew it was Pete's dragon."
"I bought this as a gift.  The mother seems to really appreciate it, so I guess it does its job :-)"
This is a wooden pacifier holder that is well made and absolutely adorable! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a baby or as a gift for the parent whose style is a bit more edgy!
This is a cute pacifier and goes along well with the nursery and baby shower theme of elephants and giraffes.
Love this cute owl and pacifier - it is so adorable!  What a great combination - can't wait to give this as a baby shower gift!!
"These are my daughters &#34;lovey&#34;, such a brilliant invention.  She learned how to put her pacifier in and out at 6 weeks on her own, can't beat that!"
My daughter requested these for her new baby. They seem to be good quality and are very cute. Nice product.
"With our first baby we barely ever used our Wubbanub, and I wondered what all the fuss was about. But by the time our second came along, I knew how to work it into the swaddle properly to hold it in place. Now I've discovered I can't live without it. After our dog ate our last one, I went a couple hours trying to use an ordinary paci, and I just can't go back. Totally worth every penny.<br /><br />Also, why would you not buy the dragon one?"
My little girl loves her wubbas!  Can't wait for her to see this in her Easter basket.  She's gonna love it!
"My baby girl loves her wabbanub, out of all the pacifiers I tried this one is her favorite...she has been sucking on it since she was a week old and now at 3 months she plays with the giraffe more and more..."
This pacifier was the only one accepted by my bb since he was 2 weeks old. Ans still he takes it. (Now he is 6 weeks old)
"If you are a parent who pacifies their babies with these wonderful devices, you know how difficult it can be to keep track of these darned things. Buy this pack and put them everywhere you go (in the car, various rooms, hiding spots for an emergency). They are the same great quality you expect when you buy them in twos for twice the price in the grocery or department store. So next time your kid throws his pacifier into the mysterious bermuda triangle of pacifier extinction... no sweat... just grab another one. Our son loves to throw everything (including pacifiers) into the trash when we have our backs turned :)"
We love our wubs! I have recommended to many friends.  If your baby uses a soothie pacifier these are great!
"Love these binkies only ones I've used with my babies, easy to clean I the container, fun cute colors for baby girl."
"They come in a nice clear case, so it's perfect for a baby shower gift! They're adorable! Arrived on time with no issues."
Adorable - I purchased 3 for my granddaughter.  Haven't had to wash one yet but they look very durable and well made.  They are soooooooo cute.
My 2 year old still uses a binky and loves wubbabnubs! This bull is cute and well made. We have about 5 different wubbanubs and he loves them all!
The only thing my 5 month old takes for teething. Same for my friend's 1 year old - the only pacifier he'd take.
"I bought these for my 6 month old even though they are labeled for 0-3 months because these are the same size pacifiers that she has on her wubbanub. She loves her wubbanub to cuddle and play with but we wanted to have a couple spare pacifiers on had as well. I use these in place of the wubbanub mostly when I wear her in a wrap or carrier, any other time she wants her wubbanub!"
The Nuk is the only pacifier my son likes - he didn't like the fancier and more expensive ones. And the price is great!
cute idea!  Mommy & Daddy-to-be were impressed with it and goes well the theme & dcor of baby's room! Fast delivery and in good shape-was here in plenty of time for shower!
These pacifiers are just like the pacifiers they give your newborn to suck on at the hospital. My infant loved them!
"I ordered the Jasmine Giraffe first and since my daughter loved it so much I ordered the Ella Bella Elephant as well. I think these are such cute little comfort objects for a baby! My daughter is six months old and was starting to have a harder time going to sleep so we thought a comfort object might help bedtime go a little more smoothly. She absolutely loves her wubbanubs! She plays with them, cuddles with them, uses the attached pacifier (which surprised me because she rejected a couple other pacifiers we had tried) and holds one while she sleeps. She also figured out how to use it really quickly and will pick it up and put the pacifier in her mouth on her own. I also love the size, perfect for little baby hands to grasp, not too heavy for the pacifier, and doesn't add bulk to the diaper bag for on the go. This has been one of our most worthwhile baby buys!"
wish it was all pink.  we can't get these locally in the small size in pink.  bummer.  these are ok and I'm glad they were an add on item.
These are the cutest pacifiers for our little grandson!!  Great quality and great price!!  Definitely will buy more!! Highly recommend!!
"My grand-babies love these, and I like the fact that they come in a case for storage. The case is also used for sterilizing the pacifiers in the microwave.Nice! I recommend this item."
cute gift idea along with other items. The recipient liked it very much. Went very well with other gifts with cute sayings.
"tried many pacifiers, and this one was the only one that stuck until the baby was 5mo. highly recommended for newborn."
We had to order this as a back up to the one we already had.  My daughter really loves these.  The only downside is how long they take to dry when you wash them.  Hence the need for an extra!
love them ....great colors but  wish the white ones were a different color say purple or two other of the fun colors...love the snaps!
these are a wonderful baby gift that just look so cute on the baby.  everyone loved them at the shower.
"my sensory-seeking 3.5 yr old would chew on his shirt collars when he got anxious. when i first sent him to preschool, he was quite nervous about the new environment and being away from mom for the first time. so, as his favorite color is red, and he loooooves cars and trucks, i bought him this, which he calls his &#34;chewy car&#34;. it helped him immensely in his transition to the new environment, and he loves the thing. (it actually feels like a friend for him, in the same way a stuffed animal might. i make it &#34;talk&#34; about feelings, etc.) i put a red grosgrain ribbon through the hole, and sewed on a breakaway plastic clasp to make it into a necklace for him. he can put it on over his head himself, but it can break away in an emergency if it gets caught on anything. i wrote his name and my phone number on the ribbon. it hangs on his room doorknob when not in use, so he always knows where it find it. it's still in great shape, with his moderate/occasional use."
this works great to keep my son in bed. he sits and waits for &#34;harry the bunny&#34; to wake up before he calls us to get out of bed.love it!
"this gate is fantastic! not only does it fit perfectly in an ordinary doorway, but it's tall enough to keep my dogs from going over it (even our great dane), which is exactly what we wanted. it was pretty easy to install and i bet the extensions would be as well! we just didn't need extensions because our doorway was the first setting for the gate. we didn't use the hardware with the cups that it comes with to secure it against the wall because we aren't so much using it for safety, but to keep our dogs out of the nursery. however, if you plan on using this on stairs or somewhere that would be hazardous for the baby to get into, the safety cups that secure it strongly to the wall with screws are completely necessary in my opinion. the swing shut gate works perfectly as long as you adjust it to the doorway correctly. it's very smooth and easily maneuvered. this gate is tall, versatile, and perfect for every need. overall, the gate is everything we wanted and more!"
"parent is happy with the product and so is the baby! i would suggest this item to others, as well."
"very cute - our baby loves this!  and, it's not been lost yet - even though it goes out of the house daily!"
these are the only prefolds i have ever tried so i have nothing to compare them too but i really like them! my son is one and we're still using them to stuff and line his other diapers. i prefer these to most of the other diapers that we have!
definitely worth buying! my two year old loves it and the set is a great quality. we are happy with this set.
My granddaughter loves her Wubbanubs.  She has three of them and my daughter keeps them in the crib.  When she wakes up at night she feels around for one of them and it helps her go back to sleep.  My daughter gets more sleep this way also.
Our daughter loved this binky! I was upset when out new puppy chewed it up!!!! Would buy again if we wasn't trying to break our daughter on the binky now
With my daughter I had to get up in the middle of the night when she couldn't find her nuks.  My son finds his own.  I put them up to the light right before bed and it glows most the night.  Much easier!
"My 5mo is able to grab the kitten and play with it and use the pacifier. She is pretty picky about pacifiers, so far this is the only one she seems interested in.  I think she likes the kitten more than the pacifier! Definitely worth a try."
"My twins like them, looks great too, I like the fact that they are light and easily kept clean, you could put them on a table with the nipples pointing up."
"My grandson is expecting his first son. Things are not always easy for him and his lady.  The day my package arrived for them with the Mustachifier in it was at the end of several of those difficult days/weeks.  I was delighted when my phone rang, and Chris exclaimed with pure delight, &#34;Nana, you made my day!!  You made OUR day!!&#34;  Their joyful voices made my day, and left a glow for several days after."
my 4 month old had problems holding in pacifier during sleeping and we had to get up multiple times during the night to put pactifier in...this product stays in much better than a regular pactifier and she loves it! it puts her right to sleep...and now she can put it in herself!
I bought this as a back-up to the Wubbanub catapiller. This is such a great idea to hold baby pacifier in baby's mouth. She loved both but I think the monkey's tail is the perfect handle for Courtney to hold on to.
"The stuffed animal gives my son something easy to hold on to.  Lately he has been gumming the dragon about as much as sucking on the pacifier, but it keeps him calm so that is all that matters.  To clean it, we run it through the clothes washer and hang dry it.  It is well made.  If your child likes soothies, they probably will like this dragon WubbaNub."
"Recommended to me by new grandmother who said WubbaNub was one of the best things her grandaughter received.  My expectant niece has an &#34;elephant&#34; theme so when I saw the WubbaNub Elephant, just had to get it.  Cute and everything I expected."
"My 3rd, and last baby, is a bon-ified pacifier baby! And I don't have a problem with it :) He looooooves these pacis. He will not take anything else, and won't even take the &#34;wrong&#34; color of pacifier. They definitely soothe him and he uses them mostly at nap and bed time."
"My little granddaughter used these from the start with no hesitation. At 6lbs 8ounces the small was perfect for her. We opted for the round and since she is a nursing baby we wanted to reduce nipple variations. I would recommend these, we were very attracted to the fact that there aren't any grooves were bacteria could live and grow. Also the fact that it is a natural product, rubber from a rubber tree."
"One of the BEST purchase for our daughter, yet!  (4 months old).  :). It stays put, it a perfect for in the car seat, and she loves playing and talking to the lamb....."
"These are wonderful.  Pacifiers go everywhere in my house.  I know have at least 10, but I could never find one when I needed it until we bought a few of these.  My son likes to hold onto the animal, and the weight of the animal helps him keep the pacifier in his mouth, especially in the car-seat.  Just don't let your baby have one of these for sleep!"
my baby loves this thing.  It actually helped her learn how to grab things better and it was easier to stick in her mouth when I was in the car at a stop light and she was whining.
I LOVE these bottles. They are the only ones my daughter would use once I went back to work and relied on bottles when we couldn't breastfeed! They are self-sterilizing which is a huge bonus! Also very cute patterns!
"this playpen works well. it is not that high, but little dogs can't jump over it.  i had to buy the extension to make it larger for more than one dog."
its a toddler swing seat. i have added it to our swingset at home. great quality that will stand up to the elements.
"it is lightweight, easy to fold and unfold, handy storage basket.....great stroller for nana & nana loves the tangerine. tired of fighting the fancy stroller i can never"
"this was a good find for a bath toy.  when you shake it; it makes a sound, but not that loud.  and the &#34;shower&#34; like drip from the ball when there is water in it makes my child laugh."
bamboobies are much better than those bulky throw-away pads.  thin but very absorbent.  i leak a decent amount and they contained it all.  throw in washing machine in a delicates laundry bag.  definitely recommend.
i love that i can let go for a second to soap up a wash cloth and not worry about him falling over
i ordered these for a shower activity (bib decorating)<br />to buy individual bibs from the local craft supply would have been about 5$ more<br />these are exactly what i needed - plain ol white bibs<br />i kind of wish that they had the plastic stuff on the underside but i was also not trying to spend a lot of money
"this was a great purchase- it's thick and soft, not flimsy at all (not sure why some reviewers would qualify it as thin!) and it's big enough so that my just-turned-one-year-old will be able to use it for the next couple years even as she grows! it's a great soft yellow with a cool print on the binding and inside the hood. love it!"
"i have a variety of cups for my 1 year old in the cupboard. since lids keep breaking or a dog keeps chewing on the lids i've had to buy more cups. these cups are amazing! my son got once for his birthday which is what made me want to buy more of these kind of cups. they don't leak, my one year old can hold it, and they have great characters on them. they are by far my favorite cups for my son to use."
our son likes to play with this because it makes a little rattle noise.  he doesn't really chew on it but he sure likes to play with it.
"tiny little purse-looking boxes. i loved them! i put an e.o.s. chapstick into each bag, with some little pacifier shaped candies, and closed it up. it all fit great into the bag. the cutest thing on our table--- besides are delicious baby shower cake!"
"we don't have a baby but use the flushable whips in our bathroom.  they usually come in a flimsy containers that makes them dry up before all are used. saw this and thought perfect....and it is. sturdy, easy to pull out one at a time, even without holding the box, and the whips stay moist till the end."
"me, my wife and our son (2 yrs old) love these bottles. they are well made, easy to clean and contain no plastic. only downside is the price. we waited on the silicone sleeves but eventually got them also and have to say they are also great and an improvement."
this product better that others. the quality is good and it works as described. highly recommend for those people who breast feed their newborns.
"it's simple, practical, fits nicely and so far we love it! it cold have a higher back or a specified size for suvs but it works."
"i bought these as bath toys for my 7 month old. teething has reared it's ugly head at our house and i gave him one to chew on when i was at a loss. it is perfect as a teether, super tough, won't tear, and he loves the colors."
One son and daughter in law asked for this as a baby shower gift. We were lucky enough to use it when we visited and it  works well.
"My wife got a friggen Yankees binky for our two month old.  So I had to buy a Red Sox one.  WTF gets their kid a Yankees binky?  Luckily I ordered this Red Sox one using her Prime account so it got here fast.  They also work wonderfully.  Despite the yankees binky, they are the same type and it is the only type she will take.  I think the bulb design is a wonderful thought, especially for kids like mine, who will only take nipple shaped items.  Would recommend to others!"
"I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animal for girls or boys.<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone.<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth. She has also learned over time to guide it into her mouth on her own.<br />4. Durable - after several washes in the machine, it seems to be holding up just fine.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe.<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning."
"I put this in my wife's stocking after we found out she was pregnant. She loved it. I am sure it will work great for the baby, but I assume no one is looking at this for a long term solution, but just a short gag here and there."
These are great. They stay in the mouth really well. Easy to find in the crib because of the color.
I chose this specific one for the colors. Go Gators. But my son loves this one more than the puppy because its lighter and brighter!
"My daughter LOVES the wubbanub! The weight of the kitty keeps it in her mouth much easier than a regular soothie, and I can even &#34;tuck the kitty in&#34; with another receiving blanket around her to keep it from falling. She loves feeling the plush and uses it to help get in her mouth herself now that she's a bit older."
"My son, who is breastfed, was comfort nursing on me every half an hour so at 3 weeks we introduced a pacifier. We bought dr browns, soothies, wubbies, and these. These are the only ones he really likes. We can sometimes get him to take a soothie after a very long struggle. Will be purchasing more of these."
"Best pasifiers on the market I believe. When she's not using it, she can chew on it as a teether. I love the flexibility of it!"
"My baby girl had open heart surgery when she was 11 weeks old, and one of the nurses recommended the Wubbanub because my daughter loves her paci. The very first time she used this after we got home, she curled her arm around the caterpillar and fell asleep. So cute!"
"Like most of avent products, these ones do the work well. No complaints.would be better if you can choose colors, design, but not a big deal"
These are my all time favorite pacifiers. I have had a harder time finding the glow in the dark ones in the store. Still I would keep looking before paying more than $7.
FINALLY!!! This is THE paci we got at the hospital. It isn't available in any store I have been to. It's not the &#34;gumdrop&#34; marketed brand found at babies r us or other big retailers online or otherwise.
if you are thinking to buy soothers these ones are the best on the market I try it on my little ones and its perfect 100% recommend it
In the picture looks much bigger than in reality but I think it is a perfect size for baby.  Gliders does not look as it shown in the picture.
"we bought two of these, one for our almost 3yo and one for the 9mo and couldn't be happier.  because of space both girls sleep in graco pack and plays and these are just what we needed.  they fit perfectly and make the bed so much nicer.  an added benefit is that i am short and the three inches this raises the bottom up makes it easier for me to put the baby down when she is sleeping.<br /><br />i would highly recommend this for anyone using their pnp as a place where baby regularly sleeps.  good quality at a good price!"
"price is amazing, and so soft and comfortable - so much nicer than the cheap cotton one i got from a regular store. ordering another one! and buying in another size too!"
mam binkies are our favorite. these were a little more expensive than getting them in store (7.99 vs 5.99 or less) but i have never been able to find these colors in our local stores. i'm happy!
i bought this for my one year old and he absolutely loves it! a great teether too! he also enjoys having his few teeth brushed when he isn't chewing on it. a must need for every baby/toddler!
"product has worked as promised.  the baby,  who has chewed through several pacifiers in the past, has not bitten through this.  he's had it a month.  and it's still in good shape."
"i use these caps on a daily basis . very good , no spills .  fits most bottles !  i really like it ! fast delivery !"
this is a very nice bath towel and washcloth set. my son loves diego. the quality of this set is far supieor than his previous set.
"our old stroller just wasn't fitting her well anymore.  she would place her feet on the wheels and the seat size was too small.  this stroller is lightweight, easy to steer and easy for the grandmother to use.  we have another lightweight stroller that was around $200.  this one isn't quite as nice.  but for the price you can't go wrong.  i recommend it to everyone."
"my two kids use many products from thermos, and this is by far my favorite design! and of curse, all thermos we have work totally great without any complaints. that's why i keep getting more from them."
"we now have two of these bibs! i ordered our first several months ago and was so happy with it that we ordered this second one.  i love that it's large enough for my almost 2-year-old to use while eating (she is messy!), but also big enough for my 3 1/2 year old to use while finger painting (she isn't quite as messy...).  a great bonus is the ability to throw these in the wash.  i try not to do that too often since i would like to preserve the velcro as long as possible (washing them with soap and water in the sink has kept them fresh as well!)  once the velcro does wear out i will use my kam snap device to convert the velcro to snaps.  we have tried and gotten rid of lots and lots of bibs over the years and this is one of the few that i will likely buy even more of as my 3rd child begins solids.<br /><br />a side note - others have mentioned the pocket being sewn down the center rather than being completely open to catch food.  i haven't found this to be a problem, and it might be that it's because the bib is long enough that the pocket is sometimes under the table - tucked in, per say.  i tend to use a shorter, stiffer bib when my kiddos are little and just beginning to eat solids."
this adorable lamb stuffed animal and pillow is so soft and cute. my little girl just loves its. we bought it for her at 10 months and she immediately loved snuggling it and playing with it.
great replacement tubes for my pump. i haven't had any issues and i've had these for a year now. i would buy them again when the need arises.
"i wish i'd known about this pillow from the start. we started using it when my daughter was two months old, after her pediatrician became concerned about a flat spot on her head. (it was to the point that it was messing with the symmetry of her face.)<br /><br />we noticed a difference when we used it, but she started daycare at 2.5 months and we regressed. fortunately, we were able to get daycare on board with using one, too, and it's made all the difference in the world. after two months of consistent use, she is no longer a candidate for a helmet.<br /><br />we own two and use it in her crib (yes, i know the risks), swings, activity gym, etc. you have to be diligent about using it, but if you start early, it can make a big difference. my only complaint is that i think they're ugly as all get out, i wish boppy would make more color options/patterns that aren't so bleh, but it's still better than suffering through a hot houston summer with a helmet."
"these wall decals are easy to apply, and easy to reposition! couldn't beat the price either! would highly recommend as this looks adorable in a little girls rooms."
"these are great for pumping on the go, especially when you want to fill philips avent natural instead of the medela bottles. they are solid construction and boil just like the name brands."
"our baby went on a nursing strike for a couple days. this *might* have been what got her back on the breast; it's hard to say since we tried a lot of things at the same time.<br /><br />the first couple feeds with this our baby definitely did not like it - but then she had already stopped feeding from the breast too. we would offer it to her, she would refuse. offer again, refuse. then after a couple tries, she did feed from it. a couple times the first day we had to start with our regular nipple (dr browns) and transfer to this when she was a bit more calm; then she would take it. if she was really really hunger this was not the way to get started.<br /><br />as others reported, she did seem to occasionally choke, maybe on a heavy flow, maybe air, the first couple times. the flow didn't seem slower than other nipples - maybe even faster when she was really hunger, but she just had to work for it. we just had to take the nipple away for a sec and then she'd continue when offered it again.<br /><br />this also made it easier for her to stop feeding when full - she had a habit of feeding until she spit up before, and not tolerating a bottle being taken away, but with this nipple she will stop when full.<br /><br />by the second day she was taking this regularly and by the third day she was back to breastfeeding. not entirely sure this is what did it since we also tried a few others things, but it seemed to help.<br /><br />there are a lot of bad reviews, so i guess it doesn't work for everyone. maybe people didn't stick with it (which i understand if it causes your baby to choke), but it was great for us with a little perseverance."
"the little spiders float, and so happy to have found something safe for my son for the bath without all the bad stuff. he loves catching them!"
i got this diaper bag for my daughter & she just loves all the pockets. it is roomy & the strap is comfortable on the shoulder.
"love sproutware. measuring inside in case you want to know how much they are getting, my son loves using them. great for feeding and bringing snacks with you."
nice gift for a one year old - the straw is unique in that you can tip the sippy cup and still drink from the straw which is good for new drinkers.  plus it is stylish!
"i was worried that my children (3 and 1) would be freaked out by this, but they love it, and even ask for it!  we don't use the music feature much, but they giggle as it tickles their noses.  it is easy to take apart and clean, and equally as easy to reassemble.  my kids have less hidden in their noses than i thought, but i can still tell that this is being effective (especially on particularly runny days).  i would def suggest this to anyone who has children who cannot blow their noses, either from age or healthy problems."
i used these for a lamb themed baby shower and they were a huge hit! great toy for not a lot of money.
"it works great, is very sturdy and easy to install! definitely recommend it to anyone  needing a gate-i happen to be restricting dogs but the hands free option really works and works well!"
"i had sophie with my 29 month old when he was a baby and now his 4.5 month old brother is enjoying her. i think they didn't really start to play with her until 4 months old, but she's a big hit for teething.<br /><br />two notes:<br />1. if you have dogs you need to be careful where this gets left. this is a highly appealing toy to dogs due to how awesome it squeaks.<br /><br />2. do not submerge in water or the squeak stops working for a while. i think we got water in it once trying to clean it and it stopped squeaking- but it eventually dried out and squeaks fine again. i think the bigger issue might be mold because there is a little hole in it so it's a possibility."
This went up with no problems and stayed up with no problems.  What a transformation in my bedroom for why it cost much cheaper than a picture and looks great!!
"I love this thing. It's easy to find. Adds a cuddly-ness to the binky for additional soothing. My daughter loves it. She has had it soon after birth, about a month old since I didn't want a pacifier to interfere with breast-feeding. She will be six months old next week.<br />The one star reviews mention washing problems and needing to stitch it. I have washed mine on regular cycle with no problem many times. Still really white too."
"Avent pacifiers are always very well-made, and my daughter absolutely love them. She won't put pacifiers from other brands in mouth."
She loves it and it's helping with the teething.  It makes me feel a lot better that it's not plastic and made out of real rubber.  Wish I had known about these sooner!
"My friend bought one of these for my baby because her daughter loves it.  At first, I thought it was just a gimic and wouldn't be used much, but my one year old brings them everywhere he goes.<br /><br />After using it and regular pacifiers for a few weeks, we ended up only using the Wubbanubs.  My son was able to manipulate them to get them into his mouth at a very young age but had a harder time with regular pacifiers.  He would also drop the regular pacifiers but the fact that the animal is attached makes it harder to lose these. If you place it on top of baby's tummy when he (or she) is in his car seat, he can actually find it himself.  It stays there whereas a regular pacifier would drop to the side.<br /><br />We bought three different animals after the first one but my son's favorites are the monkey and the puppy.  He even tried to use both the monkey and puppy at the same time on a couple of occasions because he loves them so much."
"We have purchased many of these for our daughter and our friend's children.  They are a hit!! They love the binky and the stuffed animal gives them a super soft cuddle buddy at night and nap time.  The nipple is very soft and will rip once your child starts biting and holding it in with their mouth, causing a possible choking hazard.  We have since changed to a similar style designed for toddlers.  WubbaNub hit a home run with this!"
This is the 4th one I have bought. This one was for a boy baby shower. They are so nice and babies just love them. I highly suggest for a new baby.
"Grand baby loved it.  Will be buying more....Fast shipping very pleased just perfect , cleans easy very soft right size"
"My 9 month old doesn't take pacifiers most of the time, instead she uses them as teethers.  She LOVES this one - gnaws on it whenever she gets the chance.  I had high hopes she would take this as a pacifier, but she just hasn't.  I'm ok with it though and won't dock a star in my rating.  It's incredibly well made, natural rubber, and she loves it.  I wish I had ordered the 2-pack instead of the single!  I am on here to order the next couple sizes (age ranges) up for her and thought i'd better let everyone know what a great paci this is, even if your kiddo doesn't want to use it as a paci!  I think I am going to look into their rubber teethers and order one of those too."
My daughter has loved pacifiers since she was born and these Mam are the only ones she will keep in her mouth. These have saved my life in more ways than one and I'm constantly purchasing more as my daughter looses hers. I love the design as well.
The thermometer comes in handy when you have a fussy baby who refuses to stay still and need to know if they have a fever. Medicine dropper same way
Love love love these pacifiers. The orthodontic shape is important for oral development and I am so happy with these! Wish they came in more colors though. Hold up great in dishwasher and in microwave steam sanitizer bags. Great product!
"Oh my geez, if you buy this, as a lady, your uterus will begin demanding you have a baby. That's how cute it is. I speak ridiculous gibberish every time it's in the room. It actually may be a weapon from another planet, because adults turn into blubbering idiots in its presence, because it's too cute. I got this to be the topper on a diaper cake for a giraffe baby shower, and it looks wonderful. Did I mention it's cute?"
"This product is quality we really liked me and my wife this will look good on my unborn child this, I hope to continue buying in the future with amazon"
does what it's supposed to do.  son loves it.  helps him with his gerd and in regulating his feedings.  thank you very much.
"This is exactly what I had expected, perfect for my new little nephew!  Just adorable!  Great product!  I Love it!"
We love this bedding!!! My daughter wanted to do something different in her son's nursery so we went with camo and John Deere and love it.
"Although he liked the soothie from the hospital, it wouldn't stay in. The MAM stays in until he's ready to spit it out...or he sneezes!"
My little one LOVES these !! These are the best thing ever made. This is the only pacifier he will use. I think we have at least 4 wubbanubs:) I just ordered the lamb one for when he is baptized. These also wash very nice too! They are very easy to find in a diaper bag and when my little one wakes up he just puts it back in his mouth. He has no problem finding it. I don't know it we could live without it:)!!!!
This is such a fun and creative way for a small child to be able to keep track of their binky!
Purchased for my Grand daughter to assist with feeding<br />Help with strengthening jaw muscles<br />Good product<br />Have used on my other grand children
I bought this set as a &#34;We're Pregnant!&#34; gift to give to my parents that are big Cubs fans. We wrapped them up with a little note saying &#34;Please keep these for when I come to visit.&#34; They loved it and cannot wait to see their grandbaby use this!
"Love these. They are the only binkey my 9 month old will take (she still prefers the 0-3 month ones instead of the 3+ which are harder). They are great at night because we just throw a bunch of them in her crib so she can find one if she wakes up, but they don't hurt her if she rolls over on them."
"These are our fav. We used the smaller sizes as well. The stars lured me in, the glowing handle is neat but not super useful, but we still love them."
I love this thing! It is so adorable when my daughter sucks on it! She hates pacifiers- except for this one. She plays with the bear and loves her &#34;wubbie.&#34;
"Received in under 3 days. Well packaged, and ready for gift-giving. Neice loved it! Perfect size for a baby to wrap their little arms around. Colors are pretty and patterns lively. Don't think I could pull the little animal from the pacifier if I tried. Well made."
"Really cute and a real conversation piece?  Luv it, Luv it, Luv it! I doesn't even itch, but tickles all who see it?  Really fun item!"
my lil guy loves it hes asleep on it right now and hasnt made a peep. i love it :)
"our daughter wanted a pacifier for her newborn daughter that was similar to the one provided by the hospital, but easily located at all times. the wubbanub is the perfect solution! the baby loves it! i purchased several different ones for her, featuring different animals. what a cool idea! no more lost pacifiers!"
"we bought roan rocco in 2012. always had wanted a pram for our baby so she could stretch and be really comfortable. my husband and i spent many hours &#34;test driving&#34; different carriages sold by baby stores. unfortunately, here in the us, as strange as it sounds, the choices are very limited. the stores either sell carseat-type carriages or trendy european carriages that are also built for the convenience of the parents and do not seem to have enough room for the baby.<br />roan rocco pram had everything we'd been looking for, and a very reasonable price. i was somewhat skeptical about buying online though. to my pleasant surprise, the pram arrived the same week we ordered it. it looked awesome, much better than it did in the picture. the bassinets (both of'em) were huge and the built quality was top notch. we now have the 2nd bassinet on and it's just as roomy as the first one. really really happy with our stroller. we've had it for over a year now and it gets complemented almost every day. it's extremely comfortable for the baby, safe, great looking and unique. what's not to like?!!<br />a special note about the dasalika. two weeks ago i needed an extra part for the stroller. i located my amazon order from 2012 and sent a message to the seller. oleg called me in three hours after i hit the &#34;send&#34; button!!!! a week after, the extra part arrived. superb product + superb service = very happy customers!!!!"
"these gates are a godsend and worth every penny.  my fiance and i got a german shepherd pup and baby gate jumping was completely horrible and made us feel like a prisoner in our new house.  these are easy to put together and we have two of them.  we got our first one at lowes for 10 dollars more and loved it so much we came to amazon and bought another one for $10 cheaper . highly recommended, great for big /crazy dogs like shepherds."
"just the way the product was described. i am a wedding planner, and i was really happy with the purchase.<br />recommended."
i love love love these! they are adorable and easy to apply to the walls in my baby's room. there doesn't seem like a lot of stickers but there really is! great buy!
my mistake i thought this was a diaper its a cover...its great the designs are cute the buttons are really great they snap fine and stay closed my niece looked cute in this.
we have the &#34;cera&#34; (triceratops) wubbanub to go with this rattle and they are both great!  one's for sleeping and one's for playing.<br /><br />the rattle:<br />high quality stitching so it won't fall apart.  noisy enough for baby without being annoying to dad.  super cute design for my little dinosaur.  can't go wrong.
"we purchased this for our 4 month old daughter and she loved it, she's currently 5 months and is sitting up like a big girl and playing! we love it, it fits anywhere and everywhere, as well as easy to transport when she spends time with grandma :)"
"this blanket is sooo soft and washes up like a dream. our son loves it so we take it everywhere. it keeps him warm but i would recommend only using it to cover up not to swaddle with. the side you see in the picture has the softer fabric but on the other side is a slippery fabric like satin, which would make it hard to hold/swaddle a baby. the color is great and only slightly darker than in the picture. it's perfect for anyone doing a winnie the pooh theme or just likes the character."
"when my son started being able to stand up in his crib, i knew the mobile we had hanging wasn't going to last. i wanted something that would help him learn that its ok to be on his back in his crib. this is the perfect solution. the only negative i have found is that i wish the images rotated. i have it hanging on the side of his crib, and the images are sideways. i could move it to the top of his dresser so that the images are showing the right way, but i don't think he much cares. he loves to push the light button and has figured out how to stand up and turn it on on his own. the music is the right volume and lasts long enough for us."
"this product works great and is very nice to look at. it is so much better than my previous \\paper towels all over the counter\\ drying method. this is the type of product most of us first time moms don't register for because we have no idea how much stuff there will be to wash after baby arrives! it has a very unique look to it, but the \\grass\\ is also very functional. it helps keep everything upright so that things dry faster and allows excess water to drip down to the tray below. the size is perfect for the area next to my sink. i live in an apartment and have a smaller kitchen so i would not want anything larger taking up a huge amount of counter space. despite it being compact, it can handle several bottles, all of my breast pump parts, nipple shields, and baby teethers. i am very happy with this product. i recently purchased the flower extension to add a little bit more surface area."
"cute starter silverware set for our daughter. she loves elmo, and these get her excited to try to use them with her food. they are short, so perfect for little hands (she's 17 months old). they are well made and i would buy these again!"
i like these because they stand on the counter and i don't have them rolling all over. they work great and i use them for lots of things. i love the variety of sizes.  i recommend them!
this is a fantastic product. i wish it was around when i was nursing 20 years ago.  it is an absolute must for nursing mothers.
"Really, every bathtub area should have them, just in case.  They are cheap, very strong, and secure solidly to any clean ceramic or smooth non-porous surface.  They are easy to remove and leave no marks.  When you get it, be sure your tile has been installed correctly.  Mine easily supports 100 plus pounds.  Remember you need it before you slip or fall."
"This pacifier has my nephew looking like (insert rapper name here)! The baby ladies love it and he's getting mad baby lady party invitations. With the addition of his velour track jacket, Timberland boots and low hanging pants showing a little diaper, this is the perfect baby ensemble. Can't wait to take him for his face tattoo."
"This was my 1 year old's mustache for the mustache and pizza party I through for her and her sister (who turned 13.) Since she couldn't have a sticker mustache, I thought this might work even though she doesn't do pacifiers. She loved it, everyone loved it, and it was adorable."
My son loves this! He can hold on to it and it is very comforting for him. And it is cute too!
We got a lot of laughs out of this binky.  It was a hit! It works like a real pacifier too not just for looks.
"It works. There's not much more that I  can say about some goofy vampire teeth! I got a few great pics out of it, and a happy nephew, so consider it a purchase well spent!"
It was so cute and made out of quality material.. Would suggest this to friends and family! A great buy!
My Grand daughter loves them. This is the only kind she will take.  Plus they are cute and easy to hang onto.
"i do love the glow in the dark of these, makes it so easy to find them in the night!"
"We love MAM pacis, they are the best brand in my opinion. These ones are so cute too, and the price was very affordable."
Love em to death !! My son keeps the TIDE ROLLING! I just might order another set but that would entitle another kid lol
My two children have both used and LOVE the &#34;soothies.&#34; These were exactly as listed and were shipped quickly. I would recommend these pacifiers to anyone.
My son does not take a pacifier. Not because I didn't offer one but this is perfect because he loves to chew on stuff. There is the pacifier part the rim of the pacifier arms legs and tails and a tag he can chew on.
"My brother loves it, his wife hates it. HAHA  I think it's awesome. Baby wasn't sure what to do with it once she got around to trying it, because she was used to the round paci (momma's doing, no doubt)  They didn't even send me a picture :(  Where's the love? Gosh!  I'm totally getting this when I have kids!"
"My daughter has colic. The first out of five. I truly couldn't have made it through the night without this pacifier. She didn't sleep through the night, but it soothed her enough for me to get an hour in. Love it!"
Cute design and super soft with small legs for baby to grasp.
"If you're having a rock n' roll baby, or even if you're just hoping your baby will grow up cool - this is the pacifier for you. It looks cool, it stands up to a lot of suck and people won't comment on your parenting choice to give a pacifier when it's in because they'll focus on how awesome it is. What more can I say? Avoid the judgment, raise a fun kid - get this pacifier."
My baby holds it and it is a great bink for on the go in a carseat or when traveling.
My 3 month old loves these binks.<br />They seem comfortable and are sturdy.<br />I would buy again for sure!!!!<br />Love um
"I have twin boys, one loves any pacifier you put in his mouth, he lives for pacifiers lol the other hates every paci ive tried. I wasnt looking for a paci for him, just my other son, this one came in 2 packs and my boys theme colors were blue and green so I was sold, lol I put this in my sons mouth who DOESNT LIKE paci's and he wouldnt stop sucking it, kept it in the whole way home and jus loves em. These are the only pacifiers ill ever buy.<br /><br />Funny story, my husbands sister had a baby who is also a picky paci baby, he only likes one with a big bubble on the end, however I gave him my paci to suck because he started to whine and he took it out, looked at it then put it back in his mouth! Til this day he has it... which sucks because it was the moon and sun with clouds version and they were beautiful shades of deep blue and deep green. Either way, this pacifier is AMAZING."
"We ordered these after my 8-1/2 month old son decided to play a not-so-fun game called &#34;throw the pacifier down a drainage pipe.&#34;<br /><br />He thought it was funny; mom and I not so much. Especially considering we did not have a &#34;backup&#34; of the exact type.<br /><br />We ordered these hoping they would be similar to the ones he was use to, but as you likely already know, sometimes little ones can be particular about what they like/dislike. While these were delivered quickly and were exactly as listed, our son will not take these. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is already familiar with NUK pacifiers. If you're not sure if your little one will like these, try purchasing a 2-pack prior to shelling out the money for all 8.<br /><br />And if he or she likes them, then order these in case your little one also plays the &#34;throw the pacifier&#34; game."
We tried almost every single brand of binky in our household. These were the only ones my son likes. I love the handle (and the ease of attaching the Avent leash). I like the air vents. The best part is that the pacifier can be put in his mouth upside down or right side up. This allows him to self sooth if he pulls the paci out. I highly recommend these.<br /><br />Note: If you have a question regarding nipple confusion we had no issues with these. He can go from breast to bottle to paci and back again without issue.
This pacifier is the closest I could find to the ones they send home from the hospital!!! Great price! I loved the quality.
"Keeps your pacifier clean and easy to find. Additional great attributes include the product being well-made, stylish, & functional. Love this product & love<br />This brand!"
My wife loves it :p and I think it's really fun and playfull like how babies often are. I don't see anything wrong with it
Got these pacifiers for my little one. My baby is very picky with the pacifiers and will only use these. One she has a hold of one of these she will keep it till she falls asleep. These have been a lifesaver for all. Items came quick and well packaged.
Our 7 wk old daughter loves her Ella elephant- it is the only pacifier she will take! Ordered this bunny for her first easter basket (she will be about 14 wks). Super cute.
"My baby loved these!  And I loved them since they are super easy to wash.  My baby has now moved onto the Avent paci's and with the Avents, water can sometimes get trapped in the nipples whereas, these do not."
"Works great.  The slight amount of weight helps keep it in his mouth, and now he likes holding onto the stuffed animal while he is sucking on the pacifier.  The only down side is trying to clean everything."
These are my favorite pacifiers. I especially love these for night because they glow in the dark and are easy to find when youe trying to put a upset baby back to bed.
"Fast shipping.  When my daughter was born, they brought her in the hospital room with a binkie in her mouth.  Couldn't find them in the stores around here and this brand was the only one that she would take.  Amazon had them.  Thanks so much!"
"Best ever! We bought this when our baby was 2 months old. She was already using the soothie pacifiers so it was easy to switch. Now she LOVES this thing. Its her lovey/paci all in one. It goes everywhere with her at 9 months old. She doesn't always use the paci, but she loves to play with the giraffe, or chew on it when she's teething. Best part about it is the entire thing goes in the washer on gentle cycle (do not machine dry)."
This is the greatest thing ever invented for babies! It keeps the paci from popping out. My daughter is four months old and she loves her bunny!
We have a puppy one.. which we like a bit more because the legs of this one gets in the way a bit more...
Bought Avent 0 to 6 months and she kept spitting it out then I bought these and she latched on right away. She loved it and still do at 5 months. I compared them and saw the Avent nipple was way bigger. Not cool for newborn baby at all.
"My newborn baby loved these! And I loved them since they are super easy to wash. My baby has now moved onto the Avent paci's and with the Avents, water can sometimes get trapped in the nipples whereas, these do not.  These are sold as a 2 pack at Target for around $5 so this is definitely a great buy!"
The ONLY pacifiers my baby girl will take. So glad I found these. I am purchasing more right after I write this review!
"Good product - the glow-in-the-dark feature is a stroke of genius. My son prefers this brand, so it works out."
Very fast shipping and very cute. My daughter loved this and I would recommend it to anybody. By far the cutest one I have ordered!
We were given these by our birthing hospital for our twins.  They have been with us from day one and will continue to be so until our children are weaned from them.  They provide the perfect combination of a pacifier and a toy.  It gives our babies something to hold on to and concentrate on while going down to sleep.  We love these guys and have given many of these as gifts over the past year or so.  I haven't had the first complaint from any recipients.  Clean-up is easy.... throw them in the washer and wash with hot water.  it's as easy as that.
I work in a major NICU and have noticed that some parents buy these and bring them in for their little ones. I am due in 3 weeks with my little guy and think these are absolutely adorable. The  attached pacifiers are the same medical grade one that we use in the hospital. The babies seem to like them and the stuffed animal part seems to make it a tad easier for some babies to keep in their mouths. I will probably end up getting more of these.
I love these to quick clean my pump parts between pumping at work. Cheaper than the medula wipes. I just wipe them and keep them in the cooler until I'm done pumping for the day.
I got this for two of my friends who were expecting and their babies LOVE it.  It's the best little gift for a baby shower.
"Great toy, my child has used this since she was born and after a year and a half we have had to replace it. The nipple is sewn to the stuffed animal so you have to clean the entire piece.  Easy for toddlers to carry."
"Great toy, my child has used this since she was born and after a year and a half we have had to replace it. The nipple is sewn to the stuffed animal so you have to clean the entire piece.  Easy for toddlers to carry."
she's really into paci's and these are very good.  happy with the purchase and have no complaints.  thank you very much.
"Love the wubbanub, got it as a gift for my baby shower. Haven't lost it yet! And baby loves it. Bought it for a friend. Bought it from My Monkey Soup, LLC --simply put, great service! Ordered it Monday got it by Friday the same week! And the price was pretty decent too compared to others.  Couldn't ask for more!"
Our baby loves her plush pacifier. It helps calm her when going down for a nap and for the night and it's so much easier to find around the house and in her diaper bags than a regular pacifier.  WE never leave home without it.
Bought for my grandson - we love these! Super cute and come in handy. Bought several different ones to have on hand.
"Avent products are the best: I like the product, I like the quality, and I like the company care and respect to its customers! Whenever possible I will always recommend Avent!"
Both my kids loved this brand.  They don't yank them out like other brands and can still hold on to the pacifier to put it in their own mouth.
Best pacifiers out there!! I don't have to worry about my newborn falling asleep with any hard plastic or hitting her face on a hard piece.
This is the same pacifier given to my granddaughter in the hospital. Unable to find locally. Great to find it here
This was the only pacifier that would stay in because it would lie on his tummy and because he wasn't rolling it would stay in.  He has this one and the puppy. The puppy looks cuter than the monkey in my opinion - but both have served their purpose and get a lot of comments from people too. Very cute. Easy to wash - just throw in the washing machine. Very happy with these and definitely recommend.
My daughter Loves this binky! it is perfect for me because i cant loose it in my bag and she can grab it and get it into her mouth by herself! It is so adorable!!
"This pacifier is great!  After 3 months, once teething started, the baby loves it and it's been her favorite teething toy for the last 12 weeks.  She can hold onto it herself and learned quickly how to aim it into her mouth.  She likes chewing on the ears and legs sometimes too.  Its made sturdy, and its super cute."
My 2 month old loves these! She can touch and hold the plush while using and they are much easier for mom to keep up with.
This makes life SO much easier! No more fishing around in the dark or having to turn lights on! Love!
"I bought these for my grandson who is just 1 year old. These are cute, durable and easily washable and best of all my grandson likes them."
"This item is adorable!  I love it! i will be purchasing more for sure.  Its super soft, my baby girl loves it!"
I had this saved as a bookmark as soon as I saw it waiting to find out if my niece was having a boy or a girl.  I bought it and used it as a bow on her present at the baby shower and everyone loved it.  The little man looked pretty adorable with it as well.
Absolutely love these. These are what the NICU provided for my preemie and they are the absolute best. I love that they come in cute colors!
The tabby kitten wubbanub is very cute and helps the pacifier stay in place for my daughter. The main reason I like it is its very easy to keep track of instead of the tiny pacifiers that I keep losing around the house.
It holds my daughter's soothie pacifier perfectly. The soothie pacifier is not shaped like most generic pacifiers and therefore do not fit most pacifier cases. This case however fits the pacifier and pacifier holder perfectly.
These are the only pacifiers I buys. They fit the baby's mouth well and I love that there's no &#34;up or down&#34; because its the same shape on both sides. Perfect for 2am binky hunts in the crib.
Amazing!!! My kid plays with it everyday.  She loves to pull on the string & chew the pacifier holders!! it's great!!
"when i purchased this monitor, i was worried about the screen size. it is definitely not a problem. it is big enough that i can see everything clearly. the night vision is very clear. this monitor also has all the bells and whistles that i wanted: remote camera movement, intercom, good volume control, and ease of use. the only negative thing i have to say about it is the battery life. we always keep it on the charger at night anyways, and it lasts long enough to get me through household chores and other things of that nature. plus, the low battery warning is loud enough that you will know when to hook it up. this is a perfect video monitor for a good price."
"my son loved it , it's soft and easy to grab , i hoped for blue or green one and we got lucky with the green one. i would recommend it/"
we just transferred our 4 month old out of our room and into the crib.  the baby is comfortable and sleeps many hours through the night.  this mattress fit in our ikea crib perfectly.
"this cloth book was such a huge hit with my little girl that i've been desperate to find something she will love just as much.  i haven't yet!  this book has kept her enthralled since she was just 2 1/2 months old.  she figured out how to pull the flaps down, and she still plays with it nearly ever day at 5 months old.  the owl page is a little trickier than the others, but she loves the challenge!  she's starting to understand words a little more and is getting more and more out of this book.  i'd recommend this to anyone who wants to &#34;read&#34; to their little ones.  the only trouble with it, is she thinks all books have flaps that need to be pulled down now.  so i read regular books to her, and she slaps and claws at the pages searching for the flaps.  ha ha!"
"after looking at lots of cribs, my daughter and i both loved the look of this one. i read other customers' reviews and many articles before ordering this davinci crib for my soon to be grandson. the rounded bars at front and back are unique to this model and offers diverse uses for hanging blankets, towels and quilts on while not in use. the crib came with good instructions, hardware and good quality wood components. the crib is well made, seems very sturdy and looks very nice in the nursery awaiting the arrival of one lucky little boy."
exactly as pictured. secures well to crib. colors are perfect for any baby girl's room. so glad i finally found a mobile that works as described!
i was looking for a bib that would cover more of my grandson's shirts and after looking at all the brick and mortar stores i finally looked here and found these.  the reviews from others help make my decision and i am glad i purchased these.  was a little afraid about spending so much on after all bibs but after using them now for a few months i am glad.  they have with held the washing machine and are easy wiped down and made of softer material so it doesn't bunch up and crinkle.
i was afraid this was going to look cheap because of the price but it looks like a good quality my only complaint is the stylus is cheap plastic but it was free with it so not a big deal.
this worked great. my son sleeps all night with this and loves it. we always had swaddles with our other kids.
"my 2 year old is obsessed with letter and numbers. these are just great for bath time. we not only work on letter recognition, but spelling. i advise getting 2 sets though because you only get one of each letter."
"absolutely love this diapers bag! i was looking for diaper bag forever until i found this one. i can hold 6 bottles,makeup bag,wallet, 10 formula packages,changing pad with 10 diapers and the travel container full of wet wipes and lots of other stuff, with plenty of room left over highly recommend."
"absolutely the best purchase we made, i love this stroller, as does my daughter.  i highly recommend the bob stroller,  it is great for our daily walks."
"i have got chicco products in the past, and they are very easy to handle, this is no exception. i got it 2 months ago for my 2 year old and i am in love with it. very smooth to travel with, easy to open and close! a little heavy than the average &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; but its defently worth it! the canopy is very large so it covers a lot, even when they are completelly lay back."
it's the best blanket ever! is great for the cold nights because covers your baby and it's soft at the same time. my baby loves it. the size is also great.
"very warm, i love it! fits into our mclaren perfecty. long enough for my very tall almost 2 year old"
"this thing is awesome. i love it, my husband loves it, and my daughter is so much happier going into her carseat now that we have this. it is lined with a cozy sherpa fleece and has a durable outer layer. i can't say enough about how sweet it is."
"this is great to have - finally a place to put all the kids' &#34;babies&#34;! i have been trying to figure out something for years that doesn't take up a lot of room and now i finally found this. however, we have wood walls (not drywall) so i had to buy different hooks/screws to hang it up with."
"gift for a dear friend's new grandson. shipped promptly, mom and dad very happy with new baby's seahawk gear. happy grandma, happy baby!!"
"my daughter has had this over 2 years and still plays with it (well, it comes and goes in the toy hierarchy, but she does come back to it frequently).  good way to work through colors and textures - - was a challenge at first and took her a while to get through them all, but that's a good thing.  now that she is a pro with it, she puts them together quickly and then makes a &#34;road&#34; out of them, or mixes them and makes stories - they are taking on a new life beyond their original purpose.  that's the mark of a good toy.  i've given these as birthday gifts too."
it is so attractive that my granddaughter took to it and that made the potty training very successful. i'll recommend it to others.
"very cute and worked well, usually she uses nuk orthostar but these seemed to be liked by her just as much"
I bought this pacifier as a Christmas present for my now 7-month old nephew.  He absolutely loves it.  He's able to grab the toy and put it back in his mouth.  His mom said it was the best Christmas gift he received.  They also ordered another one as back up.
"good coverage, good sound quality, and pretty easy to set up, i just need a way to enter online to it for my happiness to be complete"
nice set for a newborn or a first time mom. bottles were packaged nicely and everything was in it that was suppose to be. the pacifiers looked ready for use and the sterilizer was packaged separately so you didn't see it right away. definitely will enjoy this set when needed and ordering one for my new baby cousin.
"this bassinet sheet is very soft and good quality. it is a very good buy, and i will purchase more!"
a great addition to my grand daughter's the very hungry caterpillar- themed nursery. looks well made and safe. luv it!
great quality product. i am very satisfied with this product. i meant to order a darker stain but am glad that i ended up with the oak.
just received this yesterday and plugged it in right away. it's very quiet and in some ways the noise it does make is very soothing. i love having a range of settings for how high or low i want it to be. an immediate improvement on our very dry bedroom due to electric heat! definitely a must buy.
these are nice items to have. i like the fact that there is no adhesive and they are easy to move around.
"these things are brilliant - the top twists on & locks into place, making it virtually impossible for my toddler to dump its contents all over the place (like he used to w/ the two-handled snack cup.) cereal, chips, puffs, dried fruit; they're all kept easily on-hand & ready for snacking. the flip-up lid is a nice touch, but rarely used in my house as snacks never last that long."
"we've had the rails for about 2 months now and my 2 yr old has not fallen out of bed once.  because he still wets the bed at times, we have these placed under both the fitted sheet and the mattress protector.  they keep him in, but are still soft enough for him to crawl over when he's awake.  easy to travel with as well.  really great product!"
i bought this for my best friend's baby shower gift. came quickly as promised and box was in perfect condition!
"for something as simple as a night light i was surprised at how particular i could be. i just wanted something to illuminate the bathroom for those late night excursions and a long hallway. these lights covered both very well.<br /><br />pros:<br />2-pack<br />led remains cool and saves electricity year round.<br />visually appealing.<br />nice symmetrical light pattern.<br />dusk sensor present (falls into both pro and con).<br /><br />con:<br />dusk sensor not sensitive enough.<br />not bright enough unless you're already acclimated for night vision.<br /><br />the light is emitted through what appears to be an acrylic lens like a fiber optic. it shines 3 symmetrical bands outward against the wall. one straight up, and the other 2 are angled out from the 10:00 and 2:00 positions. the 2 side bands are about 2&#34; wide and the center one fans out to about 12&#34; wide before it disappears. the band spacing is identical on both of mine so they would look nice if viewed together in a room or hallway. it gives it a precision look.<br /><br />against lighter colored walls there is enough light once your eyes have adapted to darkness. if you need a night light for a space where you're always entering from a lighted area these may not seem strong enough for you. but when i wake up in the middle of the night i can see enough to navigate both areas.<br /><br />so for me, the only real con is the lights remain on during most days, so it's good they're led. if you use them in a place that gets nice sunlight, they will turn off. i'm quite happy with them as long as they last."
these headbands fit my two month old daughter perfect. not tight like some other brands. high quality and exactly as pictured. these are perfect. came in the mail quickly and packaged nicely. ill be purchasing more from this seller.
i am so glad i could still find these. my 7 month old son will only use this type of pacifier and we could not find them anywhere when i wanted to find some replacements.
"i read a lot of reviews, and checked safety ratings before purchasing this seat.  for the price you can't beat what you're getting!  this is simple to put in place (doesn't sit at an awkward angle), light-weight so your child can carry their seat to school for field trips if needed without hassle, and the fabric isn't itchy.  having said that it will still snag like any other fabric and get little &#34;fray balls&#34; if you're kid is rough on it but it seems like pretty good quality.  i have one in every vehicle and my 7yr old son has no issues strapping himself in and making sure the belt is secure under the armrests. would highly recommend over other boosters if backless is what you're looking for."
used this on fireplace edge and corners to protect kids.  very easy to use and took just minutes to apply.  happy with results.
"as others have posted, there are some obvious ways this product could be improved (batteries, easier/multiple time settings, volume control, etc.).  however, compared to similar products, this is the best.  it accomplished what i needed.  my daughter does not get up until the cow on the picture does.  it gives her a sense of independence and gives me much needed sleep!"
love nuby products! bought the entire set for our grandson and he loves them. bright and colorful. easy for small hands to grasp.
"love love love this! i bought a few of the soft silicone freezer trays as well and this one is by far my favorite! i was worried the cubes would be hard to remove since this tray isn't flexible, but you actually push on the edge of the cube to remove and it is so easy-worth the money just for that reason. the fact that it makes so many cubes at one time is also very convenient."
"kidco healthy snack frozen treat trays work well. they're made of plastic, clean up relatively easily, and freeze well. my only beef is that the sticks don't have any teeth or grabbers so sometimes taking out a popsicle means pulling a lid/handle without the popsicle. i may end up roughing up the sticks to remedy this."
my son loves this potty seat and he potty trained fast using this seat and the elmos potty time video. easy to clean and use and the white toilet seat part fits into a big toilet too !
"i love these cups. easy to clean, no extra parts and a perfect size. my son loves them too, especially the adjustable handles. great product, fisher price does it again!"
love the baby magic.  nothing better then a great smelling baby. great for their hair and body.  still use it on my six year old.
i recommend this to every one with a baby or toddler.<br />this is better than a regular belt. i love it!
"some friends of our turned us on to these pail liners, and we purchased 2 of them.  overall, we couldn't be happier.  we have a flip-pop trash can that &#34;snaps&#34; shut, so as to keep the odor contained.  we simply push the bags inside out when we stick them in the wash, and that's it.  we've been using these over a year without any leaking, and we wash/dry them with our diapers.  we dry them on delicate and haven't had any issues.  i'm very pleased with the product and highly recommend them!"
love nuby products! bought the entire set for our grandson and he loves them. bright and colorful. easy for small hands to grasp.
i love it!!! looks very nice....holds lots of toys.  i bought a cushion for the top and i use it as a bench for my grandson to sit and ready when his not playing.
"so far i am a couple weeks into it.  have been using these seat protectors under a car seat and they are definitely working as i would have expected.  spills, crumbs, and all that other junk that magically appears under a car seat is captured and our leather seats are protected. it also is nice to know some of the corners of the car seat are not rubbing directly against the seat.  great price for a little peace of mind."
"3.5 year old twins going on vacation....we purchased these specifically for ease of travel for the airport.  we have a bag to gate check our car seats and wanted to downsize to 1 bag through the airport.  the seats were compact enough to fit, easy to put together and easy for our girls to use when in the car.  our girls enjoyed being in a big kid seat while still remaining safe.  i was leary about them unbuckling when the car was moving but they were very respectful of their new freedom.  these boosters are slender enough that 3 will fit across the 1 row in our everyday car for transporting them and an older brother.  very happy with our purchase."
"this is a great monitor.  i bought this after spending a lot of time researching video monitors, and it received the best reviews on amazon.  the battery life is not as long as i would like, but its only a slight inconvience.<br />i recently contacted customer service regarding an issue, and i received a reply from mae, the customer service manager, within an hour.  she answered my question and provided additional information which was very helpful.  i was very impressed with mae, and appreciate a company that values their customers.  i would highly recommend infant optics products!"
"bought this set for my 10 month old as he seems to like eating foods from a pouch more. the zip top is sturdy, the pouch is convenient and very easy to clean (i just handwash with a bottle brush). it has a fill line so you don't overfill it and a spot for you to note what the contents are (though i just use blue tape). overall, i think its a great set with a great price compared to others in the same category. the opening is on the side which seems awkward but really isn't when feeding and it's definitely easier to spoon food in through the top. i've used this for almost a month and they haven't leaked or anything. would recommend for applesauce, smoothies, and other homemade goodies."
we got this as a present for our niece who was turning one.  she loved it and the other kids at her party (ranging from 1-3) loved it as well!  it was by far the most popular toy.  packaging was great and the quality seemed like it would last a long time.
when my grandson eats with his long sleeve shirts on it can be a challenge to keep them clean.  i usually take the shirt off but now with this bib i don't have too.  it is soft and easy to clean.  i have even washed it in the washing machine.  the pocket catches what he drops.  love the quality and it will last a few years.
arrived on time and it is very roomy! looks well built and the stitching is clean! exactly what you see is what you get.
though this might not be as pillowy as some of the more expensive models i love it its so simple and the cloth is soft and comfortable for my daughter. it is super easy to adjust the straps and to install in the car! would recommend this to any parent on a budget!<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />easy to adjust<br />simple<br />easy to install<br />cheap<br /><br />cons:<br />not very pillowy like better models
the bugs/flower was much larger than i anticipated but makes it even more wonderful and worth the price. i am so in love with this mobile and it hangs right over my daughters crib. the light hits it and it is just amazing. i was looking for a mobile that wasn't cheesy or made of plastic. fits right in with my woodland themed nursery. favorite piece in her room!!!!
"i pump everyday at work up to three times per day.  this tank is comfortable, supportive and functional.  it holds the pump flanges in place and also functions as a nursing bra when i get home.<br /><br />this is a great product that i would purchase again."
"these washcloths are very soft, well made.  they dry quickly, the colors and prints are different.  smell nice while drying, no mildew odor."
best crib sheet we have ever purchased. we look for the aden and anais brand when we buy anything for the kids. hopefully they will start making adult size options soon
there is no volume button do what it is set on permanently is right on the proper amount. the vibration is soft and gentle and so is the music. i just adore the cute elephant and love the colors of it. the whole mechanism can come out which is super plus esp. when we need to was it. i just recommend to stuff tennis balls or some type of object to keep the plush protruding into the space for the mechanism. the women hums the tunes very gently and soft toned. that's another reason why i'm pleased with this. i wish this $$$ out when i had my 1st daughter she loved when i hummed to her. this will definitely stay on our family. i might just get another one. i will even listen to this myself esp. b/c i'm a loud thinker when it's too quiet...lol
parents of the expectant boy were very pleased to get.  i'm sure i'll be reordering soon.  love the quality and the knit sheets fit well under the mattress corners and won't &#34;pop&#34; off easily.
"the blocks are great for stacking, chewing, crinkling, shaking, etc.<br />my son loves them. the colors and pictures grab his attention."
great mirror...i love how big it is and how it shifts to different angles so you are always able to see baby.
My 9 week old has been sucking on these since he was two weeks old!  We have tried several other kids just to see what he likes and he prefers these.  They also seem to stay in his mouth better than any of the other brands and don't require an adult hand to always keep it in his mouth.
"My 7 week old is strictly breastfed and has a natural dislike for pacifiers. This one however, made the cut.  We have tried several kinds out there but this one had a good size and shape that there was no issue for nipple confusion.  I recommend trying soothies before other brands out there especially for breastfed ding babies."
I have purchased several WubbaNub's for baby shower gifts. Babies like to grab the little animal while using paci and they are easy to find once they fall out of babies mouth. They are adorable and I love giving them as gifts.
"This is Zac's new favorite &#34;chew toy,&#34; according to his mom.  He prefers chewing the foot rather than the pacifier, but that's okay if it is soothing a teething baby!"
"It looks too big at first and a lot of people will say it is ugly but it has been great for us. My baby loves it and it is easy to clean. Also, since it is all rubber it doesn't hurt her or mark her face when she sleeps with it."
The only passy my daughter will take. These are amazing and we have them all over the house. These helped ween her from the middle of the night feeding. She learned to soothe herself with this passy instead.
"LO seems to like the free-flow a lot more than the regular pacifiers, they are spit out A LOT less often."
"I love how cute and colorful this pacifier is. The giraffes is so unique and cute. We haven't used this paci yet, but I'm sure my daughter will love it as much as she loves her other Wubbanubs"
Such a great way to not loose a pacifer.  She loves to hold the ears and always knows to look for it.  I recommend!
"I bought this item for my sister's baby shower.  Mustachifiers are so cute, BPA free, and make great conversation pieces."
My twin boys absolutely love this binki. It worked so well and now that they are older they still enjoy playing with the animal.
Great color.  It's exactly what we wanted. Gave as a gift as we have one for our baby and she loves it.
My daughter requested these for her new baby.  They seem to be good quality and are very cute.  Nice product.
"it's worth noting that this spins very fast... so fast that the colors in the center blur.  it has beads in it that make a pleasant sound.  it is very colorful.  my baby is still young to use it, but so far my 3 y.o. plays with it from time to time, and i think it will be a hit with the younger one some day."
very pleased momma & grandbaby both seem to appreciate the positives and anticipate long use and the portable speculation and comfort
used for my grandson during his training and then by a grand daughter two years later. sturdy quality made and children were confident with it.
we put this around our dining room to keep our puppies out and it looks awesome there. very good product.
this item is good for me  i love it so much  the price is suit for me  i lke it
these are quality pacifiers and we know how many you need in the house just to find one!  i would order these again!
these bottles are best for storing milk. no worries about what plastic ingredients might be leaching into your formula or breast milk.
babycomfynosenreally is so much better than the bulb aspirators. don't over do it but otherwise it's great at its job.
love this rocker.  my daughter sleeps wonderfully in it.  she thrashes in the crib and this rocker keeps her snug.  while it doesn't have the vibration feature we don't miss it.  we do place a cloth between her head and pillow i case she spits up just cause we don't want to wash too frequently.  like that it pops shut and locks for easy transport. it even balances if just right when folded which allows me to set down for an extra hand when needed.
my niece just love it.  it is sturdy and well made.  would recommend this to other families who's kids love elmo.
exactly as described and it holds loottss of stuffed animals. i have been looking for one of these for yrs.
"my daughter in law loves this. she saw it in store and i found it here on amazon. this is not cheaply- or poorly-made furniture. it's not &#34;carriage trade&#34; (high-priced, custom craftsmanship) furniture by any means. it's mass-produced. but it's not junk, far from it. perfect for a new (or repeat) mom!"
"these are fantastic. we have twin boys and we use these sleep sacks every night. i use them for bed with a long sleeve onesie, they sleep comfortably and warm."
"you will find this easy to install on your bike, its well made, solid construction, good directions and replacement parts are available if needed."
This is the cutest pacifier pet I ever seen my baby name is bella and I had to get her this it arrived very quick I was surprised very good size never lose a pacifier again:)
"We love these pacifiers for our daughter.  The rubber is so great for her and easy to clean.  I don't have to worry because it's all one piece.  We do use these for longer than they recommend, but you can tell they begin to change and become a bit waterlogged.  Highly recommend."
This was my son's favorite pacifier! I am not sure if t was because it was his pacifier or the attention he got when he had it out in public!
Love the glow in the dark nuks!  They work perfect at night to see and pop back into mouth;). .
"Great product!  A little big for a newborn, but my son has grown into his mustache quite well! :) Love it!"
My son's teeth were changing as a result of chewing on his regular (big) pacifier.  Started using the Mam with the smaller neck and his teeth and bite are normalizing.  Thanks Mam!
My three month old son loves his wubbanub. In fact its the only one he will use. So glad I found it.
Got this for my nephew.  It is a real conversation starter when he has it in.  People love it and so does he
He loves these things to death and won't let them go we own about 8 of them know and the baby is a year and he is tickled to death easy to find and super easy to clean. These are a must for any parent or grandparent!!!!!!!
"I believe we have ordered this wubbanub monkey about 4 times. My daughter has loved wubbanubs since she was born (she is 2-1/2 now) and the monkey is her favorite. since she does have a full set of teeth the pacifier will get cracks in it and we cannot give it to her anymore. We just order another one and she doesn't know the difference. She has also had the wubbanub duck, giraffe and baby doll. When the pacifier got a hole and needed to be removed from the baby I just detached it and now the baby is her favorite thing in the world."
"I first thought this was a silly idea, but it has been wonderful. Baby holds the elephant and the elephant holds the pacifier in place, plus is big enough you can find it if it is dropped.  Get 2 - one for the car or diaper bag and one for home."
It's amazing!!! It's So soft and the colors are so bright!!! It Matches clothes! :) I would totally recommend it!
"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt compelled on this one.  We REALLY wanted to find a single piece pacifier that the baby could chew on, and it would not mold/mildew like normal paci's.  They were easy to find for 0-6mo, but not over 6mo.  THESE ARE PERFECT for over 6mos.  ONE PIECE, EASY TO CLEAN, NO MOLD/MILDEW, DURABLE, CAN CHEW ON ALL SIDES.  And a bonus is that is looks like they have a pink or blue 'smile' all the time.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!"
I bought these for my daughter's baby she loves them. wants to get more. cant go wrong if you buy these.
My aunt and uncles favorite team so I thought it might be a good idea to get it for the baby boy that I can't wait for
My grandson has 2 of the WubbaNub pacifiers and he loves to fondle the soft animal as he comforts himself with the pacifier.
I bought it  for my 7month baby girl.<br />Color is so lovely and nice design :)<br />It's better than I expected.
"I'm so glad to find something natural- I don't know if the baby will actually like pacifiers.  My first didn't, but that has nothing to do with this product.  Please keep making these!"
They were the perfect gift for my aunts baby that is not born yet and I can't wait to see be born
These are wonderful because it allows my baby to grasp it better than just a pacifier. If she misses the pacifier part she can gum the legs and she likes looking at the different colors.
"We tried many different pacifiers, shapes and sizes. This pacifier is the best, especially for chubby cheeked babies! It doesn't leave grooves in her cheeks and I love that we don't have to worry about the pacifier being upside down during car rides and sleep time. Glow in the dark ring is helpful too, plus anything glow in the dark is always cooler!  I bought another pack and im ready with the 6-18 month size too!"
"This is the only paci my baby will use!! I love how soft they are, they don't get lost as easy, and my son can hold on to the animal. It was hard to pick which animal because they're all so cute, but we got both monkeys and couldn't be happier. Bought one for my daughters teacher whose expecting too."
"I know that that's not what they're supposed to be used for but hey! It worked for me. These are much less expensive and you get so many more than acutaly Breast Pump Wipes. Also, I feel like these are a better size for a breast pump wipe. That's what I used them for since I pumped about 3 times a day. I would use a wipe after each use and then at the end of the day I would wash all the parts. WITHOUT breaking the bank. Those other wipes are very expensive and you don't get as many."
"Cute binky.<br /><br />However, my baby doesn't like this type of nipple. He always rejects this. Not taking off any stars because of that. All in all this binky/pacifier is cute"
These are my daughter's favorite binkies. She is 5 months old and it fits on her well and the colors are fun.
"The Mam Air pacifiers are our son's favorite! There is no top or bottom, so it's great when he finds it in the middle of the night. They are cute too. I love how I can see he little smile through the open pacifier."
"Wubbanubs are great. Help keep the pacifier with the baby, if they spit the out or pull them out they tend to stay in the carrier and not roll and bounce out and get lost."
I have 5 kids and didn't discover these until my last child.  These are just as discribed.  Life saver at night... no midnight dark searching for the pacifier it is easy to find in the dark:)  Now my daughter is old enough and we don't have to help she finds it all by herself.  Love this thing!
excellent product preference my son to use and easy to wash comes in assorted colors really very cheap good good
My 4 month old adores this. He is able to easily get the soother to his mouth as well. Super soft and the soother seems very secure.
"These are the only pacifiers that our little one will use.  They're great and inexpensive, so it's no big deal if you lose one, which will happen."
These have become a childhood classic for our 4 children. All have had their own WubbaNub and they are the best pacifiers we've bought by far. And the red dragon was an excellent choice for our youngest boy named Raistlin.
I was this and just had to get it.  I love the pink on it for my daughter.  I got a lot of laughs and cute pictures with this.  It seems to be comfortable for my daughter too
They were exactly what I was hoping they would be. Definitely would recommend then to someone else in the future.
"I had a hard time getting my baby to take a pacifier, but we had the most success with this one, and it didn't leave marks on her face like the plastic ones did."
"My newborn absolutely loves his Wubbanubs! We received the monkey as a shower gift, but needed an extra one since he uses it so often. He loves to hold onto the animal, which helps keep the paci in his mouth. I highly, highly recommend this product!"
"Those pacifiers are amazing ,<br />I have been buying them for all kid who I know.<br />Highly recommend,<br />Thank you"
"Everyone loves this thing, especially our son. Our little boy gets lots of compliments when he uses it... &#34;I love his binkie&#34;...&#34;That's the coolest pacifier&#34;. Long lasting, Eventually the MUSTACHE WILL COME LOOSE...WHEN IT DOES THROW IT AWAY because it becomes a choking hazard. Otherwise, it's a winner."
Sometimes this pacifier is the only thing that can calm down our 4-months-old. We try not to leave home without it!
This is the one my daughter picked out for her new baby boy. Its adorable. My granddaughter has a giraffe one and she loves it. I hope my grandson will too.
"Love it! Much easier for me to keep up with and he can hold it while he uses pacifier. I have two, so I can wash one and he still can play with one"
The product complied with the characteristics described on the site. The material is soft and allows to keep the baby calm when placed.
Received these WubbaNub pacifiers very quickly and they are so cute and adorable !  They were the last pacifier one of my granddaughters would take and she is adorable holding on to them !
This bear is so cute !!!  This is a fantastic product and I would recommend for babies!  My granddaughter thoroughly enjoys this WubbaNub and is the only kind of paci she will take !
"My daughter has been a wubbanub lover from the day she was born, and just like all of the others she has had she loves the adorable owl just as much as the other one's.  I have recommended this product to all of my friends and family members who are expecting!"
"So funny and great, giving as a gift!  Can't wait till they see it and the little one gets here!"
"Switched to these pacis after using the other Nuk made out of the hard plastic on the outside. Our daughter doesn't get those marks on her cheeks now because of how nice and flexible these are. Also, this doesn't have that big ring on the outside, so it's harder for her to accidentally pull it out and saves her that frustration. And, because it's basically all one piece, there aren't those nooks and crannies for fuzz and stuff to get caught, which makes cleaning them much easier."
"Why didn't anybody tell me about these? I love the way that they hang onto your diaper bag strap. They' re semi-transparent, which is convenient. I wish that I had known about these when my grandson was a newborn."
Everything about this transaction was great.  I bought this as a gift for a co-worker's baby shower.  She loves vampire shows and obviously loved this.
The only pasafier my baby will take to. Stops him from crying. Love the green color and it washes well in dishwasher
These are great and we love the 49ers out daughter loves them and the sports ones are the only ones she will use she will not even touch other brands even though we have tried.
These things are so great.  They help keep the pacifier in my babies mouth when sleeping and in the car seat.  Plus they are a soft toy for them to hold on to.  I wish that I had known of them with my first kid.  I used to sleep with my hand in the bassent to keep her pacifier in.  With the second kid I just propped the animal next to her and wala!  Stayed in 80% of the time.  I buy them for all of friends that are expecting.
"Super cute! Seems to be well made. Bought it as a baby shower gift. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but then again, it needs to be small for babies :)"
"My nephew who is 6months loves this pacifier. I brought him a monkey one and he loved it, so I had to get him another one. He wont leave home without it!! Well worth the price!"
My son loves this pacifier.  I bought the super soothie and he didn't like it as much so I bought this one and he JUST LOVES IT
Before we got this were were always losing pacifiers. Usually in the car. A friend recommended WubbaNub to us and we are so grateful.  My son loves it. It's soft and very easy for him to hold.
"We bought it for our daughter right after we came home from the hospital, where we got one of these for free. It really is the best pacifier!"
"this gate is great. it is so hard to find a regular tension gate for wide doorways.  this one also works well in regular doorways.  it fits snug and the tension points are well above base molding, which helps to secure a tight even fit."
"these don't leak, they have minimal parts so they're easy to clean, kids can't bite & ruin spout. they've also held up over time. i'm ordering more because im tossing all his other sippies that leak or have been ruined from his teeth. you won't be disappointed in these!"
"this was such a handy tool for feeding my baby. in fact, it was the only way she would allow me to feed her. i figured that the steady flow of food was just her preference since she has had a very hearty appetite since she came into the world. it was quick and simple and the cleaning was a breeze."
"we have high chair and this bebepod, but use this chair every time - it is way easier. started at 7m."
"bought as a baby shower gift for some one living in oregon and i live in minnesota , she had a on line shower , it worked , and she was thrilled, good idea"
"started cloth diapering at around three weeks and seven pounds. my baby still too small for full use of diaper, but with an extra fold in front these fit just fine. the diaper is wet, but the baby is not uncomfortable. we use this with the thirsties covers. i not only recommend it, but will be buying the next size up when baby outgrows size one."
it solved my life time problems where to put all this toys. thanks god someone came up to this idea. i love it.
my baby is not born yet but soooo cute and im sure it will wrap her up nice and snug!
this blanket was more than i expected it was thick and nice and just what i needed for my baby while traveling g thanks
Amazing!!!! Beautiful!!! Sparkly!!!! Look better than the actual picture!!!! Very happy and satisfied with the product!! I definitely recommend these butterflies to anyone!!
"It is soft and perfect for little fingers.  Will have to wait to see how it washes, since giving as a gift."
I have several of these pacifiers and the baby can hold on to them easily and they are very cute!
this us the most affordable thing i have ever seen! it is everything the description says and more. it arrived as promised and was packed very well.
"we had the previous generation of this monitor with the recharging bases. those units functioned for 3 years, but the batteries would not hold a charge after a few months on the base units (we went through several replacement batteries before giving up on the units). the new design gets rid of the recharging bases, which has so far (1+ year) resulted in improved battery life and monitor functionality. very happy we decided to go back to the graco as it has good range with basic functionality."
"this is the first new system i've owned, and am very pleased with it  features are hard to figure out though."
the only bibs for age 2 and up! it catches everything and my toddler and child can scoop up their lost food and eat it by themselves! so easy to clean and sturdy.
"this seems to be my 7 month old grandsons favorite toy, he loves to pop it in his mouth to help his teething gums, and laughs to the music it plays. if he starts squirming too much during a diaper change, i just hand him his baby einstein and he holds still!"
"every parent with a standard snack container asks me about this one. the lid makes so much of a difference -- keep the food fresh and avoid spills or leaks or cheerio dust from getting all over diaper bag when tot isn't eating. it's great that the lid is tethered to the cup, and it's very clever that the tether becomes a handle for the child when the lid is off and the child is eating. when it's time to close it up, the handle &#34;disappears&#34; and it's more compact in your bag.<br /><br />i spent a long time trying to figure out which snack container to buy and i am so glad i found these."
"this is by far the best investment thus far i have made. i am a mom of 3 and i purchased this for our newest addition. she was colicky in the beginning and at times this was the only way i could get things done around the house. now that she's a bit older, we still use it every week for our grocery trip at minimum.  she snuggles right in and within 15 minutes, she's asleep."
"i ordered this because i was becoming nervous about using my iphone for white noise and other calming sounds for my newborn. i know there isn't much research to support that electronic devices (cellular devices) cause cancer, but for me it was worth the money in exchange for peace of mind. this machine has a great battery life. we take it everywhere and play it often and still haven't needed to replace the batteries. it goes in the stroller with us and in the car at least 3 times a week."
this item is an excellent quality and were very useful. the style was one that my daughter loved for the grandbaby.
"if you get out of the house at all, you should get this! unless you just want to hold your baby in you lap while he grabs at your food and everything else you have within reaching distance!<br /><br />it was easy to use. i had no problem setting it up or taking it down. a friend saw me trying to figure out how to raise it (without reading the directions, haha) and showed me how, even though he had never seen one before. so i'd say most people should have no problem, especially if they read the directions."
"so nice, big, cuddly and soft, i used all during my pregnancy and even after. i absolutely love it!!!! =)"
"my 27 month old does so well with this! he used to get up many times a night, now he stays in bed most nights :)"
these worked great for my twins.  i was able to use it with them before 9 lbs due to the velcro.
my daughter absolutely loves her wubba nubs an she was delighted to recieve ella bella the pink elephant adorable wubba nub
bought these to use on my baby to wipe his little bum.  works great!  it is soft and absorbent and cleans up well without having to use multiple cloth wipes.  bought 2 sets and its the perfect amount of wipes..as we wash every other day.  i will probably purchase another pack of wipes just to use to clean up his face after his meals.
we purchased these for wrestling pins for &#34;pins&#34; for a pin. they were very nice quality and arrived on time. they got held up by the weather delays in shipment but the vendor had sent them on time.
i love this! it's so soft! i wish i had one of these sheets for my bed. my little man likes to rub his face on it while he falls asleep.
"Wonderful dcor for our granddaughter's room,, done in dragon flies and woodland animals.  we got a yellow and green one also arrived in a quick manner she loves it."
Great! Fast delivery and my baby loved it! The Best one I've tried. The sad part are the brazilian taxes. They are more expensive than pacifiers.
"This wubbanub is awesome like all wubbanubs, but I like this one because it matches baby girl's wardrobe the most. I feel the safest with these over loose junkies because she fits the whole binky in her mouth and I worry about choking, but with these I feel good enough to leave her sleep with."
Our twin girls love them! They provide comfort for them when in the crib. One of their favorite toys as well.
We own many wubbas and this is by far the cutest! We love wubbas they are big so we never loose them and our daughter can always find it
"With our first baby, he was always losing his binky and we were always buying more and finding them later on. This product allows us to always keep track of it and she LOVES pulling the elephant head up to her mouth to keep the binky in place. Absolutely adorable!"
"I bought this for my son because i thought it would be funny. And it was. He really likes it too, it's one of his favorites :)"
I purchased several different pacifiers and this type was my daughters favorite and she kept in her mouth much better than other brands that look similar.
"Wubanubs are AWESOME! When you first bring the baby home, you can use the legs of the stuffed animal to prop the pacie so that it stays in your baby's mouth. They are also great for traveling as the weight helps to keep them in. With our now 6 month old, she can play with it as well. We keep a few around the house. And they are washable! We recommend them to everyone!"
Have used these since my baby girl was born and she loves them. And worth mentioning they are also very cute !
Cutest pacifier on the market. Any picture I take of my son with this binky makes me melt. I want to buy the other styles too :)
"My daughter is obsessed with these, and used the 0-3month kind constantly, although I was against using them at first.  They don't mess up latching or feeding at all, which is lucky, and she feels very soothed by these.  They are soft and seem to always look new and not chewed up ever.  She uses them constantly, so that is impressive."
We currently have 4 of these. Here is what's great about these. When they fall out of your child's mouth it conventionally sits right below their mouth so they can get the wub back ion there mouth them self. It is also easy for them to see and grab onto. My daughter throws her around and plays with it. It's a toy and bink in one :)<br /><br />LOVE these..Buy one don't wait :)
"Love these pacifiers! They appear not to allow as much moisture inside the nipple, which is why we were replacing the MAM ones we had. Hubby loves the sports theme and I can often find a coordinating pacifier while the two guys are watching a game."
"my baby has had this wubb from when he was a week old, he's now almost 8 months. we love it. we always get complements about how cute it is. it is very convenient because its so big, its easier for our baby to find it on his own when he loses it in his crib"
"i purchased these trays after using hard ice cube trays made for baby food. these are great! i just run a little hot water over the bottom and pop them right out into the freezer bags. don't fill the tray all the way, though, or the lid won't go on quite right."
my grandson couldn't stop using his music box and he's a great dancer.  he's a sesame street characters lover and elmo happens to be his favorite
"my sister in-law lives in nyc and instead of carrying around a sheet or some other product to take to the park for her 5 months old. this was a great product. its small, you can wash it, use it outdoors if you are in the park or beach. i would recommend this product."
i got this book for my sister in law. its very cute. there are plenty of pages to fill with baby info. highly recommend this book
i ordered this and two days later i got it in the mail! it is for my daughter. i loved how it was packaged. everything is perfect. i didn't think i'd get it that fast. and it was really cheap!!
this is adorable! it is soft and very well made. the perfect addition to any jungle or safari nursery. i'm so glad i purchased this!
used this my whole pregnancy and it worked wonderfully as i needed something for leverage. now it serves as my back support for my middle-of- the -night nursing feedings.
grandson loves his mat. was very happy with the item. will order more for the other grandkids  thanks do much
he is a tractor/truck boy and this really made mealtime fun and easy to keep him at the table and focused on the meal
"i expected a more breathable texture, but for this price ($150), it is super padded and looks sturdy. heavy for sure, but guys, we get used to lift heavy stuff with baby coming. whatever, we'll put the car seat in the stroller  so... weight is not a big deal. after all, if you plan to have a c-section and weight matter, think that after a month, your strength would be back, and during that time, you could leave the car seat in the car."
I bought this for my baby shower after searching for a long time. I just wanted something simple and this one was the perfect one. I got a lot of compliments and my mother approved. Im glad I got it.
grandson and he has loved it!  it lights up the sky with stars and is a fun toy to place with too!
"love it.....have tried softbums, g-diaper,grovia,kawaii.....a little pricey`but quality is worth it. i have a few omni's and some of the cheaper ones so i can alternate without having to wear out my softbums by using everyday. hold in leaks/blowouts on my 5 month old great. love that you can insert more or less inserts. great product!!"
love how versatile this is to keep toddlers either in or out of a specific room. we use it to keep our toddler out of a room that's not totally childproof.
"the method that i used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and didn't allow for pull ups.  (it worked well!)  about a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  i was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when i found this.  turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once i got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  i wish i had known about this when i first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  it is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  i now have this off of her bed again, but i can't say enough good stuff about this product."
"i bought these for my 7 yr grand daughter for christmas and she loved them!  i was afraid they would only fit babies-but they fit her just fine.  she had a taller, more slender build but they're cute as they can be!"
"works great for my 15 month old, should have bought them sooner!! my son started refusing to be spoon fed at times but will take these pouches :) after a couple uses i find them easy to fill and clean and i love that i can feed my son healthy food that i have made. i hesitated to buy these and am so glad i did, they have paid for themselves in the few weeks we have been using them!"
these are the new favorites in my house! he loves the shapes and i love the way they use so much of the bread! little waste!!!
"very attractive look, easy to install, my husband installed one so that the gate swings both ways, which was perfect!"
i never believed inthe warmers until i got one of these. it's so simple to use. i use it daily and even bought another one fo rmy best friend she loves her. it quicky heats the water for my sons bottle. and what i loved was it shuts off by it'self.
"this product was just released so i have only used it for two days. my baby seems to love it! i have tried other noise machines in the past, however, they usually play the sound on a 5-10 second loop. i can always detect the loop and it drives my crazy. this machine does not do that. the sounds are actually soothing. reminds me of a spa. here is my pro and cons list for this product.<br /><br />pros:<br />-great sounds<br />-love how the mirror has little light-ups on it<br />-soft for the baby<br />-changes colors from blue to green<br />-love the stars effect on the ceiling<br />-easy installation<br /><br />cons:<br />-the stars only cover approx 10sqft of the ceiling. i guess this is just enough to cover the ceiling above the crib but i wish there were more bc my baby looks around.<br />-room must be completely dark to see the stars on the ceiling. this is not an issue at night, but nap time during the day may be an issue<br />-poor speaker placement. the speaker is on the back of the unit. if the unit is attached to a wooden crib, the rails can cover the speaker and cause distortion. this could be resolved by brica by moving the speaker to the top or bottom or the unit.<br /><br />although there are a few cons, i would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sound machine/projector."
"these are so easy and so convenient! they hold up very well. a lot of strength for their small size, which is great because it doesn't get in the way of folding up the stroller. 2 pack was nice, i got one on each stroller."
keeps your young one safe and entertained.  multiple toys and features makes this an outstanding value.  the unit is bright and colorful.
"my son began sitting up very early and we were looking for a product that would give him adequate support, but was age appropriate. he was to young for the swing and didn't enjoy the infant seat. this product was perfect! it encouraged good sitting posture and provided the right amount of support for him. it also kept him entertained longer than similar products (i.e. baby swing, infant seat, bouncy seat) that we purchased. once my son outgrew it, we gave it to a family friend and her son loves it as well. i would definitely recommend this product!"
i first came across this when a friend told me her son's ot recommended it as one of the best toys to get your kid. now i'm sold. my little one loves it because it's light and easy to hold for her. it's also great for when you have another slightly older toddler with a love of throwing things as hard as he can and a new baby in the house :) (in other words - it's soft/flexible)
i was happily surprised how well these shades work and clings to the windows.  there are no suctions and it doesn't impair the vision as much as i thought it would.  i am going to buy a few more for the rear window.
i have twin baby grandchildren and these really fit the bill.  they cover everything and have a velcro closure  at the back of the neck.  their arms slip through so shoulders are covered....this bib really works
"my cousin bought this for our first baby and we hadn't even thought of brushing gums/first teeth so it wasn't on our registry or anything. it was very nice and gentle on her teeth, and she is already well-trained at brushing teeth by 2 years old. i think it helps to start early."
great waterproof bib. the scrunch collar to prevent dribbles is brilliant! the bib is soft and machine washable with micro-fiber terry cloth front and a waterproof polyester back.
i love my bags. some of the reviews silly. i've been using the bags for my daughter and newborn son and it's great
looks great! works great! being able to swing both ways and close by itself are great features. i would highly recommend this product.
i love this monitor. it works perfect so we can keep our eyes on our little girl while she sleeps
"purchased this item to install on the corners of my outdoor grill. the edges are not rounded, so every year i have to buy a new cover. this will solve my yearly problem."
we are very pleased with the set. the pillows could used a bit more stuffing but everything else looks great. the wall hangings were bigger than i thought and that is a plus.
"we have 2 toddlers under 3 years old. one of them has no interest in the oven. the other one seems to be constantly attracted by it. our oven is some italian brand and the other safety devices i tried on it did not work well. this one took some creativity to install too, because the gap between the oven door and the body was a little too small, but in the end i was able to find a place to put and it fit like a glove. i could not have hoped for a better product for the purpose. &#34;thank you&#34; to whoever designed this thing."
"absolutely love this product! i wish i had it with my 1st two kids.  with my 3rd i exclusively pump and this is a life saver.  im able to work, drive, read, feed baby, put baby to sleep, etc... all while i am pumping.  this is great and is so easy to use, holds well and is super comfy.  will recommend this to everyone.  also, i use a medela pump in style, no issues."
it pushes great.  its light.  is folds better then the single if you take off the wheels.  it was worth every penny.
this works great for bottles and other small opening containers! i like its stand for by the sink so it can dry off too!
my daughter carries these around all day! no mess and easy for the little ones to snack at their convenience!
the base is a great feature. it prevents the brush from touching random surfaces. the brush sits wherever you want it. it is easily washable. the brush itself is of great quality. it held up perfectly for 14 months of bottle washing.<br /><br />i am now purchasing a second one for my second baby and one as a gift.
"my 4year old daughter has limited range of motion in her legs and this stroller works really well. i was searching for a stroller that was comfortable for an older child and not too bulky. we have a jogging stroller that works well but is heavy and awkward to take in the car. this stroller is perfect and the leg rest is sturdy and soft on her legs, while in the up position."
"this is small, sturdy, and great for the price.  it takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some.  i would recommend this over some of the fancier ones.  it does the job well."
"i love the pillow and the fact that the blanket is bigger so she can cover her self better, easy to roll it up and light weight for her to cary it with the handle - perfect for my 3 yr old ( it was a hit at her school sleep over )"
"Perfect for our 2.5 y/o. She takes it to church, we even put extra clothes, coloring books and her snacks :)"
My grandson owns about every wubbanub & he loves them! We didn't care for the fur in the ears. Still love it!
"These orthodontic pacifier work great, our 1 month old grandson did not like the ones from the hospital, but he loves these.."
"Arrived within 2 days, which was awesome.  (Was not a prime purchase) Such a great shower gift for the baseball loving couple.  Very cute"
This is even cuter in person.  I bought a couple for new baby boys and girls. Great pics are guaranteed and the baby liked it too.
Love the Wubbanubs! These are great for child development & hand eye coordination. If my son wakes he can feel around and find this then soothe himself back to sleep. It's also easier for me to find in the middle of the night. Always buy a back up... they get attached to these and if you lose it you might a have problem! ;)
"My daughter uses it, ask her. But you'll have to wait a while she can't talk. It's pacifier people it is what it is. Quality is good and the soother is just like the ones you take home from the hospital."
"My daughter (now 3) has been using these since she was a newborn. The other pacifiers would fall right out of her mouth (cue screaming baby in the middle of the night), but these seemed to stay in...This has been her favorite pacifier by far, so I bought it for our 2nd baby on the way. She never had a problem with it creating a ring around her face.<br />The colors I received are blue and green (as pictured), and they were translucent, not opaque like the other Nuk pacifiers I have seen. Perfect for the price!"
What a cute lil invention. Got this for my 1 year old and he at first gave a weird reaction but after that he was okay. It looks too cute on him. He has brown hair as well so the mustache goes perfect with his hair color ;)
My daughter loves these pacifiers - they do not push against her nose and have a perfect texture (both soft/gummy and firm). They are easy to clean as I just throw them on the top rack of the dishwasher. I also like that the nipple part is hollow - you can easily put your finger in it to ensure a crying baby doesn't spit the pacifier out right away.
my daughter tried many didn't kinds of pacifiers and this is his favorite..he is 8 months old and it is his go to. good quality also.
"I think this is priced a little bit high, but it is worth the money. My grandson, age 3 months, loves this."
Very great for price. Will accommodate 2-3 wet cloth diapers if needed or a few suits! Great purchase over all!
"NUK pacifiers have worked the best with both of my babies, when other pacifiers were rejected. (And I spent a lot of money on various brands). They are durable and last a long time..and the ring make is convenient to hold on your finger or use with a pacifier clip. The only thing is that they are sometimes hard to clean. When you use soap and water, it gets inside the nipple. In order to get it out, you have to cup your hand with water while squeezing the nipple. This gets some water inside to wash the soap out. After that, I always throw them in the sanitizer. Not a big deal. I will continue to buy NUKs!"
"Bought this for a friend's baby.  They were excited to receive it because they were looking for it, and couldn't find it anywhere else!  It's soooooooo cute!"

"Totally grand! My grandson is so very happy with his new &#34;Ellie&#34; and so am I. As always, Amazon is my go-to marketplace for all my shopping needs."
Glow in the dark is great for in the middle of the night! My son loves these and so do I!

"When my grandson's old WubbaNub Monkey got befriended by the neighbor's dogs, it was a sad event. But Amazon to the rescue-and the old was replaced with a new WubbaNub monkey!! These WubbaNubs are so cute and people comment on them all the time during an outing. What a cute way to hold a pacifier. I highly recommend WubbaNubs! They are soothing for babies and very much loved by them."
"We've used the Wubbanub pacifier since our child was a newborn. He loves to cuddle with the stuffed animal. Now that he's older, he easily puts the paci back in his mouth. He also loves to chew on the toy as well. It's so easy to wash and I love that I can throw it in a mesh laundry bag in the washer. We have been using the pacifier with the lamb and decided that we definitely need a second!"
"Bought moustachifiers for all baby boys we know, super cute great little gift.  Tried all 3 versions and all very cute."
"A friend let us try out one of these pacifiers after we stocked up on the &#34;soothies,&#34; which he refused to use.  He likes these and still uses the same style at 1 year (we didn't buy the older type).  He only uses them for sleep.  The glow-in-the-dark feature is nice but doesn't last the night."
My baby transitioned from the newborn pacifier to these without any issues.  She was fine with the size 2 or size 3 but I guess it depends on you kid.  Mine was fine with either.
"We have used the WubbaNub pacifier since the day our baby girl was born and she took to it immediately. Because she is a breastfed baby, we weren't sure if a pacifier would hinder her ability to breastfeed properly. We gave her the WubbaNub anyways, it was too cute not to try! She has never had &#34;nipple confusion&#34;. She enjoyed her &#34;Mr. Binks&#34; as well lovingly call it, and it has become her comfort item. I've listed the pro's and con's below.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The stuffed animal attached to the pacifier keeps it from getting lost when it falls out of baby's mouth. Many a times, I've been driving when it falls out of the baby's mouth and I can easily reach back and find it because of the stuffed animal being attached.<br />-Baby &#34;pets&#34; the animal during sleep transitions to sooth herself to sleep<br />-Lays flat on baby's chest, keeping it in their mouth even when they are newborn and don't have great &#34;suction&#34; yet<br />-Many different stuffed animal options and they are all so cute<br />-difficult to lose because of the size (they don't fall out and disappear under the couch!)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Difficult to wash just the pacifier<br />-Wish the pacifier was detachable so that it could be swapped out for the different stages<br /><br />Overall, our baby has loved this pacifier from day one. We don't have many complaints and I love that we get so many compliments on how cute it is!"
Coming home from the hospital I was wondering how easy it would be to find the same pacifier they use there. My first child would not take his pacifier at all. I ran across these on Amazon that looked like they matched what we were given in the hospital and they do match up perfectly. Our second loves his pacifier and these things seem to keep him pretty happy!
Unfortunately these are no longer available in stores.  We had to buy them on Amazon and then have a friend bring them to us in New Zealand....but a parent will do anything to help a baby sleep.  :)
Pacis are exactly as described! Cannot go wrong with these! The same ones they give you in the hospital except pink and purple! So adorable for a girl!
I lovethis it look great and I love the price and fast service!!! I am very happy and recommend it to everybody as a gift for a little boy
I only wish these weren't so expensive because my daughter is an addict to this style.  I love that they glow in the dark and look super cute in the mouth.  We've always used these pacis with all three of our kids and they are great.
"My grandson already has one and I bought one just &#34;incase&#34;.  Thank good ness I did, because it temporarily got lost, so its good to have an extra.....also when washing one you have another one to use.  He loves his &#34;binkie&#34;!"
I bought this for my 4mo old grandson. He looks even more adorable when he's sucking; I just cant keep my eyes off of him. Sizing was also perfect.
"Our niece loved these, so it was the first go-to for our baby girl and she loved them as well!"
"Great item, pretty color I bought 2, I bought a camo clip to go with so it looks great with it. My Sonny takes it sometime but it's just him not the pacifier.  I Like the material and that it has a hole where I can stick the clip loop in unlike the ones that come from hospital and I like how it forms around the face unlike the ones from hospital that are circular."
Needed extra just in case one falls and I can't wash it right away or if one gets lost. :p
"these are teh best pacifier creations ever my grandson now has 2 and he loves them , these will be great gifts for ppl having babies and such a variety to choose from. i will be purchasing many more."
"I keep buying these for my friends that are expecting.  The ones that use them immediately love them. Babies are soothed and think mom is next to them because of the heart beat recording.  If they wait to give baby the teddy bear then the heart beat doesn't do much and you just have a regular teddy bear, nice but not what we wanted."
"I have two pairs of these for my 5 month old. He loves them best! He likes to watch them glow in the mirror and sleeps with them until they pop out due to him sleeping with his mouth wide open. I wish I had these for my older children when they were infants. They're easy to find in a dark room or even a dark car. I love the brand of pacifier. It is the only kind my 3 children would use. The others were uncomfortable and made them cry. I didn't even bother trying any other brand with my youngest, but my husband did and regretted not listening. My husband will even  finds them amazing and helpful for when he gets up every so often to help my son fall asleep."
My babies love wubbanubs.  It helps little ones find the pacifier at night and a cute stuffy. No more lost pacifiers in crib.
Really love these. They came in a timely manner and i like how the nipple has the hollowed out portion.  It may make it easier to get rid of her pacifiers.
"These are of really good quality, small and let air around the mouth.  I am happy to recommend this product and would definitely purchase again."
"We love this pacifier. It's adorable and the owl is super soft. Our baby is just starting to grab things, and having the stuffed animal helps keep the pacifier in (sort of!) and gives baby something to grab to try to push the paci back into his mouth. (Or grab it out of his mouth, depending on how his arms are flailing...)"
This is my grandson' s favorite pacifier!  Having the stuffed animal attached makes it easy for him to hold on to it.  They also make a great baby gift!!!
"We loved your product and it's use has brought many smiles to friends who have seen his picture.  It's a cute idea and any time you can make people smile with so little effort, well I think you should. He had no trouble adapting to this pacifier and he was already using one, so it's not like we forced him to use something he didn't need. Thanks for the product."
Super cute and good quality pacifier. Will order again as these are my favorite. Definitely recommend them to anyone looking!
My daughter loves these! They are great at night when she can't find her binkie and starts crying. They are cute well made and parent friendly. The age limit is 0-6 months. She is 6 months now and has really started liking it. I have no plans to take it away from her unless it becomes a choking issue.
Was so very tickled to find a wubbanub tiger to put in my daughter's hope chest.  We are all LSU tiger fans and I just love the little tiger wub!!
Adorable and hilarious.  Got it as a gift and the newly proud parents love it.  I thought it would be a good gag gift but they use it all the time.
"My 4 month old loves her Wubbanub and this one is just too adorable! If it's not in her mouth, she's cuddling with it or playing with it. Definitely one of our best purchases."
"My 4 month old loves her Wubbanubs! She has the yellow ducky and the Mary Meyer giraffe. When she's not using the paci, she's cudding with the little stuffed animal, especially when she sleeps. And now she's figuring out how to put it back in her mouth if it falls out. So cute!"
"EBF newborn took to this pacifier quickly and easily . . . 4 months later still prefers Dr. Brown's over any others!  Small nipple size is the key, I think."
These are the only pacifiers my baby likes the feel of AND can't rip apart! I tried like every other kind under the sun!
"I gave this to my 2-month-old nephew for Christmas.  Not only is it adorable, but it is his FAVORITE pacifier.  He loves it, and we love watching him use it!"
"No little chocking parts, my daughter loves his. She can sleep with this on top of her and when she spits it out the pacifier stays where it is. Very easy for her to grab as well and cleans easily in a mesh bag. Now own multiple of these and very happy with them."
Great pacifier and the only one my baby likes. Soft plastic and BPA free got one from the hospital but needs more
"I initially order one for my son, since he love it, I ended up ordering several more as gifts for friends and family.<br />it s easy to wash, and keep clean jut brought it in the wasting aching and that is it.<br />I highly recommend this toy-pacifier."
I bought this for my niece and she loves it! I would recommend to every mom to buy two just in case you leave one at grandmas house. She is six months old and takes it with her wherever she goes!
Love this cute &#34;toy&#34; that replaces the need for multiple pacifiers.  No longer does a mom have to retrieve the pacifier dropped or thrown by her toddler...and then find a way to clean it before giving it back to the fussy baby!
My daughter hate pacifiers but she love this. She just chews every part of it. And it makes her super happy.
With the glow in the dark pacifiers my daughter can now find her pacifier in the dark and put it back in her mouth so I don have to get out of bed an help. It wonderful!!!
Very funny and grey gift idea for a newborn. It is as described and I would definitely buy again. Thanks
She can snuggle the bear and it helps keep binki in her mouth plus no else has the pink bear great purchase
this mattress was the perfect solution to increase comfort for times when our baby sleeps in the pack n play.  excellent fit and quality.
"this is a great product, our 6 mth old loves it. the tray snaps on securely and removes easily. clean up is a one wipe job and its deep enough that spillage stays in the tray!"
"these bags are perfect if you use 100% biodegradable diapers... yes they do exist!! check out the bamboo diapers here on amazon, the owner will even send you a trial if requested. the diapers are so amazingly soft, plush, and effective that i sort of wish i still peed my pants.<br /><br />but yeah, these bags are a great accompaniment because we can throw our diapers in a biodegradable bag, throw it into the trashcan for the garbage men to pick up and without any special effort we are saving the world!!<br /><br />(sidenote - the bamboo diapers are quite expensive, but i think it is worth it considering the economic impact of disposable diapers)"
these bottles and pacifiers are such a life saver i haven't been able to find a good bottle that works with him but these work great!
These are great no more lost binky they are so cute get lot of people asking where I got them.  Our little one just loves them and so does her mom when sleeping she will wake and feel for it and right back to sleep they are just the right size for her little hand and when Doctor seen them she said they were great for her hand and eye coronation so they are a win win there could not think of anything bad to say about these so worth the money
"Good quality item, indicating brings photo. I highly recommend it, for the price it is a very good bargain =)."
These are the best things ever.  I only wish they had been around when my kids were small.  We now have 4.
"Our little girl is two months old. We tried different kinds of pacifiers but she always had trouble holding them in her mouth until this one. No more worried about her pacifier falling out, so happy!"
Thank you for fast & easy service. Purchased as a shower gift & I know they'll be appreciated. Product is as described. Very happy with all.
Perfect pacifier it was my daughters favorite she loved them and it kept them germ free when she dropped them at home I would recommend keeping it if my baby dropped in public but perfect for home
The friend I bought it for loved it! I know her son will love it too when he is born :)
"My son's daycare turned us on to these pacifiers--they are the best! He started using them when he was 4.5 months old. They stay in much better than soothies, and he loves them!"
"My daughter absolutely adores her wubbanub!! The giraffe is super cute.. At first I thought it was a bit small in size, but later realize it is the perfect size for an infant to hang on to."
Best pacifiers there is out there. My daughter is breast feed and she loves these. Amazing product and easy to clean!
"I bought this for an aunt who is legally blind. This glows RED if she has a fever, so she knows then to call someone to read it for her. It might not sound like much -- unless you can barely see. What a great product. Thanks so much."
"This product is great. It stays shut, is easy to clean and holds 2 paci's with paci clips. Only complaint is that the loop is open on one side so if it is moved or bumped in just the right way it can come off what every you have it looped too. I would have preferred it was a clip instead."
My daughter absolutely loves these. They are soft & perfect gor little hsnds to grip. We have gone through several of them. Some were lost & the nipple on some got worn down due to frequent use.
"We were given two Wubbanubs when we were in the NICU with my twins and I immediately purchased two more once I realized how great they are.  I've bought them for everyone I know who's had a baby ever since.  They're cute, functional and so much easier to keep track of than just a pacifier all by itself.  I don't know about you, but when my kids drop a pacifier it always bounces under a piece of furniture or someplace else I can't reach.  These just fall to the floor and it's a cinch to grab it with my toes without even bending over.  (Yeah, fine, judge all you want, but I've got twins and you do what you have to.)  I totally recommend these and I will continue to buy them for anyone I know who's having a baby."
New born baby all the way to my current 1yr old who still loves the lamb.  I am going to buy more from friends.
This product is amazing. Little smaller than i thought but i will buy more for sure. Thank you so much.
"My baby loves these pacifiers. he rejected the pacifiers that were given in the hospital and that are attached to all the wubanubs (you know which one I'm talking about). He just spits them right out, or tongue thrusts them out. But he loves these and they are easy to keep in his mouth.  I love that they come in a little storage box. We keep one box in the pocket of our baby carrier (ergo) and one in the diaper bag."
My 3 month old really loves her Wabbanub. It's very easy for her to grab. She mostly plays with the doll and is less interested in the pacifier which is a good thing because I think it will make weening a lot easier.
"As far as I have been able to tell, these are hands-down the healthiest pacifiers available on the market.  I want to feel very comfortable about anything I allow my children to put in their mouth (especially for a prolonged period of time), and to me these pass the test.  This is the only brand pacifier we buy."
My Grandson was attached to his first Brown Puppy so much I figured he would need a back-up in case puppy got lost. He loves the new one too!
I bought this for my nephew and momma was so excited.  It's Definitely worth the money.  Very cute and cuddly!
"Our LO loves these pacifiers.  The nipple is bigger than some pacifiers, and he seems to prefer them for that reason.  I also love the sanitizing case they come in.  You simply put a little bit of water in the case, put it in the microwave for a few minutes, and they come out sparkling clean and germ-free."
"My son is a breastfed baby who is also bottle fed at his sitter. He has never loved a pacifier, but when he is in the mood, this is his favorite one. He also likes to chew on all sides of it when he is teething. Highly recommend!"
"So, my grandson was complaining how nobody took him seriously, blah blah blah. I'm all like, &#34;Kid, yer 4 months old! Chill!&#34; And he's like, &#34;If I only had facial hair, people would listen to me!&#34;<br />So I got him this here thing.<br />Well, he was right. The Henryville Library now has a Jaxson Section. He spoke last night at the annual meeting of the Henryville Historical Society, and is considering running for mayor in 2016.<br />I highly recommend a mustache pacifier for every young boy."
"My grand-daughter does not  like any pacifier except the shape of this one.  I think it is more like the shape of a normal breast.<br />Soooooo, she has several.  These can be boiled and kept clean and there is always one handy."
This particular wubbanub is very soft and has remained that way after multiple cycles through the washing machine. It has not pilled like other animals we have. It stays put on my child and can easily be strapped into bouncy seat or stroller.
"Our daughter came out sucking when she was born, so much so that the dr told me if we didn't give her a pacifier she would suck until I was literally raw. As a mom who wanted to continue to breast feed with the least amount of pain, I took the drs advice but she had a hard time getting the paci back in her mouth by herself. We bought her this & now she can easily grab her kitty & use that to guide her paci to her mouth, works great!"
"I got this as a gift for the baby shower and the mother to be loved it. Its cute, super soft and very practican, I can imagine!"
Since both liked this pacifier has also bought more than three months. Recommend. The shape and material are excellent. Congratulations to Avent!
Received promptly and box works nicely to hold baby's paci and keep it safe from getting dirty and from my pets.
My baby nephew loves the pacifier. It looks like he's kissing a dinosaur. Its his favorite pacifier and one of his favorite toys. Its basically a two for one deal.
"After my first kiddo refused to take a paci, I was prepared for #2. I bought a stockpile of these (the same ones they use as the hospital) and we haven't had any issues with them besides them disappearing! They are different than the ones you can get in the big store, they have a more matte finish where the others are shiny, my little one definitely prefers these."
"I was looking for a pacifier case, and this was perfect! Not only is the price great, but it also serves its purpose. It keeps pacifiers clean, and this case is a nice compact size to fit in my bag. It's made of nice quality and sturdy plastic, and I like how securely it snaps close. The loop doesn't seem as sturdy, but I don't use the loop, so it doesn't matter to me. It fits one pacifier no problem. but you can squeeze two in there, depending on the brand."
I got the 6-18 months for my 3 month old and he didn't quite like it but he really likes this one. He was used to the soothie before and took this one easily. Its great that it comes with a cap to keep it clean and taking it along when you go out.
My daughter has loved her lamb WubbaNub. It was easy for her to grab when she was younger and it didn't bounce all around when it fell on the floor. She is 20 months now and just uses it at night to help her get to sleep. Per the warnings on it you need to be careful once they have teeth as if they use it as a teether (as my daughter began to do) the end will break off and can be a choking hazard.
"My son must have about 20 of these. He's 14 moths old now and he's never liked the &#34;regular&#34; pacifiers, just the Soothies ones. He used to like the Soothies on their own and played with these, overtime though he stopped using them and switched exclusively to Wubbanubs. He talks to them, snuggles them, sneaks up on and scares them, lol. I frequently search for new designs and was so happy to find this one. He's in the wash now and I can't wait to surprise my son with him. He has buckets of toys, but these are by far the only thing he really likes. Yes he uses it as a pacifier but they're also his &#34;friends&#34;. I can see them sticking around long after the pluggie part has been surgically removed."
"My daughter loves these pacifier/toys.  We have one for her crib, one for our bedroom, one for downstairs, one for the car, and one for the diaper bag.  She can hold the toy and replace the pacifier part in her mouth, and these are large enough for us to easily keep track of.  To wash them, I simply throw them in the washer, and let them air dry, then I wipe the pacifier part with one of the pacifier wipes.  I highly recommend these!"
It helps especially when I drive and baby is in the back. Using the pacifier calm he down during long drive. Baby can latch on properly without falling off
"When your baby cries in the night and you're trying to quiet her so she doesn't wake your other baby, what do you do when you can't find a g-d binky?? Do yourself a favor and get at least 2 glow binkies. Save yourself the frustration of looking for a normal pacifier in the dark or with a nightlight. These don't glow crazy bright, just bright enough that you can see them if your eyes are already adjusted to the dark. Love them!"
Great price! We bought this because we kept loosing binkys. We have endless supply now :) it's been 3 months and we still have one unopened pack! Just be careful if your child has teeth. My son managed to bite a hole in one but no rubber was missing. I think it's normal wear and tear.
These are my son's favorite pacifiers.  He loves how they feel in his mouth and the silicone is very soft.  I do with that they weren't quite so clear - sometimes it's hard to find where he throws them.
My son received a WubbaNub like this as a gift when he was born. It quickly became the favorite pacifier (aka &#34;B Duck&#34; - what he calls all pacifiers now). I bought a second one as a back up just in case something happened to the original. So far he has not noticed the difference and seems to love this one just as much as the original.
"8 of us played this at a shower and it was a big hit.  super cute.  no, it's not the highest quality baby pic...etc..and you do have to cut the binkies out with scissors, but i figure who cares....and if you have a big kid or a teenager at home, have them cut it out for you.  it's no big deal.  it's such a low price, it's worth it.  it's just a game that takes a few minutes anyway.  it doesn't have to be perfectly amazing.  it's just simply fun..and cute."
"I thoroughly researched pacis before I chose ones that I was ok with my son using, and among the ones we tried, this was the only one he ever liked.  It's kind of frustrating that Prime shipping isn't available because when I need them in a pinch (this is the only place I have EVER seen them), I just have to wait it out.  However, I chose it because of the nipple shape (which is close to an actual nipple but for some reason hard to find) and the materials (silicone). Also, oddly enough, we get actual compliments on this pacifier all the time (bizarre I know).  People will say, &#34;I really like that pacifier!&#34; or &#34;What a cute pacifier!&#34;.  It never occurred to me to notice a child's pacifer! Haha"
"It's a good way to keep pacifier In baby mouth . And it's so cute and soft , baby likes"
"This is the only pacifier we need. Our baby loves it. She spent the first few weeks of her life in the children's hospital, and all the nurses loved this pacifier. It is soft yet durable, and can double as a toy."
Our baby girl went straight from the Hawaii Medical Gum Drop pacifiers to these and had no issue. She does great with these and keeps them in her mouth much better than she was with those as she got older. I bought another 2 after trying them out with her.
"My baby girl will not use anything else, they are easy to clean and have held up very well so far. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that is having a hard time with their baby accepting other brand/shapes of pacifiers."
absolutely love this! great to change my baby on and give him sponge baths. material is really easy to clean up if he happens to have an accident on it. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a changing pad.  like it way better than a changing table.
my so. loved it  ww love the material and the dinos are clear plus very colorful best decision ever made
"we got this as a gift for our baby shower in october and used it in our bedroom before she was born. we left it on for days on end and the batteries haven't died yet (4 months later)! we have attached it to our lil one's carseat and it soothes her whenever we are out and about. it's small, discreet and powerful. i always give this as a gift to my new mommy friends now!"
i've only owned this set for a month but my almost 2 year old loves it! its a very silky feeling material - i wish it was more like cotton but i couldn't find a full set for cheaper. so this will work. :) kids happy so mamas happy.
"i am very happy with this purchase and so is my little one:)<br />it may not have some features i am not even aware of, but it's doing the job, kid is comfortable, and wasn't expensive..."
"my grandson managed to break off one of our knobs to our gas stove, so after replacing it, i decided to invest in these.  best thing i ever did - he twirls them around, but he cannot open them (he's two).  no more replacing knobs!"
"this has been a life saver, we live in florida so you know its sunny, our little angel hates the sun in her face, this shade is perfect, it installs in seconds and keeps out the sun....."
these contents of these ice packs are non-toxic and do a good job of keeping breastmilk cold. they are pretty good value for the price and have survived daily use for 2 months without issue. i think they are quite durable and will not hesitate to buy again.<br /><br />highly recommend!
i bought two of these. i've configured it so many different ways to keep my child safe. i make an octagon like the picture. i've used two in parallel from wall to wall in my living room. i used half to cover the kitchen area. easy to build. no tools necessary. endless configurations. i've had it for 4 years. still looks new.
easy to put on crib and saved our crib from multiple teething marks.  washable and easy to take on and off when needed.
best buy for baby food storage! i recommend this to all moms that are using the baby bullet to store food.
i'm a first time mom and my daughter recently got sick for the first time. she is only two months old and trying to use a bulb syringe was horrible for both of us. the snotsucker is wonderful. she cried the first time we used it but since then she's gotten used to it. no more cries and she even smiles once we get done. it really helps her feel better.
"for a toddler who is crazy for angry birds, this is a great present! how about more stuff--play figures, playsets, puzzles, kitchen, etc."
"i'm not sure which one of us likes the swing more, me or my son. he will swing / play in this swing for hours. he is fascinated by the stars that hang overhead, and the gentle rocking motion is great when he is fussy. it is battery operated, but seems to be gentle on use. we are still on the same batteries after 2 months of regular use. the swing is easy to fold and stores easily. not as portable as the small swings, but is constructed much better than those and is still easy to take down and throw in the car."
"this is not an eye sore of a toy compared to the other chairs and bouncers in my opinion.  it's not too loud, and it will fit my big baby (76 percentile) unlike the other chairs which is looks to be too long for.  i also like that it was very easy to put together, and appears easy to take apart.  i saved the box it came in to that once the baby is not using it anymore i can easily store it for my next babe.  i went with the grey to save a bit a money as this is a pricey chair but i think it's made much better than the others out there."
"this is a great monitor. at it's most sensitive setting we can hear the little one breathing at night...we usually run it around the medium setting.<br />the noise lights help when you have the tv up loud or are watching a movie.<br />the temperature display and alarms are useful if you have temperature swings in the nursery.<br />the remote unit is light and the batteries last a good while.<br /><br />the night light is no use at all, but i'm not going to take a star off just for that.<br />also, we don't use the lullabies - we have sonos for that."
i bought this for my 4 year daughter (before her birthday) and we have been pleased with how easy it is to set up and store. i have a 4-door pick up truck and this is very easy to install. it's amazing how the seat remains secure without the seat belt on when my daughter is not sitting in it. my wife and i have been very pleased.
"this chair has been great for my 5 month old son. he outgrew his bouncer so i opted for this one since they can use it through toddlerhood. it is great for strapping him in to play and he will nap in it in the reclined position. just note that it does not rock on it's own, only vibrates...still great for the price. it also folds down nicely and is very light for travel."
i got this for the pack and play that i ordered and really liked that the sheet was padded!  my daughter in law said she had never seen one!
"i bought this for my grandson and he loves it! it's colorful, bright and loaded with fun activities to keep interested and busy! it is also very lightweight yet durable and i am excited that even when he eventually outgrows the stationary bouncing stage i can covert it into a play station he can continue to enjoy!"
these do not spill! they lock! they work like a charm for our one year old daughter. she loves drinking out of them. and i love not having to clean up any spills. no more milky smell on her toys. i do not dislike anything about these. plus they are very easy to clean.
item was received as a gift for our newborn grand babies.  we are excited to be able to hold both babies with confidence that they are happy and safe.
"easy for him to grasp & hold, and i'm not picking it up off the floor all the time.  the rubber is soft and squeezy and he loves the shape.  not stinky like others"
i absolutely love penguins so when i saw this i had to get it for my nephew for christmas. needless to say he loves it as much as i love penguins. much larger than expected and very durable!
"my grandson wouldn't put it down (unless he dropped it by accident). his particular goal was chewing on it, but the tunes and lights fascinated him as well."
the best gift i have ever purchased for a new baby. they are excellent quality and oh so so soft
"i purchased this as a gift for my 2 year old.  she enjoys caring this backpack around with her little items in it.  the bag was delivered as expected, it was packaged well, and had no defects. i am very happy with this purchase!!"
i sleep better knowing my baby is sleeping safely in her halo sleep sack! we have been using these for about 3 months and i would highly recommend them.
huge towel! perfect! this is exactly what i was needing for my son. thanks. it's pretty soft and cozy.. good
"it seems like every baby has a sophie.  and why shouldn't they?  it's made in france with natural rubber and food grade paint.  no worries as you watch your precious little one suck, bite and tear at sophie's little hooves, ears and sometimes her entire head.  and it seems kids of all ages love hearing the sound of her squeaker.  my big kids can't stop squeezing her in rapid secession to get another squeak!"
i received my wall decor in good time..it was wrapped good..decal was placed on wall n looks great..i would recommend you ordering from them all went smooth.
i ordered the medium bag in outer space print.  it's the perfect size to throw in the diaper bag for an afternoon outing.  i can fit 6-ish diapers if i really stuff em in there when they are dirty.  the dimensions measure 15\\ tall and 12\\ wide. we have 3 planet wise wet bags and two pail liners and they all seem well made and hold up in the washer and dryer.  i just throw them in with my cloth diapers (both for wash and dry) and they do great.  they contain the stink well while out and about- my only problem is remembering to take the wet bag out of the diaper bag when i get home (finding the dirties days later in the diaper bag is a special treat lol!)
my daughter was fascinated with the contents of the cabinets doors of my desk.  these are perfect at keeping her out and didn't require me drilling into the wood.  the adhesive is very strong and i haven't had any problem with these tearing out.  i imagine these would work great for other things too!
ordered this for my daughter's nursery. item arrived in no time and is super plush. easily fits the summer infant changing pad.
i gave this to my tow grandsons (one is 2 and the other just turned 1) for christmas and they loved. an old fashon simple toy that needs no batteries.
"i have video on youtube of her playing with this toy, she's six months old, and she loves it. she got the biggest smile when i gave it to her."
"this car seat is absolutely perfect for my 10 month old daughter!! we had to upgrade from the chicco keyfit 30 due to a car accident.  in order to leave the hospital, my husband and i had to go get a new car seat.  we went to the nearest babies 'r' us while my daughter was still admitted, and purchased a safety first similar model, and loved the look of it.  however, when my daughter would fall asleep in it, her head would fall forward every time, looking so uncomfortable, and that couldn't have been good for her developing neck!! so, i returned it and did my research on amazon and decided to spend the money on this seat.  i am so happy with the purchase! the print is beautiful, even more vibrant in person and is a soft, velour type material.  it is relatively easy to install, depending on whether you use the anchors and their position in your car.  its not too heavy, and my daughter is so snuggled and comfortable in it, she falls asleep almost immediately making for a much happier car ride for my family!! i would definitely recommend this, and will purchase it for my future children."
i love it! its just gorgeous! i cant wait to put it in my daughters nursery crib! its going to look spectacular!
"A perfect size for little hands to hold and carry around. My son loves to hold and throw them, and since they are light, he can't do any damage."
They are adorable. My daughter loves them. I like the quality of the Wubbanubs. They are great for little hands to hold into their pacifier in the car.
This is a hilarious gift for any baby.  I got this for my friend and he always uses it when he has company.  It' always gets a laugh out of guests.  Babies plus mustaches equals funny.
I ordered these as a baby shower gift and the mama is happy with them so far and glad that they are BPA free.
These are by far my favorite binkies. My little guy is nursing and used these right from the start with no problems or confusion. Seriously a life saver!
Protector is easy to apply and is holding up really well. Excellent product. I'll buy my next one from here.
She loves it. Little girls like to be able to play and nurse on the nuk. She won't go without ur.
My daughter and granddaughter love this pacifier.  It is easily washed in the washing machine.  Does not get lost easily.
"Baby is 10 weeks old and prefers this pacifier over 3 other brands we've bought.  And it comes in a 6 pack, which you will lose 2 right away!"
"My wife hates the thought of me ever using this but I can't wait.  The quality seems good and it is dentist approved supposedly (there is some type of standard on that) so my wife can't stop this on that basis, the only thing she threatened was to throw it out but I said I'd just buy another so I think I good to go.  I'll update this if my newborn hates it when she gets to actually use it."
Love this product. I purchased this product for my daughter's new baby. It helps to protect the nuke from germs. I love the colors and satisfaction we get in knowing that air born germs are not spreaded on our baby's pacifier. Light weight and different. Highly recommend this item to new moms and seller.
This was a great baby shower present.  I previously purchased the monkey wubbanub and my son could not fall asleep without it!  I sort of wish the pacifier part was removable for easy cleaning but otherwise no complaints!
"My baby girl LOVES all her Wubanubs. After I tried 6 different types of pacifiers, the hospital one was her favorite one. This is a genius idea!"
my granddaughter wanted a pink hamper with peace signs on it.  she had not seen one but that' s what she wanted.  so i googled it  and i found it and ordered it and she loved it.  just what she wanted she said.  so a very happy little girl i had.
i thought it was great they did just what they said  . it arrived just when they said it would and my grandson loves it! so does his mommy. thank you. will difinately order again.
my granddaughter's favorite game is peek a boo so when a friend of mine told me she saw this bear i had to get it! she loves it! it also will be a great keepsake as she grows! she is 13 months!
"when i took the childb out of his jumperoo, heb screamed sound loud it was just like dragging an alcoholic  outbid a bar!!!"
my daughter has worn this since she has been 3 months old. we rarely take it off. it seems to work. she barely has drooled and very few occasions where she has been in pain. i think it helps with teething. i get lots of compliments on it. it's cute stylish and sheek. i think i'm going to get a rose quartz necklace next. she is 15 months old and still wears it. she has never tugged or pulled at it. i love it!!
a gift i will buy again as a baby gift. my nine month old loves it and is well made
used the animal alphabets along with the  jungle animal decals to decorate my granddaughter's room  they were easy to apply.  the room looks adorable and she loves them.  highly recommend.
it's awesome!! never seen anything like it and my daughter loves it!! great item i recommend it. it's worth every penny
i keep ordering these covers.  they are perfect for my daughter and keep her hands and panties from toughing gross public toilets.  these covers fix on just about every toilet style out there and are perfect for carrying in my purse.
these along with the potty they are meant for work great.  they hold a large amount of liquid without spilling or smelling.  i leave these in my car with the potty for times when you can't just pull up to a bathroom right now.
no complaints with this gate it works great!  i can't imagine that the baby will figure out how to open it.
"it was sent as a gift for my new grand daughter.  she is too small yet but will enjoy it, i am sure, as one of her first toys!  the baby's mother said this toy is rated high and is very glad her infant daughter received it as a gift."
this horse was bigger than expected.<br />really loved it.<br />the horse neighs and has a really nice sound when you shake it.<br />totally recommend it!!!
perfect for my shabby chic inspired bathroom. would be cute in a nursery. i would recommend that the seller put some sort of hard flat layer in between the liner and wicker so that the buyer can stand items inside the basket easily. i'm using mine for bathroom organizers but my products won't stand up because of the uneven surface. i will be cutting up pieces of cardboard to lay down in between. other than this i love these baskets.
"we loved this diaper on our slender, 8 1/2 pound heavy wetter. the inside looks kind of wrinkly, which seems like it might be uncomfortable, but she doesn't seem to mind. the fit is excellent at both the waist and the legs, which has been hard for us to find, and it did not leak at all. plus the monkeys are adorable! we've had bad fits with the grovia newborn aio and the fuzzibunz extra small pocket diaper - both of those are loose at the waist on her and have leaked up the back on multiple occasions. the only other diapers that have consistently worked well for us are the rumparooz 'lil joeys and prefolds with a thirsties cover. full disclosure - so far we have only used it once. i will update this rating if we have any trouble with it in the future."
"these are just the best bibs. they're soft silicone, can be easily rinsed off after a meal and be washed in the dishwasher (top rack) anytime. there're easy to put on and have a hole to hang up to dry."
"when i received this, i was delightfully surprised in the classical music.  i happen to love it.<br />not only is this toy easy to hold, and really adorable, i think the classical music makes it a<br />little different from the rest, and maybe even more comforting while taking my great grandson<br />is going to sleep.  couldn't be better"
i bought this for my graco pack n play.  it fits well over the mattress that came with the pack n play and is very soft.
i have purchased a total of 4 of these sheets for my daughter's pack n play. the sheet pulls out flat so that you do not have to be concerned with the baby smothering if they sleep on there stomach. it fits perfectly over the pack n play mattress. my baby sleeps comfortably each night. only complaint is there are not very many color or pattern optio
"bought the set for my grandson, loved it, he enjoys eating with his new tools, which will last him until he's ready for the next si"
"my daughter loves these shapes and letters. good bath fun. quality and durable for biters and chewers. they rinse well and &#34;stick&#34; to walls and your child because of the water suction, which makes and additional activity for your child to enjoy putting them all over the tub. for myself, it was a way to get my daughter to like bath time again. good toy!"
"i use this gate to keep my two cats separated. one of them likes to &#34;attack&#34; that other sometimes, and this helps to keep them apart. i wanted something tall, so that they could not jump over it. this is the perfect height. one of my cats is only 6 pounds, and she can walk right through one set of the bars, but the other one, who is about 12 pounds, cannot fit through at all. i also like this gate because i rent an apartment, and i didn't have to put any holes in my landlord's walls to set this up."
"i love the graco my ride!  super easy to install and very comfortable.  the head support kept my son super snug which was great for my 3 month old to feel secure.  after he got a bit bigger and wanted to look around the support can come out with ease.  the seat has enough padding for him to be very comfortable as well.  installing was super easy with the visual indicator on the side.  the seat is very big so if you have a very small car it may not fit well, however i didn't experience any problems with this in my vehicle.  some reviewers said they found it difficult to adjust the straps while in the rear facing position, i don't seem to have that problem.  once your familiar with how the mechanism works you shouldn't have to see it to do it."
keeps my baby occupied more than any of his other toys while i clean my house! i love this gym set
got this for my grandson for christmas & while inexpensive it proved to be his favorite gift.  in fact; he & his little brother fought over it on several occasions.  well worth the price & i think i shall have to order another one to prevent ww iii!
what can you say it works like it's suppose to. i'm suppose to take up some more space with words so blah blah blah we love it we really do.
"our kids share a room and have a ton of animals, they love to see all their stuffy's &#34;faces&#34; and how easy it is to rotate out weekly favorites to decorate their beds.  the hammock seems very sturdy with the metal hooks and truly holds a bunch of animals as described!"
amazing! it's a modern technical when i first time knew it. it comes with lovely pictures and gentle music. this is the best recommend if you want to buy for a gift. babies gonna love it!
this car seat is really great. very easy to hook up and my grand daughter looks very comfortable sitting in it.
"i remember looking at this product when i was filling out my baby registry and puking in my mouth a bit at the thought of a &#34;snot sucker.&#34;  fast forward a few months. life has changed forever, and i have been eating my words every day.  i love this thing.  it works about 10x better than the hospital bulb we had been using. :our baby is not a fan of either, but he sounds much less congested and happier after this option. super easy to piece apart and clean, and there have been no disgusting breaches of the filter.  i wouldn't recommend trying this in public, though. ;)"
5 stars because it is hard to mess up plastic play balls. quality plastic and perfect size for play pools or bin. kids love playing in them.
easy to put together nice and comfortable well worth the price it took 10 minutes to pull it from the box until i was sitting in it
"i love this bag! i travel extensively and was looking for a bag that was attractive, sturdy and had multiple accessible pockets. this bag is perfect! i've used it extensively for multiple trips. i love the bright colored, roomy interior, ample pockets, deep zippered front pockets, and open front pockets.  the aqua interior makes it easy to locate items and the deep pockets help keeps items separate and reachable. this bag easily holds multiple items, makes organizing a breeze and most importantly, it is very comfortable to carry. the straps are well-made and the width is perfect so it doesn't cut in to my shoulders.  i would buy this again in a heartbeat."
"this is an amazing little toy for my grandson, it really catches his attention , and makes him smile alot"
was a gift for a chef's newborn and she loved it!<br />very cute and well-made! could also work as a halloween costume!
"this is one of those products that change the way you live. we got this when our baby was 3.5 months old and she took to it immediately. she is now almost 7 months old. it is comfortable for both baby and her caregiver, whomever it may be at the time. my mil, husband, babysitter, and i are all different heights (153 cm to 172 cm) and different sizes (50 kg to 83 kg) and this carrier can adjust to fit us all comfortably. there are many things i love about this carrier.<br /><br />pros:<br />- the biggest pro for us is the mesh cooling vent. the daily temperature here averages 28c to 35c with tropical humidity. while you're never going to be completely cool while carrying baby, the mesh makes it much more comfortable to do so.<br />- did i mention how comfortable it is to use? the wide waist belt provides loads of support and the shoulder straps are thick & padded. i like that you can wear the waist strap higher (on the waist) or lower (resting on the hips) to adjust for baby's height. i love having my baby within kissing distance!<br />- comfortable for baby! she's snug as a bug in a rug and regularly falls asleep while still in the carrier. the inward-facing design doesn't seem to bother her as she can still see out the sides (outward-facing carriers are not good for baby's development). in fact, she seems to prefer being high up in the carrier as she has a better view rather than being in her stroller.<br />- the sleeping hood is generously cut and is large enough to accommodate even a tall toddler. the way the hood is designed means that there are no strings or straps that can cut into baby's face. the straps to fasten the hood are attached to it and it all rolls neatly into provided front pocket. there are no dangling strings or buckles to get in the way. we've used the hood to help her sleep, keep the sun off her face and to keep the rain off her head.<br />- the front pocket is not very large, especially with the hood already tucked into it. however there is enough space to tuck some keys, cash and a phone if all you're doing is going for a walk or a quick run to the store.<br />- easier and more convenient than a stroller. we no longer take our graco stroller on outings now. having to take a stroller was so cumbersome and unwieldy, especially in crowds. the stroller also took up all the space in the trunk. now we just put baby in her carrier, grab the ju ju be bff and we're ready to go.<br /><br />cons:<br />- the care instructions state that it is best to avoid washing the carrier and to spot clean only. this has something to do with the organic dye used on the fabric and is supposed to help keep the carrier looking new. this is not a huge issue for me but i can imagine it being a big deal for some others. i highly recommend buying the drool pads and using them with the carrier from the very beginning to avoid getting any stains on it.<br />- no way to attach anything to the carrier. i would have liked to have a d-ring or two on the carrier so that a toy / pacifier can be attached to it and within reach the moment it is needed. imo this is something small that would be a great improvement to the utility of the carrier.<br /><br />overall, a great product and well worth the money spent!"
this was delivered faster than i expected. the cover is exactly what you see and i love it. it has all the regular things a baby book should. even space to write up till month 12
"We used Nuk orthodontic solid piece silicone pacifiers until he outgrew them around 5-6 months. I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!"
"The only pacifier my son will take! It's easy to clean/keep clean and I have peace of mind knowing that it's made out of a really durable, natural material. The round nipple makes it so that the pacifier never slips out of his mouth, even when he's passed out. We love these pacifiers and get compliments on their appearance all the time! Perfect &#34;crunchy mom&#34; pacifier and my kiddo looks pretty darn cute with it. :)"
i have choose this rating because i luv quality the timing it was deliver n the stuff butterfly is adorable n my grandaughter luvs it can sleep without it
A lot of parents purchased the item.<br />The baby loves it.<br />easy to find<br />The baby easily can take it out and put it back in her mouth
Babies seem to love WubbaNubs. As a grandmother with three granddaughters these are adorable and durable. The pacifier can be cut off if the child is older and wants it only as a lovie.
I love this product for newborns.  If your baby takes a pacifier they can also hold onto something so incase it slips out of there mouths they do not fall on the floor that quickly.  They are easy to clean as well.  They are also very cute!
Purchased this for my sister's shower and everyone loved this game. We had a lot of fun. Glad I decided to purchase it.
I love these but hard to find to order sometimes so when I do find them I usually order a few.  These were used in the hospital for my newborn so I figured I would purchase and extra set.  They are such a nice product for babies.  They seem to work out better then other pacifiers.
"Let me start out by saying I hate the idea of a pacifier, probably due to fear of wheening them off of it when the time was right.  But with this Wubbanub it made it an easy transition.  My daughter absolutely is obsessed with her WubbaNub which we've named Gary.  With the small animal attached to the pacifier it made it easy for her to search for it in the middle of the night without the assitance of my husband or I.  Then around the age of 2, the pacifier actually broke off of the stuffed animal due to wear & tear (my kid would hold onto the pacifier with her teeth and pull it out of her mouth constantly).  I honestly freaked out a little thinking it was going to be a heck of a night without the pacifier but my daughter was so in love with Gary that the comfort of having the animal itself still intact made it a breeze."
I bought several styles of these funny pacifier for 2 grandsons. They are real conversation starters & bring smiles to all who see them.
"I paid almost 7 dollars for two of them locally, and was so happy that I found this deal. I love these pacifiers and they're the only ones my daughter will use. It's unfortunate that my dog also likes them, if she can get ahold of them, so I need a lot on hand. It's also nice to have in case you lose them or they're being sterilized, etc.  Good quality. Very happy with the purchase."
The only pacifier my baby will take.  Worth the investment. My baby is breastfed and hates bottles but he loves this paci
My now 12 month old likes these and I feel good about the natural rubber.  The natural rubber lasts approx. 6-9 months of baby sucking before getting sticky.  Not much difference between their &#34;6-12 month&#34; and the &#34;12 months and up&#34; products.
"My baby's ONLY pacifiers...  They actually STAY IN!!  Even when they are little.  And as they grow older, there is much more for them to grab onto.  Couldn't live without.  And I am sure that this will be my little one's lovie...  At almost 5 months she loves to hold onto it for comfort whether or not it is in her mouth.  Had to buy a second recently as a back up because don't ever want to be without..."
"These are great pacifiers. My son loves them and being able to see them in the dark is amazingly helpful!! I have had experiences in the past on Amazon, getting pink or purple when I ordered blue, but these were blue."
Title states it all.. the baby can hold it and doesn't have the slightest issue.  I would buy more if I had to.
"I've listed WubbaNub pacifiers as must haves for many of my friends who are having babies. Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter. That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple.

We bought this for a friend's baby's baptism as a gift. She loved it. I would recommend this. We love the wubbanub.
"These are very funny and we are glad we got them, grandma doesn't appreciate them as much as we do..lol :)"
Didn't want to use pacifier clips with cords so decided to give this little guy a whirl.  LO loves his paci!  He can grip it and makes it much easier for him to find his mouth.  Great quality silicone paci and the giraffe is soft and attached solidly.  Would definitely recommend this product!
these are the best pacifiers. you dont lose them as often. they last a long time and it something for the kid to cuddle with.
"My wife & I were given a Clifford version of this as a gift. As we started to lose track of clifford, from the car, crib, grandparents house etc., I knew that I had to grab a new one.<br /><br />The WubbaNub is great. Soft animal for my baby to rub her fingers on, while soothing binky to help her sleep or relax.<br /><br />Some complain that the binky doesnt detach, and it's not safe to wash - however hand washing the binky and animal is acceptable. If  you want a detached binky do not buy this.<br /><br />If you know what you want, and what your kid likes, this is perfect. I will be getting more of these for my baby & any future kids I have/ my family or friends have. No doubts, or problems at all."
There's not much more to say.  Give your baby or your friend's or your friend's friend's baby a cool 'stache.<br /><br />(Annoying minimum word review.)
"Got this for my nephew for his first birthday.  All the adults in the room couldn't stop laughing when he used this, and he seemed to like it as well!"
THESE TEETH LOOK SO COOL ON MY NEW NEICE. GREAT FOR PICTURES OR EVEN WITH A HALLOWEEN COSTUME. BUGS BUNNY ANYONE??!!
Got this for my friend who was expecting and she absolutely loved it. It looks about the right size and exactly as pictured.
Kind of a gag gift but I bought this for my younger sister after she announced her pregnancy and she loved it. Lots of laughs all around.
I love it. cant say yet if hes going to like it since I haven't had my son but its super cute.
"This is a darling little lamb and a great concept.  It's a little smaller than I had envisioned but truly the perfect size for a little one to hold on to.  It shipped very quickly too.  So if my niece likes it, you can bet I'll be buying more!"
This is the best thermometer ever.  You can take a child's temp without disturbing their sleep at all.<br />It does everything it says it will.<br />LOVE IT!
"Perfect for my little one, just like the ones she got at the hospital.  Only downside is not having a ring to hang on to, but not much of an issue."
"Love this pacifier!  Just like the ones given to us in the hospital and the baby loves to hold onto the caterpillar.  We introduced it around 3 weeks old, but up until about 6 weeks old, she could not hold onto it.  Now, at 7 weeks, she does not let go of this Cutsie Caterpillar."
My baby loves this. It helps her sleep. I love how the lamb is attached to it. It helps her keep the pacifier in her mouth
My 2 month old son Loves it! It just need a cap to cover it when he is not using it.
"High ratio of performance to price, The quality is very good,It is just what I need,I like it very much."
I got these for my son from the hospital and they were so awesome that I bought them for my daughter years later! Easy to clean!
"Cute, Fun, Well Designed, Highly Recommended, especially for fun photos, Fast Ship Love this Seller-<br />Great Price and makes a great present for anyone who has a baby."
"While I could never get my son to take a pacifier, this one was the only one he would take (or just chew on). It travels well and despite being thrown all over the place for the last six months, it looks brand new still.<br /><br />I love how my son was able to hold onto the giraffe and chewed on the pacifier. It almost served as a lovey for a long time."
"The greatest invention of all man-kind, better than sliced bread!  The wubbanub has helped our daughter soothe herself back to sleep and even learn to hold and grab when she was younger.  At night if she wakes up and needs a pacifier she will magically find her wubbanub, turn it around and put it in her mouth.  She started using the wubbanub at 2-3 months and now is 8 months.  I've read many blogs that say you can continue to use after 6 months, but to gauge if nipple is too small for baby.  I also read that the company plans on making another size smoothie for 6+ months! until then we are sticking with these.  Great gifts too!  I have bought 2 and will purchase more!"
"Purchased this for the humor of it, money well spent. Everyone finds it amusing. It's a good pacifier but not great, although I can't say why. I just know that it's not our go to pacifier for our son. Purchased it around Halloween as part of an outfit for our son."
My niece is teething and she loves this pacifier.  She is a little doll and the Hello Kitty design suits her very well.
"Baby boy loves it. When he starts to cry, I put it in his mouth and that will calm him down. The little tiger and frog are just too cute!"
Wubbanubs are my &#34;go-to baby gift&#34;!  Parents love them almost as much as the babies do!  They are durable and super handy!
"This was a fun, out-of-the-norm, but useful item.  My friend loves it for her little boy, and said it was well-constructed."
I Love the bright colors and my Son is the only one who's got it!  I love having something original!
i love these pacifiers. their just like the ones you recieve in the hospital but these ones have a nose whole that i like. the kids like these and heir easy to attach to a holder because the ends in the front have a whole so you can loop it thru.
"I bought the Ella Bella Elephant and its just the cutest thing, everyone always comments on how cute it is, it also helps my baby girl keep it in her mouth without losing it."
"I like how easy this is to catch when my little one spits it out lol! I also like that if he is in the carseat it is easy for him to find and put back in his mouth, I am going to buy a spare one just so we don't have a meltdown! I would recommend this for any parent :-)"
"For the hipster in every parent.  We purchased this as a baby shower gift from a list.  Parents love it and it looks exactly like the picture.  Its a sucker, what else do you need to know?"
These pacifers are cute.  They are easier to keep up with.<br />The baby can hold onto the pacifer as well.
These are great. My baby loves these for some reason. They are the only brand he'll take. Cute monster design too.
We lose pacis all over the house so it's nice to have something a little bigger.  It's also easy for a small child to hold onto when sleeping.  Love this!
very good and cute! my baby loves it! and i love it too but would have been better if there's cover to come with.
we use this gate for the bottom of the stairs it works great. just be mindful that it has a lip at the bottom of the gate so would not be ideal for the top of the stairs because it's very easy to trip over. great gate.
this is a great shirt for any fan - excellent color and the material is good - definitely recommend it!
"gave as a baby shower gift.  they loved it!  i loved it - it's beautiful.  i stuffed it with a clothesline gift of baby clothes, books, bibs.  a big hit!"
this is the best teether ! gave it to my 6 month old grandbaby and she didn't put it down! a little pricey but well worth it!
i got these because i was worried that letting my older infant use the 0-3 month size would be some sort of safety hazard. the only real difference is that the plastic on this size is thicker (and thus maybe sturdier). he seems to like them as much as he liked the softer 0-3 month size. but there is enough difference between the sizes that a baby who is more particular about the softness of his soothie might prefer one or the other.
i love it. so pretty my god daughter loved it as well.  good quality blanket. nice material and warm as well.
"we got mr. cow. or mr. moo. or mooie. he has been known by all three aliases. we bought these after my infant took so quickly to clutching her cousin's angel dear elephant (also totally precious) when she'd go down for a nap at her grandma's house and summer place. we soon learned that lovies, even at the young age of three months, were a bingo for getting our endless nurser off the boob in less time. we chose moo-cows because heck, it's vt. unlike giraffes, she's guaranteed to see a real one in her lifetime.<br /><br />it's soft, and lightweight, and easy to pack in a diaper bag, but also has some solidity in the head, and little nubby ears and corners of the blankie to suck on. she also likes to drape it over her face, as she gets older, when she's sleepy and seemingly wants to shut out the world. i love these things, and if you have a diaper bag that's constantly in use, or a caregiver that's not in your home, it's super helpful to have three - one that lives in the crib, one for her go-bag, and the constant 'in the wash' duplicate."
"i've been eye-balling the meitai carrier style for a while now. i've, thus far, been using ring slings and baby wraps which have been wonderfully versatile for my carrying needs. but i haven't quite managed successfully wrapping my baby in a back carry without help and on really hot days i dread having to be wrapped up in all that cloth. so this purchase has been great. i've only had it for two days but already i can see there is a lot more airflow so me and my baby don't overheat in the florida weather. also, i was able to quickly hoist up my baby into a back carry so i could get some house cleaning done. and my baby had fun in her new vantage point."
"They've been durable so far (including several times through the washer), and he'll suck on them happily for extended periods."
"My new born LOVES this, he likes hugging it while he uses it. Fits in his hands just fine, we have tons of monkey stuff for him :)"
"Great value! These are so hard to find in our local stores, my daughter is super finicky when it comes to binkys. This brand is the only one she takes, other than her thumb!"
I bought two of these as gifts for my friend that was having twins.  Her boys both use and love these things.
"I had this set on my baby registry at target but it sold out :( so I found the gift set on amazon & ordered it immediately, it's prettier in person exactly what I was looking for since I want my baby to have all MAM bottles & pacifiers. I love how everything is broken down into pieces, easier to clean. Can't wait until my baby's here to use them! ;)"
"Despite reading the other reviews, I was still surprised how well made this was! The beads are all wooden with quality decorations. It fits with all of the different types of pacifiers I have for my pipsqueak, including her Soothies which have really small holes, so that's a plus. I was tempted to drop it a star because I wish the attachment was spring-based instead of clip-based but I love this thing so much I'm going to let that slide. I get tons of compliments on it and have completely tossed aside the other pacifier attacher I have."
This is great for babys.It stays in there mouth because of the wieght and they are adorable.A must have to keep baby satified and quiet.
"My 3 month old son absolutely adores his wubbanub. The first color infants see is red, which is why I chose this one. :)"
"I bought the dog when my little girl was born. Yes pricey but if you think about it, you are getting two in one. A snuggle friend for infants small enough to not worry about it smothering your little one and a soothie. I got the lamb for my little prince. It arrived faster than it was suppose to and packed well. Of course i will be buying more. They are adorable and my two month old loves it"
"She loved this so much because she could easily hold, grab, and position it. We got a back up in case she lost the first one."
my grandson loves his ! got these for the baby shower and hes 4 mos now and uses it regularly its very cute
My new nephew received this for Christmas. He was born in November and my sister said he's sleeping through the night since she started using it with him!
"so cute, well built. my daughter loves it. Soft, bright colours, The pacifier is also very soft not what I expected and my duaghter has no confusion between pacifier and breast"
my daughter loves these. well built. never interfered with our breastfeeding. cant get these so cheap here in Australia so its also a bargain. always getting asked about them and they are so cute.
"This Rubber Pacifier works really good, and our baby loves it very much. I've tried no less than five pacifier, and this is the only we are still using."
Absolutely love these nubs! They have been a life saver! So much easier to find and keep track of than plain nubs
"This product arrived within the timeframe as promised.  It is super cute, and good quality. I  gave this as a gift."
"A great product. Cute and very functional. Little bear helps baby hold on to paci or it can lay next to baby in bed. They used these in the NICU when my preemie was born, and they're now a staple for all of my baby shower gifts!"
these were a gag gift for my brother. hes a big cowboys fan that is always whining about not getting something cowboys..some good laughs
Santa brought this for my 3 month baby and I'm so glad he did!  She loves her green binky and is just starting to grasp onto toys/snuggle with soft toys.  This combination of the two makes for a perfect thing for her.  I've seen some of the other Wubbanubs and some of them are just ugly.  This one is so cute though - the face on the little lamb is adorable and it's velour-soft.  Love it.
As soon as mu girlfriend gave this to her new baby ... she and her husband started laughing so hard & taking pictures. I was delighted. I got texts and FB msgs for days. It made my month.
"I turned them into ornaments for my expecting co-worker. She loved them. Cute, affordable. Would definitely buy again for another sports fan."
"Great pacifier. Stays clear of baby's nostrils for easy breathing and suction if needed. Cute patterns/styles, as well. Soft edges won't hurt baby's gums when teething."
Sooo cute! I bought it to go with the baby cowboy outfit & it's the perfect accessory! I love it!
Me and my kids are sports fans and my first grandson will be also. My kids always used the Nuk and it worked great.
My 12 week old loves it and the hospital provided one so this is our go to brand for now.
Helps reduce the countless times my daughter drops her pacifier and keeps her more content in her car seat. Easy to clean too!
"we are so relieved that our son liked this pacifier.  He is exclusively breastfed and he is now 5 months.  After trying 5 different pacifier a friend gave me a Mexican honey filled pacifier and my son loved it.  We were scared it would pop but also I enjoyed the extra sleep, and  personal time.  I needed to find a pacifier that didn't frighten me yet he loved.  this one looks and feels just like the Mexican one.  I purchased the rounded butterfly 12 months and older.  I'm going to order a size down and keep this size for the future or as a spare."
my god did my babies love these....so much so they never took to another pacifier as they got bigger.  they would cry for these.<br />a word of caution:  once kids get a little bigger they can stuff the entire thing in their mouth and choke.  i caught my little ones a couple times with it nearly entirely in their mouth.  beware.
"we have these is several colors, my baby will not accept any other brand we've tried. She rejected NUK, and I don't feel comfortable giving her a pacifier that covers half her face (like those large round soothers)"
My boy has outgrown these awhile ago. We loved them. They're easy to wash and make the kid feel comfortable. I think be bought 20 in all. He finally outgrew them thou and now we're buying them for friends having kids.
"My son loves pacifiers, especially since they used them to soothe him in the NICU. I wanted something bigger, that would allow for further orthodontic development. My son prefers the silicone ones, as he also uses them as a teether the hard orthodontic part is completely sealed in by the silicone, and it's just easier to keep clean. Yay!."
Arrived fast. And this product really calm my baby down. He doesn't use it often. I like it but every baby is different. I would recommend.
We have gotten plenty of laughs from this passy for our son. Worth the fun and reaction of others. He liked using it as well once he got old enough for how big it was.
"I bought this for my grand daughter, and many people would stop us to ask where we bought it. Love it and many others as well."
"My sister purchased one like this and gifted it to me at my baby shower. Anytime my son sported it, he got endless comments on how edgy & cute it was. It became my son's go-to pacifier. I decided to order another one myself due to his old one wearing out. Shipping on this item was fast. Looking forward to gift a couple of these at future baby showers."
"This was a big hit for the babies. There were lots of pictures taken with them, but the handle bars were the best!"
"We won't use another binky. This is the only one that my daughter, will take and she loves them. I love the design as well!"
This pattern was so much better than what I was finding at the store. Very cute. My daughter only likes this brand.
My nephew loved this thing.  He loved being able to hold onto the dog while sucking on the nipple part.  Helped him with his hands and learning how to hold things.
I currently had the WubbaNub Monkey and do not leave home without it. Do to problem with my sons lower jaw he was not able to breast feed. But he still likes to suck. This has been a life saver already and will continue to come in handy. before receiving these products I was totally anti pacifier. However this product also works as a security blanket as well.
"First of all, I love that I can see the corners of my little guys lips when he smiles with his paci in! So cute! They also made it really easy for him to grab on to when he was getting his finger dexterity figured out."
we use this mattress for when we travel. it fits in graco (one grandma's pnp) and a cosco (other grandmother's pnp). daughter sleeps well and the pnp sheet works for it too. great product!
it was perfect using it in my daughter's crib before her transition to a big girl bed.  she now loves it in her bed.
we pack our daughter's lunch at 7am and she says it is still hot at noon. we haven't had any issues with leaking.
"just got it from amazon today, and a tub of generic apple sauce from our friendly neighbor. i just used a spare kitchen squeeze bottle to fill 10 pouches in minutes. definitely worth buying them."
"not only were they super affordable, but they are super durable. i exclusively pumped for my now 2 year old daughter (and always had a 2 + month supply in the freezer) so i went through a ton of bags, every brand had some that leaked, some more than others. i ended up buying simpleese bags, but they were insanely expensive ( i spent the money because they didn't leak) my now 4 month old nurses like a champ, but i still produce more than she drinks, so i pump a couple times a day to keep the supply up and in case we need to give her a bottle. these are the best bags i have ever tired!!! i wish i had them 2 years ago."
Gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas along with a copy of a Noah's Ark book.  She is Just beginning to walk and almost one-year-old.  The Ark is solid with wood cut-outs in the shape of animals and Noah's family and the child must learn to place the proper shape into the right hole.  So cute toy to teach sorting and Noah's place in Biblical history.
"Sent them to a friend that's a huge Alabama friend as an early baby gift. She doesn't know the gender, yet, but says she loves them either way."
This bear is adorable!! I got this for my expecting niece and brought. A smile :) it may or may not work for her newborn.. But is neat and makes a great baby shower gift!! Love it and the idea behind it!! :)
I like that these are not green like all of the other soothies I see in the stores. Super cute.
I breast feed exclusively and my baby is able to easily switch between this pacifier and my nipple. My newborn is also able to hold this pacifier.
"My son loved these pacifiers.... although he didn't suck on them, just let them hang out of his mouth.  They have to be replaced often because of the natural rubber so they can get expensive."
We are huge Wubba fans at our house. My son used this every day for the first 6 months of his life. He loved hanging onto the giraffe and playing with it while sucking on the pacifier. These are great.
This is a really cute idea for a pacifier--have seen other animals but only saw the dragon online--was thrilled with it
Same as the Pacifier that you get at the hospital in the nursery just  in a pretty color so the baby doesn't know the difference and adjust well.
Perfect for my newborn to keep in her mouth.  Now they she's not exactly a newborn it's easy to keep track of and find when she tosses it or in the middle of the night when she cries out.
He loved these when he was using a nub. they are supper easy to find when they fall out of his eye sight. perfect gift
He loved these when he was using a nub. they are supper easy to find when they fall out of his eye sight. perfect gift
This is the only brand of gum drop I will ever buy.  All the others (first years) are just different and my baby could tell.  This one is exactly like the one from the hospital and he would not even attempt to use the others.  The vanilla scent wasn't as strong as some of the other scented pacifiers out there and that was definitely a plus.  The scent was just enough to be soothing without being overpowering.
"Perfect texture and softness, yet durable.  The closest thing to a real nipple which is why I think my LO took to it (unlike every other pacifier I tried to give her).  The orthodontic shape is the natural shape made when she's sucking for comfort (versus breastfeeding), another reason I think she took to it.  I have 3 of them (2 for home and 1 for traveling) and will easily spend the $9 on more if they need replacing.  I also really like the groove for under the nose so it gives her room to breathe, as well as the size - it's big enough that she can find it in her crib in the middle of the night to self-soothe herself back to sleep.  And because it's soft everywhere, it doesn't wake her up if she rolls over it or turns her face onto it."
"These are the only pacifiers that my boys will use. They're well made and last a good long time (at least until my son bites through the rubber). You can also find these for a little cheaper at your local Wallyworld, but I prefer to buy them at Amazon for obvious reasons."
These are fantastic. My baby was given one at the hospital and now she won't use any other pacifier. She loves this thing.
"I received some Mam pacifiers as a baby shower gift.  They were 6m+ so when he was 6 months I washed them up and tried one.  He had been liking the Avent pacifiers so I didn't expect him to like these large, oddly shaped pacifiers- but he loved them!  I wasn't even sure what brand they were, so I asked around, and my day care provider knew it was a Mam.  I ordered more and he they are his faves!  He prefers over Avent and Nuk.  I read reviews and many other reviewers said their babies really liked these when they were teething.  Mine is definitely teething.  I'm not sure if that is why he likes them, or if its something else, but I swear by them now."
"My daughter never took to a pacifier, but she loved playing with the stuffed animal attached to it. She occasionally sucked on the pacifier when she was in the car, but mostly it was just a chew toy for her! Either way, she loved her WubbaNub! Easy to clean."
"My grand-daughters like the soft pacifier. Even now, 10 months they prefere it and chew on them happily! Good purchase!"
"They glow in the dark! It's a brilliant idea. These are not the only glow in the dark pacifiers on the market--others have thin glowing handles--but since the whole big MAM button glows, they are REALLY easy to see in the middle of the night, especially when sleepy, fumbling fingers drop them on the floor.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I held one under a lamp light for about fifteen seconds, then turned off the light and went to sleep. Two hours later when my baby woke it, it was still glowing...two hours after THAT, there was still a faint glow--just enough to see it if the rest of the room was completely dark, so you don't need a lot of light to get these &#34;charged&#34; for the night. If you are going to get MAM pacifiers anyway--you might as well forgo the &#34;regular&#34; ones and just get these!"
"It's fairly straightforward and simple, which is what we like about it.  It can hold 2 (maybe 3 if they're small and flexible) pacifiers.  The hanging portion of the holder has a 'split-ring' design so that it easy to hook onto our stroller or any other loop.<br /><br />It's made of stiff plastic, which actually works out well for us.  Because it keeps it shape, it has less of a chance of getting lost in the diaper bag.  Rather than using Ziploc bags, which always seemed a little 'eh' this works well.  It's also easy to stay organized--a pacifier in the case is clean, everything else is assumed to be dirty."
My baby girl looks so cool she loves it and this mommy loves it too! must buy for punk rockers
"Since our pacifiers came with their own clip-on covers, I actually use this for my nipple shield that is needed for me to breastfeed. It fits perfectly and is much better than the plastic baggie I had been using! It has a velcro closure and it's nice that the strap has a snap so you can hook it onto diaper bags, etc."
One of the best pacifiers for premiee babies. My daughter loves these and the vanilla scented smoothes her and while she was in the NICU it was a blessing.
its cute! its not exactly the same color as shown in the picture its a little darker for some reason it looks lavender to me on the picture but its actually very pink and cute!
My baby loves these! They have no cracks for dirt/germs to live in and they are super soft. She even likes to chew on the other side to soothe her gums from teething. I love that there is no BPA or BPS in them. A lot of BPA free pacifiers still contain BPS - which is JUST AS SCARY! Love the natural rubber!
"my son loves the MAM pacifiers.  they are the only ones he will use.  i've tried other brands, but continue to go back to these.  same thing with  my twin girls.  they turned every other pacifier away.  all three of my kids loved their MAMs."
It glows at night so you don't have to turn on a light to give baby the pacifier. Just as described.
"I ordered these pacifiers for my best friend's newborn son.  Although I wish I could have picked the color / pattern of the pacifiers, I am super happy with this product.  They are durable, well-sized, and adorable.  Not to mention, they pacify baby AND mom."
Got a lot of comments on this one and the baby liked it lots and lots and lots and lots!
These hello kitty pacifiers are so adorable!!! I can't wait to have my little one use it in her ill mouth :) if she doesn't like them I can always keep it to look at heh.
It's so cute and beautiful. It's a great gift and it liked so much. I will buy some more. Great article!
"Exactly what we got at the hospital,  which was what I was looking for. These are my baby's favorite Pacifiers."
"My sister-in-law thinks this is quite funny. They said that they intend to take pictures of their infant and send it to me, but from what I have heard they really love it."
It was a gift for my great nephew (who is 4 mos. old) and I've heard he loves it.  Plus it's great that when he spits out the pacifier the monkey keeps it from falling on the floor (usually).  We HIGHLY recommend it!!!!
"These are my son's favorite brand. Love the &#34;Air&#34; style where he doesn't have a ton of drool or moisture pressed against his face. Plus, you can see him smile through it. Great product.<br /><br />Comes with a sanitizing case so you add a little water, microwave it, they're completely disinfected."
"The Wubbanub Monkey is great!!! Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!! PRAISE the LORD for sleep!!!"
I ordered this for my two month old baby boy because every night when we put him to sleep he wanted his pacifier as comfort and every time his binky fell he would search for it with his eyes closed and when he did not find it that caused him to wake up and cry. With this WubbaNub Puppy it held the pacifier in place most of the time and gave us and him better sleep at night. We also lose a lot of pacifiers so the stuff animal made it easier for us to locate where we misplaced his pacifier. Would definitely purchase this again.
Very cute! Gender neutral and easy to locate in the dark - as opposed to the clear ones. This is baby's favorite pacifier.
Super cute.  Baby loves it.  Much cheaper online than in the stores.  Seems to be good quality.  We ended up buying a pink giraffe too because they work so well.
My son loves his puppy wubbanub! He's always had it but after he turned 2 we snipped off the pacifier so he could still snuggle with his puppy and rub the little ears on it. I think it made getting rid of the pacifier a much easier process! Every night he has to have his puppy :)
Bought this three years ago for my little girl as a newborn who didnt like pacifiers at all and she loved it. Hard to miss place with the toy attached as without it can get buried under her in the carseat or in the baby bag. Now that she is older she plays with the toy part with the pacifier disattached. Ordering the lamb for my newest addition as a xmas stocking stuffer. A must have product
My baby kept getting a rash where the pacifier sheild was against her face so we started giving her these at night. They fixed the problem within days.
"This is my lifesaver. We give this to our toddler during bedtime. She has used this since she was an infant and it is so useful because she could grab it and keeps it from falling from her mouth. This also makes the pacifier easier to find than the traditional ones when they fall under the table, out of her crib, etc."
"These are good quality, and work very well.  My son loves them and will take no other type of pacifier as a substite"
"When I first saw these I thought they were a little goofy.  I got this for my daughter, who was 6 months at the time & she loves it.  We take it everywhere.  Usually she sucks on the pacifier, but sometimes she chews on his legs or the tags, or just throws him around.  I've washed it in the washer a couple of times and it has held up well.  After 3 months of daily use there is no sign that the pacifier is anywhere close to detaching.  The lamb is small enough that I feel safe putting it in her bed with her to hold onto while she sleeps."
Love that there is no &#34;wrong way&#34; for baby to put in his mouth. Also love that it is made in the UK.
"We ordered these pacifiers for our little guy who was around 12 months at the time. He loves them! I really like the soft, gummy design and the way that you can see inside of them while they are in use. It's funny when he flips them around upside down. Due to the color pattern, it almost looks like he has a blue mustache :) I would definitely recommend these pacifiers to other moms/babies for the quality and design. They are great for older babies and young toddlers as they are designed for babies with teeth. Our son has 4 teeth right now so they're perfect."
I love these things.  I have a few in different shapes for my little girl so there is always one in the car or crib.  The best thing about them is they allow you to prop it in their mouth to lower the chances of it falling out when they are sleeping.
LOL this is hilarious. It's so &#34;gansta&#34;. I got this for my friend's baby shower. She had the mustache one. She couldn't stop cracking up.
"Good to keep the pacifier clean.  I keep it all the time in the baby carry bag.  Unfortunately, my grandson doesn't like the pacifier by the time he was 5 months old."
the calendar was just what i was looking for. there was a place to put your own pics for each month and the day spaces were big enough to write in.  was very happy it came in a plastic sleeve to store it in.
"this shampoo smells like the spa. plus, my 2 year old has never cried over it, so i can assume it is gentle on the eyes. i like knowing i'm using a safer product on her hair. plus, this huge bottle should last a long time."
love this crib and so glad i have it. came just as described and well built. fits perfectly and i can't live without it now :)
"it is so cute, but i am still expecting. Have to wait until my baby is born to put it on"
"My 4th baby was born tongue tied and lip tied.  She has to relearn to suck properly to breastfeed or bottle feed and  the soothies are the pacifier that was recommended for that.  A friend told me about the Wubbunubs, so I purchased two.  So stinking cute and our little one loves holding onto the stuffed animal part."
"Everyone should have these pacifiers!  They are perfect for babies who don't quite have a strong sucking grip and when they fall, they are easier to find (no rolling under the sofa!).  Throw in washing machine then rinse any soap residue off pacifier.  Very durable.  When my son was 1 year, I cut the paci off the mouth of the monkey and handed it to him when he went to bed...He started to put it in his mouth then realized the pacifier was gone then he just squeezed the monkey and laid down!  No more paci after that day and no issues!"
My son loves Dr. Browns binkeys and they said its good for 12 months plus.  My son is 18 months.  I know I should ween him off but he teethes so bad that I just cant take it away
"My Son Loved this item! He was not a paci baby, and I wanted to have one thing that he would enjoy to give me a little time... well this was it! The alligator shape was great too, easy for him to handle."
"This is an excellent product, at a very good price. I had looked all over for the newborn size.  It was just what I wanted!"
THIS IS AN ADORABLE ITEM. BABY HOLDS IT ON ITS OWN. ITS A NATURAL. BABY LOVES IT. A MUST HAVE
We love these Philips Avent Binky's. They are hard to find and are great to have around. We keep them all over the house as my daughter loves her Binky's.
My baby loved these! They were perfect for when he was little and they soothed him to sleep because of their design. I recommend!
"My daughter absolutely loves this pacifier. She clutches the adorable stuffed monkey like it is a life saver, and believe me, it is!!!"
These are great.  I wish every paci was glow in the dark.  Make it sooo much easier to find in the middle of the night when my baby looses his.
This wubbanub is great for helping my son keep it in his mouth. It isn't far if he spits it out and he can push it back in. Plus he likes to play with it to! Bought at 3 month old.
I have 10 month old twin boys and I got these when they were 2 months.  The plush toy makes it easy for the baby to find and put into his mouth.  It also keeps us from losing pacy's
"These are correct size to use for babies under 6 months. Cute colors, BPA free. Our daughter is happy with these. Review after 1 year: These become our daughters only pacifiers. She is more than a year old, and still using the same size. I had to replace them because they seem to disappear, but love that made of one piece of silicon, and easy to clean. Turned out we never had to go up in size. These are the best. Nice color, we tried all of them, and the green is the one that had been loved the most!"
"I love these pacifiers, they are wonderful and everyone recommends them. I love this product and will continue to purchase them for future baby showers."
"I'm not one of those moms that needs every new thing under the sun, but this is truly worth it's weight in gold!  I had gotten this when my daughter was 3 months old and it is so nice that when she starts fussing, the pacifier doesn't fall out of her mouth completely.  She's holding on to mr toutou, so once she's done fussing, she just sucks on the pacifier without me needing to put it back in her mouth.  This is also great for car rides.  When she wakes up in the car, he's right there for her.  No need to scream or have mommy reach back to find a pacifier and put it in! She's almost 5 months now and after seeing how well it worked, I bought a backup- Elliot the elephant, a replacement pacifier and the soft teethers that attach (not a necessity yet, but she still enjoys the textures).  Everything is high quality.  I would recommend this over the other brands that don't detach from the stuffed animal because the pacifier part needs to be washed off a lot in our pet friendly home and I think its gross to put a pacifier in the washer/dryer.  It would get nicks and cracks in it much easier and common sense says that's where bacteria likes to live.  The pacifier itself is very similar to our advent soothie pacifier and I never worry about it being pulled off the stuffed animal by her- it's secured by three round nubbins that push in to a soft plastic on the dogs head.  Even if it did fall off, it's the same exact size as her soothie.  I really recommend this product and will be ordering one for each and every baby shower I attend!"
"This binky is pricey but a great alternative to all the plastic your baby is probably already sucking on.<br /><br />If your kid is around others who have similar binkies, though, you'll have to label this somehow. You could attach it to a clip, for example, or put a dot at the base in permanent marker. We've &#34;lost&#34; a bunch of these during childcare since they look so similar to other natural rubber ones.<br /><br />Another drawback: Drop it in the middle of the night, and you'll never find it. Good luck if you kick it with a toe while your baby is in your arms. It will find a way across the room to the point of no return until you put the baby down and turn all the lights on (maybe). Do they make glow-in-the-dark pacifier clips? If they do, they're probably toxic, and your baby shouldn't be in the crib with a binkie clip anyway.<br /><br />I still give this 5 stars because it's so well made and a great plastic alternative."
Our Baby Boy loves these!!! He's 7 wks old and just starting to hang on to them .. These are very soft!
My baby loves these. Good price on this product. Same product you find in stores cheaper. Would purchase again and again
"These little wipes are fabulous. Not a strong smell and so convenient for when a binki  gets dropped. Clean well. Buy a few packages, you will need them."
These are the only pacifiers both of my children will take. I love them. They are very soft and come in different sizes for different ages. The different colors are nice so we can tell whos is whos.
Arrived quick and was exactly what I was expecting! Looks hilarious! It is a must have for every single baby.
"It's super cute, but the best part is how much my niece loves her ducky. I think every baby should have one."
"It is hilarious. I bought 2 for my brother's twins and they look good in the box. It is a Xmas gift, so they haven't tried it yet, but everybody who saw them so far laughed, so it is a good sign :)"
Item was exactly what we were looking for.  My son loved it and my wife was happy as the different colors allowed her to color coordinate more outfits to pacifiers as well.
My baby is really happy with these. I think it has to do with the fact that the nipple is flat not rounded. I like the clear look - really slick design.
"Only pacifier that works. I now what to reorder, but the picture shows a bottle????<br /><br />What am I ordering, the item name or what's on the picture??? :-)"
"we used this mattress for the first time when my son was 16m old for an overnight at grandma's house. he dislikes the pack n play, but on this mattress he slept like a stone. we placed it on the pnp boards and covered it with a waterproof pad and a standard store-brand playard sheet we've used a thousand times before. it fit perfectly. i didn't find this to be too firm, too soft, too small or too noisy. (i feel like a lot of reviewers really overthink these things!) it's just a portable-sized version of his crib mattress. recommended."
"this doll is exactly what i wanted for my daughter's first dolly. it is adorable, perfect size, light, very soft, durable, and the hair is divinely soft. she isn't cheap looking at all.<br />i am so glad i chose this doll for my daughter's first birthday after looking at all the dolls and being on the fence for a long time. my daughter loves her and carries her easily around all the time."
very portable. very strong. and very light at the same time. my daughter loves it. i bought two. i am glad it is part of my daughter's life.
brought this for my nephew love that it came on time and well packaged.. happy with it. good price love that i can shop on line..
it is a great quality product. the water does not leak from the bottle which is a problem i have when i have the bottles in the diaper bag. the best part is the price. sometimes you buy high end bottles and the babies don't even like the nipples.
"i have one of these between the living room and kitchen. it's great! well made and easy to install. also a reasonable price. i much  prefer these to closed doors , my animals can be  kept off company without being left out ."
great for the cold. super warm. never had to be one of those parents chasing a tossed out blank or trying to remember it. this is great for the winter time.
"i purposely sought these out and found them on amazon after owning a set prior. i don't know why i didn't review the item earlier. anyway, the tops and silicone valves are interchangeable with other playtex sets.  i liked the smaller size because who needs an 8 oz cup of milk or juice when your kid hits toddler hood??? i didn't want her to have to bend her head back super far just to drink what's on the bottom. love these so much!"
"my two-month-old loves this! i don't think she really enjoyed it until she was over a month old. now at two-months, she's enjoying it even more. she especially likes the apple with the mirror. she'll look at that for five or ten minutes while i'm doing some quick clean up or grabbing a bite to eat. she also bats at the other animals and makes them jingle.<br /><br />i've used this a lot and it's machine washable (mostly), which makes for easy cleaning. :)"
"great price for the silicone tubing, durable, and very easy to use and disinfect if you use the medela microwave disinfection bags"
good little caddy for our babyjogger.  please with the quality to price ratio.  the top edge has a wire running around it so it keeps its shape for the most part.
"we ordered the large diaper bag for our two children (age 22 months and 2 months). this has been super handy to have for all of our cloth diapers and cloth wipes. it's good for home use, but as we travel a lot it has been really helpful for use on the road. thus far, there has been no leaking and no odor from this bag. we previously purchased a smaller bag from this company which is more useful to hold wet clothes (only for 1 child for us) or a single cloth diaper. i would recommend this bag to anyone that is cloth diapering as it has made things way easier."
great product! it was what i expected.<br />amazing quality... easy to assemble and drive. if you want a good stroller this is it!
the book ends are adorable and the colors are perfect!  the workmanship is fine and the shipping was done in a timely manner. packaging assured the product arrived in perfect condition.
"halo sleep sacks are the best for swaddling infants. i have tried several other brands, but my sons have always been able to break free from them. yes, the velcro is loud, but if the velcro wasn't strong enough the baby would break out in seconds and then it would be pointless. i really like the material of this particular sleep sack, it's nice and light (but not too light) and perfect for semi-chilly spring and fall nights. also the pattern is really appealing. five stars for this one."
begins to fit a child right around 17-18 lbs. still a little loose for our little guy but the size ones fit him still (16 lbs chunk) and look so slimming for a cloth cover
bought this for my five year old nephew. i have not heard any complaints. plus he likes the blue color.
"i currently own the dreamlites bear for my baby girl and love it, but it does not play any sounds.  this was less expensive, much much cuter, and offers more functions than many others i had looked at buying.  she loves the soft sounds including the rain, heart beat, and nature all of which have three volume choices and an auto shut off feature.  it is very pretty in her room and just the right size.  it is soft to the touch but for the lights shell and is simply a great addition to her room and her bed time routine!  it is a perfect purchase.  we love it!!"
"one of the best items we have as new parents.  we did not want to have to run an almost empty dishwasher every day to sanitize bottles, nipples, etc.  with this, you fill the bottom with any type of bottle, throw nipples in the top (you can literally throw them in there).  you fill the bottom ring with distilled water, plug it in and press the button on the bottom.  it runs for about 10 minutes at a very high temperature (lots of steam).  turns off automatically.  nice and sterile."
my baby smiles at this thing first time we used it.  he also &#34;talks&#34; to all his friends.  the music only is nice for putting to sleep.  only negative- the music sounds like it needs batteries already after a few uses
"this belt is awesome.  it is soft and fits around my belly at the top, middle and bottom because the velcro is adjustable.  i love being able to fall asleep to the same music as my baby because they include a splitter and earbuds for me.  the belt includes 2 volume controls; 1 for baby and 1 for me.  i would recommend this product and will probably buy it for other expectant mothers."
"my two month old breastfed baby would not take any of the half dozen bottles i tried - including ones with natural nipples such as tommy tippee and avent. i researched and found these bottles and with three days to spare before i was to return to work we finally got the little guy to take a bottle. it was truly a miracle. these are not only shaped correctly, but they are more malleable as well, which we found was the problem with the other &#34;natural&#34; ones. my son is now four months old and a champ at using these bottles, so we thought we'd give the other ones a try again since we already owned them. the other ones are still a no-go, so i'm stocking up on more of these. i only have two tiny gripes - the cap is a little hard to snap into place and it's very hard to read the measurements on the side of the bottle. but these issues are insignificant because all that matters is he's actually able use these! if you are transitioning your breastfed baby to a bottle try these first. i am so incredibly thankful i found these."
"baby loves it. good loud rattle. i wish the colors were brighter/more vibrant, but thats not a deal breaker in any way."
"these are a little expensive, but they are worth it. they cover more area than most other ones & the are made well. they look & feel like they will last 50 years. i get asked about them anytime someone sees them in my truck. i worry less now about my rear seats getting messed up."
this a great way to keep my baby warm without having to turn the heat up in the house...a must have!!!
we absolutely love this crib! it's small enough that we can fit it in our bedroom but large enough he has room to grow. at eight months and twenty one pounds that is really important to us!
"it's a great little seat.  very sturdy and easy to travel with.  plus, it's very secure and safe... no other seat can restrain my 2yr old boy."
these covers are great for small leaks and they wash well. they can go in the washer and the dryer so you don't have to pick them out of the laundry. i use them with my child and as a teacher of toddlers i suggest them to parents when there child is still learning to toilet.
"i purchased them for my daughter who is still going through potty training.<br /><br />they are very cute, and work well for potty training and long trips away from home.  my child likes wearing undies and it's nice to know that her clothes will be spared (depending on the liquid intake).  i like to pare them with gerber training undies to allow for extra absorption on long trips away from home.<br /><br />they wash well, and dry well.  in my opinion they are sized a bit larger compare to gerber, but still work well.  if you child it's average size, i would recommend ordering a size down."
this hamper is ridiculously cute and practical.  i have it in my son's bedroom.  the design is great...would love to see them get even more animal designs.
"these little things are hard to come by. the overpriced baby store in town didn't have them. the wal-place didn't have them. amazon to the rescue! they got here in two days, and the pump is now happily helping to provide milk to my offspring once more."
"works great, look fine in the kitchen, easy to clean.  holds ample amount of items, different bottles all fit fine and nothing has fallen off."
"my favorite bottle cleaner.  med soft bristles easily bend to get into a small bottle top, then bristles on top reach edges easily on the inside.  tried a couple others that were just annoying.  this one is our favorite!  the stand was nice and helpful to keep it clean and dry"
"i have been using the cuisinart bottle sterilizer for the past month, and am very happy with this purchase. the bottom rack can hold up to six bottles (including oversized ones such as my comotomo and mimijumi bottles), and the top rack can hold assorted pump components/pacifiers/etc. it takes less than 10 minutes to run a cycle, and it's simple to run. just pour a measured amount of water in, using the measuring cup that stores in the lid, and turn the knob to &#34;on.&#34; when it has completed its cycle, i just pour the remaining water down the sink -- everything stays very clean."
best mirror! large enough to be able to see baby clearly. easy to adjust. doesn't distort the image like others out there.
this seat is so easy to adjust and is relatively easy to install as well. the material is super easy to clean and is very easy to get our son in and out of. we are definetly buying another one for our latest addition!
i wanted a shirt for my son where the logo wasn't huge and overbearing...  it's just the right size.  i got the 3t.
the brushes are perfect for little mouths. one for the kid to play with and one for mommy to do the job.
fits perfectly on my mini cooper countryman's seats perfectly.  prevents my munchkin from destroying my seats.  seems tough and well made.
"my daughter is 6 months old, 26.5&#34;.  she fits perfectly in this sleepsack.  she loves it because it is soft, warm, and comfortable.  plenty of leg room too."
"i purchased this item for my 1-year old to use at daycare when she takes a nap. it is a very nice quality blanket for the price; so nice that i considered keeping it at home. it's very soft, a nice thickness and a good size. my daughter loves to snuggle with this blanket. it is a cute cheetah print and would make a nice shower gift."
this is the best gate i have ever used.  when i put it up it was kind of hard but now that it is up i love it.
it came quickly and looked exactly like the picture. the tubing fit and it was cheaper than ordering directly from medela
"i bought the original version and the zipper never really worked, resulting in lots of failed attempts to make the zipper catch and plenty of dried out wipes. i contacted the company and was told  there was a new version addressing the zipper problem. they sent one out very quickly free of charge (great customer service). the new zipper is metal instead of plastic, and after a couple months, we've had no problems. i love being able to put this in the diaper bag instead of a huge bag of wipes or a clunky hard plastic case. i've found a new baby shower gift."
i have used one for 6 years with two grandchildren.  it has been a blessing to my old knees!!!  very easy to set up.
"cute and cleverly folded card. perfect for baby shower thank you notes. i wish there were more notecards similar to this one. hint, hint."
"got this for a baby shower gift for my daughter-in-law, had been recommended by a client.  this is a great gift, easy to set up and take down, perfect for taking along for visiting and just the right size for a newborn up to a year."
"i love this sponge. it is very affordable, cute, and fits perfect in my safety first tub. i highly recommend this. with out last child, we used a sponge and it has made bath time with a newborn much happier."
perfect as trash bag liners to the hanging trash bags in my boat's heads! exactly the right size. wish it didn't have printing on it.
sophie is the teething choice in our family. a real winner with all the grandchildren. great toy even for just play time.
any a+a blanket is my favorite! our daughter has several of the dream (4 layers of muslin) blankets. they're perfect for tummy time and we also use it for her to lay on in general.
"i am very happy with this baby gate. i have the gate at the bottom of my stairs and it has taken a lot of slamming shut from the kids, and is still holding strong a year later. the gate looks new still, good strong quality."
love the look and feel of this sheet! has held up well too. my favorite of all the crib and bassinet sheets we own.
"very well made and sturdy!  i got this for my visiting grandson, so it will be perfect to grow with him, from high chair to booster seat.  the colors are very nice too - neutral enough to go with anything."
Absolutely love this.  Bought a changing table from a big retail store that needed a pad.  Bought this and it fits perfectly.  Also bought the changing pad washable covers and I feel very comfortable when changing my daughter (and so does she).
"Love these things! Our daughter took it everywhere with her, and it made it easy to find and keep track of, and it stays in place!"
"We love the wubbanub pacifiers.  When my son falls asleep, I had to search his basinet for the regular pacifiers, but with the wubbanub, it is always on his chest or right beside him.  He's 2 months old now and he's starting to grab it and play with it. So, that kills two birds with one stone."
Best thing ever for infants!  Easy to find and rarely lose.  Plus it's cute.  Like the giraffe the best because it's easiest to find in nighttime.
Very good product!!!!I have been using it on my baby and he is now 6 months old....Thank you very much
I've given these to all my pregnant friends. Babies don't lose their pacifiers because they are holding onto the toy. Super durable. You need to order two so that when one is in the washing machine they have the other one!
This was a hit at the baby shower!  Everyone loved it and laughed so hard and asked where I bought it!
"My baby loves these.  He was using the newborn size, but I thought since he was getting bigger, I wanted one that fit his mouth.  Very happy with these and would recommend to anyone."
I already reviewed the giraffe but I simply cannot say enough good things about WubbaNub! My son loves to hold the animal and bite on the sides of the Soothie. I always know where his pacifiers are. Worth the $13 or whatever.
Bought this for my sons 1st birthday party. He actually liked using it as his pacifier for the whole afternoon.<br />I recommend this
Worked wonderfully for keeping pacifier in baby's mouth while lying on back in swing. Probably would work well in car seat too.
"We bought a lot of different kinds, but my son loves this kind. At first time I bought it just for fun. Very good quality. Made in Germany. Love it!"
"Perfect deal, faster shipment, recommended to all, A++++++++<br />I made a comparison with similar and for me this was the best choice and the purchase was great."
My son absolutely adores this. I had tried the soothies at first when he was a newborn and he hated them. We ended up having to do NUK pacifiers. However I ordered this for car rides hoping he'd take it and would be easier so I wouldn't have to practically dislocate my arm to get the pacifier back in his mouth.<br /><br />It has actually turned into his favorite pacifier!! I want to get a few more pairs! It's easy to find the pacifier too in those panic moments. At times when he wants the NUK pacifier he still likes to cuddle his dragon. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!<br /><br />When we got this I washed the whole thing in soap and water and let it air dry. Some of the red dye washed off but it didn't lose significant color that I noticed. Then I dipped the pacifier in boiling water just to be thorough.
Just what I wanted. My baby loves them. Won't use any other. After I bought in pink and purple - just as great
MAM is the best pacifier out there for breast fed babies! I have purchased MANY of these with having 3 kids. They each take/took them well. Now I give them to expecting moms as part of their shower gift.
best bib we ever had.  it locks in place so my boy can't take it off anymore by himself.  easy to clean and catches a lot of food too!
"this was a gift that was one of my daughter's favorites. it entertains the baby while in the car seat, and can be easily taken off and used anywhere. i have purchased it for every new mom since."
"granddaughter loves it and it fits perfectly in her lunch box.  also, mom and dad have those chop stick 'cheaters' that hold them in the right position for learning to use them.  there's enough room in case for them too!  yay!"
"my 3mo old is not really into pacis or her thumb, but this is the only one that seems to soothe her and almost instantly put her to sleep. we are happy with the quality, and we recommend the product."
kids will love this everytime they take a bath/shower. fun to have and great for gifts for new parents! i purchased several for the bathrooms and grandparents house too. easy to put on facet!
the sheet fits the mattress well. nice color. it is soft to touch and washes well. good quality for the price.
we bought two of these for our nursery because we are expecting twins. the shipping was a little bit of a hassle since this item is not shipped by ups or fedex. amazon uses a different carrier for their large items.<br /><br />the cribs came packaged well and the shipper was very courteous. after unboxing them all the items were all in good order and i did not see any damage. all the pieces were accounted for.<br /><br />i would recommend using a battery powered screwdriver to assemble this. all that is provided is an allen wrench. i would also recommend having someone to help. some of the pieces are hard to assemble with just one person.<br /><br />the assembly went well and quick. all the pieces fit together well and i had not problems at all. the instructions are a big sticker on the base part of the crib. they are a little hard to understand.<br /><br />after the cribs were together they looked amazing! they are very sturdy and well built. the standard crib mattress fit in with no issues. i do like the fact that it has 3 adjustable heights.<br /><br />the only complaint i have is these do have a smell after they come out of the box. they have been together and in the nursery for 3 weeks. they smell is going away. i would definitely recommend putting these together before the baby comes.
"We got this lamb as a gift when my daughter was born.  She started sleeping with &#34;Winky,&#34; as we still call him, when she was seven months old.  Now she is 4 1/2 and he is still her favorite thing to sleep and snuggle with.  The lamb gets a LOT of love and has held up wonderfully!  This purchase was made so that she would have one to keep at daycare."
Might seem a little pricey for a pacifier but you'll spend twice that amount replacing pacifiers that you're lost. You won't lose these because they don't pop out of the baby's mouth and fall on the floor. Easy to find in the diaper bag or purse.
Love It!! We also have the little lamb. My grand daughter is two months old and already she holds on to it. And it's a life saver because you can always keep track of it.
These are the greatest things!! My son loves his binky and so having a big animal on the other end helps him from dropping it on the floor and makes it easy for him to pick up and put in his mouth on his own. I put it in his crib at night and he can pick it up and put it right in his mouth. I had to buy two of these things because they are so great!
Great for one pacifier.  I attach it  to the car seat and it stays put.  It's easy to clean and I love it.  It's my favorite pacifier holder
"Great value, these are my daughters favorite pacifiers because they are identical to the ones the hospital provides. Awesome buy!"
My daughter loved these binkies.  It is like a toy and binky all in one.  She was able to grasp thing faster.  She might not had the binky part all the time but she would grab the cow toy with her hands.
My daughter loved these binkies.  It is like a toy and binky all in one.  She was able to grasp thing faster.  She might not had the binky part all the time but she would grab the cat toy with her hands.
I use these wubbanub pacies for my babies in their bed because it is easier to find it at night. I love them for that reason!
my baby loves this she wont go to sleep without it glad i purchased this it is cute and easy to find when they drop the pacifier
Granddaughter ADORES it! I believe it is her favorite to have! Well worth the cost for a child to enjoy so much!
Very cute and durable. My daughter loves the little animals and she cuddles with them to. A++++ product and would get them again
"The best pacifiers, but you already knew that. Buy a dozen as half of them will end up under the couch."
Our 3 month old LOVES her lambie! We always have it with us and she even holds onto it when she doesn't want the binky in her mouth. The little legs make it easy for her to grab onto... It's a nice little security item for her. Obviously a plus that lambie helps to keep the binky from falling to the ground.
"I love knowing my son is getting the best when it comes to natural pacifiers. We've had these for a few months now and they've held up perfectly. They do turn darker once they're washed in hot water. But, this doesn't have any wear and tear on them."
"My toddler seems very happy with the AVENT pacifiers. Somehow, the price seems more reasonable than the other AVENT ones."
"Good product for a good price, with 2 pacifier! My baby like it! My baby boy likes to hold the pacifier with his owns hands so is anatomic"
"My baby loves this pacifier! I love the simple look and quality of the rubber. This is very durable, so far this pacifier has had no cracks or pieces broken."
"My son loves these pacifiers! When he was newborn, I could spread the legs out on top of his little swaddled body and it would help keep the pacifier in his mouth and help him find it again easily before he was able to use his hands. In the Car, it is MUCH easier to find when you can't see (for example, searching the crib in a dark room or with one hand reaching to carseat in the back while driving). He did go through a short phase when he was learning to grasp where he would pull it out of his mouth and not be able to get it back in, but as he got older it because much easier for him to put these back in at night without waking up."
The dragon became one of my son's favorite pacifiers. It's bright and harder to loose. My son loves the wubbaNub
Got this for my newborn who loves the soothie pacifiers. He already puts his arm around the little froggie. I'm sure he will grow to love his little wubbanub!
these work great. have had to replace some here and there from our son pulling on the too many times. these were the only drawer locks we could use on our cabinets. other brands that needed to screwing didn't fit the way our cabinets were made. (drawers have sliding cutlery drawers...no room to attach other brands)
"excellent mattress pad. it is really thick and soft when put on and of course it protects the mattress itself from stains. so i would presume this is a win-win. :) overall, great product and quick delivery."
"this high chair is superb. it acts as a high-chair, a swing, and a recliner. my toddler daughter still enjoys this chair tremendously, despite not having liked the swing mode when she was a baby. from a parental point of view, there are many positive features, and a couple of negatives. we have been using it for 19 months without any major issues, and i think we will be able to use it for at the very least another year. i bet that we will be able to sell it for a substantial amount when we are done with it, because it has held up really well. we're clearly big fans of this product, and we went on to purchase the car seat, which has also turned out to be a fantastic product.<br /><br />positives:<br />the chair and cover are easily cleaned<br />it is solid and well designed so that it won't break or fall over<br />it folds up to occupy very little floor space (this was really important when we were in a small apartment)<br />it looks and feels great (it feels like soft padded leather, not plastic or imitation velvet like so many others)<br />the table surface is easy to clean<br />the design of this unit is spectacular, and it's really well thought out<br /><br />negatives:<br />the removable tray has plastic alignment pins that don't line up well with the handle brackets<br />the rotating plastic pieces that the plastic alignment pins fit into are cheap and often partly pull out<br />the locking mechanism on the wheels is sometimes difficult to release when moving the unit<br />the levers on the sides for unlocking the base (so that it can fold) are difficult to activate"
"this is the best set for a little one. specifically, i buy it for the comb. it gets out all the tangles but doesn't scratch my little ones head. the brush was good when she had little hair because the bristles are so soft it was nice on her head. now it just makes her hair frizzy."
"bought it for my son and daughter-in -law and our new grand daughter . kids love it it with the removable car seat, and baby carrier. they also like the hood over the baby carrier. they use the stroller daily on walks. over all a very good system."
the perfect baby food maker! this is so much fun to use! i made so many batches of baby food!
"fits crib perfectly well with square corners. nice and firm on infant side, softer on the toddler side.  high quality product"
"we've been using this projector for over a year now and love it! the music is soothing, which was great during the long nights of nursing. now that our daughter is a toddler, she loves flipping the pages, turning the night light on and off, and just laying there watching the images on the ceiling. if she wakes up at night, she just turns on the music by herself, and falls back asleep. the remote is a great extra feature. we are expecting another baby, and i will be getting the same projector for him/her as well."
"very sturdy and kept the car seat clean while travelling.  i've now used it about 3 times for international travel and still in good shape. also, there's enough room to put a couple small items once the car seat is in."
"very durable, bright colors, relatively easy to assemble if you don't have baby brains.  read the directions if you cannot get it up or down. we obviously skipped a step. my daughter loves sleeping in it. the only negative i have is i wish the flowers that hang down were attached by buttons instead of velcro....they just fall off. i'm sure this will come in handy for many years to come!"
great. you can see the entire inside of the car with this mirror. crystal clear. easy to attach. good product.
"my son loves this, he jumps for 30 minutes at a time in this. perfect gift, he is 7 months old."
"a cute and simple baby shower game that got many laughs! just know that it all comes on one sheet, so you must cut out the pacifiers beforehand."
love the product.  it makes my kitchen looks very organized and pretty.  i use it for regular dishes that cannot go into the dishwasher.
very excited to get this bank for our little girls room. can't wait until she finally makes her arrival into the world!
"easy to adjust very comfortable,  zipper and with added extension for wider apart breasts.  also have halter straps so don't put it on too tight and cause clogged duct, just use the halter straps!"
"perfect for my 20 month old, who is approx 26 lbs. warm and comfortable for my little guy. great purchase for parents who do not want to use loose blankets in their little one's crib."
"the inside surface is sealed and waterproof. stitching is present on the outside surface, so if the changing pad needs a good hosing, you will have to let it dry. regardless, it closes easily and is quite portable, fitting into any sort of diaper bag or really even a purse."
"easy to assemble.  nothing works 100% of time but this works most of the time.  my baby loves the vibration, and this kind of rock itself if she's moving in it.  there's only 1 thing, i wish it was more of a hammock.  the plastic insert give my baby back support but she hates that she can't kick her legs straight that her weight keeps pushing her down.  but on most day when she's calm this works.  someone will probably call me a bad mom but i use this only when i'm sitting right next to her, --i put her on her side with an extra blanket to pad the bottom."
everything i expected i loved this product just as much as i loved the movie the lion king when i was a kid.
my baby refused to sleep on hard surfaces like the pnp mattress. this sheet gave it a nice plush softness and cushion so that she'd finally take a nap.
"super duper cute.  my little girl is going to love it at christmas.  if i know her, she'll be wearing it all the time."
we've been using this product for about a week now and so far so good! the foam pieces are a little on the thin side but because there are so many in a pack i just put two on the door and it works great (previous reviews mention this as well). you can't beat the price on these and they're super cute for kids. they store very easily on the door knob when not in use.
this is a very nice high chair.  babies sit very comfortable in it.  the tray is easy to handle and the chair itself fold up nice and neat.  stands by itself and can be stored very easily.  i was very impressed with how easy it unfolds and folds up.  the wheels make it very portable and the adjustable seat height is nice.  i cannot find anything about it that i don't like and our grandson seems to feel the same way! :)
I am very pleased and this was a good purchase.  I bought it for my granddaughter.  She was very happy!
My baby wasn't big on the pacifiers. We tried pretty much every brand out there and these are all she would take. We are still using mam at 3 months and loving them.
"These are soooo adorable. I got it for a baby shower gift, but have used several myself. Any baby I have had loves them. Quality is great and it is the Original Soothe pacifier."
Dr. Brown makes the best pacifiers.  My son loves the size and shape of the nipple.  He sleeps with then everynight.
Baby loves these!  She was a little bit on the low birth weight side and we were having a hard time finding something that would fit her tiny mouth.  These fit the bill!  They are nice and soft and she has no problem with them.  She is a breast fed baby and hasn't had any problem so far (introduced the paci around 3 weeks).
"I love these, they work just like the regular green ones, but I like that my daughter has various colors to match her outfits :)"
Love these things! I wish I would have known about these for my 1st child! I have used these for my youngest since she was born and she loves them. We havn't lost one and she can easily spot them in any room. I have bought them as baby shower gifts and people always ask when I got them.
"My baby loved her frog and now her Dragon. We took them both to the Houston Renaissance Festival and everyone loved it!<br /><br />Well made and exactly the colors shown. It is easy for her to grab the little feet and is easy to find at night when you are randomly groping in a crib for a pacifier. If you feel the soft happiness, it's your wubbanub. It's small enough that I don't have to worry about it smothering her and perfect for travel. Way easier to find than a normal pacifier.<br /><br />I love them so much, I am getting them for my friends with small babies for Christmas."
"even though I got these for my daughter, they still make her very happy, so it makes me very happy"
...what more can you say?  This pacifier is both functional and hilarious.  Sometimes my infant would play with this on her own and when we would look over and she would randomly have it in her mouth.  She could never figure out why we were laughing at her and grabbing for the camera.  SO worth the price!
I use these to clean parts between pumping at work and they work great.  Essential item for pumping bag.  I wouldn't use regular wipes but since these are food grade they are safe.
This is a cute one... I got it for my sis-in law I hope she and her husband likes it and most important her baby (who is not even born yet) likes it :-d
"This worked great for my son, but he just does not like pacifiers.  Neither of my boys did.  It was nice to be able to tuck it into a blanket to keep it in his mouth though when he was little."
"Love these.  The animal provides a little weight so an infant doesn't spit it out.  Also, easy for them to find in the crib at night."
"My baby isn't picky when it comes to pacifiers. These suit her just fine, and I love that they come with tops/plastic enclosures. This way we can travel with them or keep them in a pocket without worrying about getting them dirty."
My little one loves his wubbanub!<br />It was so perfect when he was an infant because you can lay the animal on their chest and the paci wont fall out of their mouth when they stop sucking like other pacis so you don't have to put it back in their mouth 10 times in the middle of the night.<br />Now that he older he carries it around and its hard to lose.
"My grandson loves it and also WebbaNub Clifford. These were so much easier for him to put back in his mouth than just the pacifier which would disappear in his crib or stroller.<br /> Sometimes he carries around both!! Altho, now he is 14 months old and still is carrying them around."
"My grandson loves the wubba he holds on to the little giraffe ,so cute to watch him with his wubby"
My daughter loves these pacifiers.  The size is perfect for her 4 month old mouth.  The design ensures her nose is not blocked by the plastic shield.
This is one of my favorite purchases for my newborn son! The shape and size of the dino are perfect to rest on his chest and hold the pacifier where it needs to be so my son can reach it! He also likes to hold onto the dinos body. I am thrilled with this wubbanub and would recommend it to anyone!
Exactly what I was wanting and needing for a baby shower! I received it quickly also which was a HUGE plus!! The baby LOVES it too!!
"Closest I can find to the old 60s-80s pacifiers, to use for authentic vintage clothing and accessories for doll collection.  They're sturdy, and have the non-orthodontic nipple (slightly 'bulbed' at the end)."
"First time grandmother cannot give grandson anything but the best....and this is it.  He and his mom LOVE the Wubbanub because not only is it a quality pacifier, but Mr. Giraffe and Mr. Monkey keep it within easy reach of baby."
"My daughter is 5 months now and this is her favorite, we lost it and am now buying another. she loves to hug it as she sleeps, it is small enough to fit in her hands but big enough to find when you lay it down some where.<br />We have the loose ones that we put the cords on but the can get wrapped around her neck."
"My baby would only take the Soothie pacifier, which was tough bc it would fall out every 3 seconds. This had been a godsend bc he loves it just as much and the shape is so much more conducive to his face. If only I could find it in a store but at least w my Prime account it's the next best thing!"
"For some reason my baby doesn't care for these. They are a great product, soft silicone, flexible, sturdy and well-made.. Your baby may love it, who knows?"
"LOVE THESE!!!  You'll never lose another pacifier again!  Well, at least until they're 6 mths....so wish they would make the next age group of paci's and stiffness available in these!  I adored them and my daughter had nearly 5 mths of struggle trying to switch to just the plain soothies when she outgrew these younger stiffness wubbanubs.  She still throws a fit when they're in the store but unfortunately even at 20 mths they just chew them apart."
My baby loves these.  I really like that they are natural rubber.  So far its holding up well and she uses it every day.  It has not caused any nipple confusion either with breast feeding.
"much better value over the 3.5 inch screen.  you will never say, &#34;i wish i had a larger image and less battery life.&#34;  we don't keep it on all the time.  on, check, off.  the batteries last for weeks if you do this.  i recommend the 2 camera pack instead.  i wish they had that when i bought this."
"this chair is seriously the cutest thing ever!! i am so excited for my son to open it for his bubble guppies themed 2nd birthday party!! i can't even deal with how adorable it is!! it's seriously just as adorable in person!! he's completely obsessed with bubble guppies, so i know this chair will get a lot of use!"
my daughter-in law said this was the best thing that she has gotten for gifts...she would not know what to do without it..i bought another one just in case he spits up on it at night she would have a back up one.
totally awesome product any baby would love this great value for money and helps soothe difficult babies that find it hard to self soothe
"great car seat, highly recommend.  our daughter is tall for her age, and the size of this is perfect.  price was very affordable too!"
product works great when putting new born in a swing. supports the head very nice. it is also a great value for the price.
"love having my grandson read to me, and the plus side he does it and doesnt realize it is helping him in school"
very easy to put together and my baby loves it so far.  good quality and very sturdy.  i can't wait until he starts jumping on in.  a must buy if you are looking for a great product.  we bought the exersaucer but will return it as the quality is very poor compared to the jamperoo.
this is one of the greatest ways to save a child knees. what a perfect invention to create for a new started of crawling.
the easy wash cover fits even the largest shopping carts and the toy straps keep toys from falling on the floor.
my daughter 17 months and still loves it she has a blast. and u can adjust the height for growth weve had it frm age 8 months. shes occupied for hours and infriont of tv she spins in circle stands up ands pins rocks ect allows me to allow her to play and me to clean or mommy time i added more toys alsdo with toy links plus folds dwn to be put away or to easily transport to grandparents when they babysit indoors and outdoors. my 2yr old nephew meets the weight requirement and we put him in it as well we put seat all the way up and he loves it to
love these baby blankets - simple design - so soft - breathable - great for summer months - much larger than normal receiving blankets.  i always buy these for gifts for friends/family who are having babies.  one of the best baby blankets out there.
best money i ever spent on a baby gate. we used this pen for over a year from the time my daughter began walking till she was old enough to figure out how to climb out. it is large and roomy so she always had a lot of space to play and it held up great. it was wonderful for when i needed to cook in the kitchen as i could watch her easily while she played in her pen. highly recommend this product.
i purchased one of these off of my friend's babiesrus registry for her baby shower. she loved it so much that when i needed a new chair i decided to get one of these from amazon (cheaper!).
such a cute sheet for such a great price. designer sheets are 20-30 bucks a piece and thus one us just as cute! perfect for my nursery.
love this thing.. easy to put on and to slip baby into with one free hand. i definitely recommend it!
"product of excellent quality, cost, utility, very practical, lightweight, lightweight, very well packaged and rapidly reach the destination highly recommended for the purchase of other customers."
love them they are my favorite love the brand as a whole. i love that they are snap and dont catch on everything in the wash.
"my wife loves the relief these nursing cups provide. she wished she would have had these for her first two pregnancies. they are hard plastic, but not completely hard. they are soft enough to be comfortable, yet still sturdy enough to keep their shape while worn. however, regardless of what the box says, it is probably not a good idea to wear these in public. they are more suitable for home use, unless you plan on wearing a jacket."
ordered this dispenser to keep my facial wipes in.  it is perfect!!!!  it holds a little or a lot and dispensed only 1 at a time every time.  the secret is the weighted piece that lays on the wipes and holds all of them down except the 1 you are pulling.  it also helps to keep the wipes from drying out.  this works great and i love it--i just wish they made a heated one that dispensed warm wipes (for the winter).
these were very soft and a nice material that wont sleep too hot!  best pj's i've bought so far!  they are super adorable!
this gives us great piece of mind! we sleep so much better now that we have the snuza! this is my favorite baby product!
my baby love it a lot enjoy it since he born. i bougth 2 more for gift my nephews love it too
"i love these bibs! we have several of the larger sizes for our toddler so when baby no.2 arrived, i bought some smaller ones to use when he starts solids. they wipe up easy and last forever! super cute designs too! well worth the price."
i bought this for my son when he was about 2 years old so he could sit at the big table with everyone else.  very easy to put together (took about 30 minutes or less) - my son actually helped me do it one morning together.  the chair now has anti-tip plastic pieces that go on the back on the legs on the bottom.  we use it on tile floor and if he pushes the chair back from the table - it definitely will not tip.  he loves being at the table with everyone and having his own chair.<br />the only complaint is that the straps are not super easy to adjust and not easily (or may not be at all) removable from the chair in order to wash if things get spilled on them.  other than that i love the chair and would purchase again and again.<br />we've had the chair for about 4 months now - the finish on the walnut chair holds up great.  it is a very very nice quality chair.
i used this small chandelier in my daughter's super small closet conversion nursery. it is spectacular especially with the pendent we added above painted in the same black color. she's 4 1/2 months now and it works great. we also set up a dimmer which is really nice to add a bit of light instead of a giant flash. she loves how the shadows fall on the walls. if you need a small chandelier this is a great one!
very good system. i used it to monitor my elderly ill mother. the motion feature assured she would not wander.
"we bought this to put in the tub for my son (9 months) after searching high and low for a bath mat that wasn't a crazy shape or didn't have a ton of cartoony, baby images all over it. this is the perfect fit! it's much larger than most of the &#34;baby bath mats&#34; you'll find and it was a lot less expensive. good quality material and not too thick, we roll it up and take it with us when we visit family and we barely notice it in the luggage."
"i love these bibs! we have several of the larger sizes for our toddler so when baby no.2 arrived, i bought some smaller ones to use when he starts solids. they wipe up easy and last forever! super cute designs too! well worth the price."
"so, so, so good!  these plates are so sturdy.  completely microwave and dishwasher safe.  the portion sizes are perfect for a toddler.  wish there was an option to get plates with no sections too."
we bought one of these items for our family years ago and our friend thought it would be good for her grandson. they love it. thank you for a great transaction.
"thank goodness for this little bear, now when my daughter wakes in the night she can easily find her pacifier. wish i'd found this a lot sooner."
this was a adorable night light.  very sturdy. we purchased this night light for our great nephew who spends the night with us quit often and he loved it.
"i got this for my 2 yr old grandson for when we go out on the boat.  he gets sleepy and there' not a good spot for him to lie down so this really works great.  it's also nice to take when he's on vacation so there's no need to find him a bed or place to sleep.  best of all, he likes it."
great book! my baby loves the sound coming out of leaves in this book. it gets nicely washed if baby drools over it or chews on it. rhymes in the book are great and you can play nice peek a boo with this book and the baby. it's easier to hold and turn. every page has different color and it's very engaging. love it!
"this outfit is totally adorable, it's soft and fits wonderfully! my 7 month old didn't have any issues with it at all, it probably felt like one of those snuggie blankets. plus she got a ton of compliments on how cute she looked, it's well worth the price."
"these are so terribly cute. i have bought every single one that is for a boy or gender neutral, so he always has one to match his outfit. hope baby likes them as well as i do!"
"best feature ... silverware is very safe for toddlers, nice rounded points on fork. cup is well balanced; easy to handle and hard to tip!"
perfect for kids. i bought the bowls and the plates and they're easy to deal with and look great too. i love them!
"i use this for occasional work pumping and nights out. i prefer this to my medela double electric and think i get more too! bought it so i could attend a wedding without having to worry about the logistics of being able to pump. the beauty of this is you can do it anywhere, i just threw a blanket over my chest and did it in the car in the parking lot!! if you pump for full time work, you will probably need the double electric, but even so i would get this in addition to for on the to. it does great."
great booster seat for my 5 year old.  i bought this seat over a year ago and it's still good as new.  my son is now 5 and still fits safe and comfortably in his booster. i'm very pleased with the purchase.  it's not too bulky and it was pretty easy to assemble.
"great carseat at a great price.  it is a tad bit wide which having twins, all but takes up my 2nd row with both these seats pushing my daughter out to the third row with hers.  the wings on the back are a bit wide which presents the problem.  but i am fine with it considering how great these are safety wise."
"love this!!. we got one for my daughter when she was born. she still loves hers, 2 years later. we knew we had to get one for our son!"
the high sides on this plate are very helpful to a toddler trying to get food onto his utensils. he likes having food in the big section and dips in the smaller. colors are good. indestructible.
so much better then pins! i've been using snappi's for almost 3 years and have only had 2 break out of the probably 10 we've had. we probably lose more then we break. that's why i got the neon ones!
"the dog gate works great for me, i have a little mop for a puppy with hardwood floors, so he sides around alot when playing, the gate is a life saver, so he don't fall down the stairs"
for the price can't beat it !!!! drives smooth even on grass.  there could be more room in the back seat though!!!! this is the only double so far that has fit in our trunk!  if you have two infants or like us a 2 1/2 year old and 8 month old it works.  sure i would have loved to keep the big 12 position metropolitan but we could not get it in the car!!!! we got this one for $108 can't beat that with a stick!
i love this canvas-style print and the ability to take this with our family when we move instead of leaving the marks behind.  very pretty colors.
my nephew loves butterfly so i thought that buying this one will be fun. nice toy and a lot of activities
i started making homemade food for my little home.this is great for food that has been cook and needs to be mashed or fresh foods like bananas and avocados. easy to wash and sturdy.
"very nice quality; very soft.  these are more expensive than other pads, but i found them to be worth the moeny and purchased extras for the nursery and my diaperbag."
soft and sweet! the perfect little hooded bath towel. i only wish they had matching washcloths! that's the only thing that needs improvement!
"i can't say enough about this! i was reluctant to buy not thinking it would be of any interest to my 2mo old, but let me tell you! the best investment ive made (other than diapers and the such) she absolutely loves it. i can attach it to anything! i didn't think id be able to. im buying one for my soon to be nephew :) buy it! you wont regret it!"
"i recently bought these all excited to make my own organic baby food with vegetables (i was annoyed at the price and content at the store - i mean, common, babies will not only eat mostly fruit). my lo just turned one and has loved being able to feed herself with the baby food packs - so independent already!<br /><br />because of the overall good reviews and the good price, i choose to buy the precious tummies to start making my own. overall this is a great product. the zip-lock top is amazingly secure (almost too secure, very difficult to open - but that means absolutely no spills or messes). they fit up to 6 oz of food, which is more than i need at this time, but will be great as she grows older for snacks. filling them is a bit tricky, but i can imagine all similar products have this problem. several other reviews have recommended getting a food funnel, which i have not yet done but sounds like a good idea. i have managed mostly well with using a baby spoon to fill the pouches though. lastly, i really like that they are machine washable and come out pretty clean - twice i have had to just rinse one out afterwards because a little was stuck in a crease.<br /><br />initially i did have a problem with a few of the pouches, with the ziplock portion detaching from the top portion. i contacted the company and immediately they shipped out replacements. i found their customer service to be amazing, and although there was an initial hitch in some of my product, overall they work great, easy to use, easy to clean, and most important my daughter likes them!"
"this bather has been in use for over a year now at my house. it keeps my baby safely out of the water when i need her to be, and fits nicely in my bathtub. i can hang it on my shower curtain to dry and for storage. to me it feels like the baby is more secure in this bather than a conventional baby tub that you fill with water. it is also convenient that you don't have to fill and drain this bather.  i would recommend this!"
"i love the one piece design (much better then the original two part one) and the size is perfect for me.  because this is designed a bit differently then the original too, i feel like i worry about the milk getting in the tubes less.  you will still get moisture build up, but that's expected and i just let it blow off after every pump.  i really love this item."
this bottle newborn feeding set is the best! my daughter loves all dr.browns bottles! the bottle reduces the air intake in the child's mouth and prevents colic!
"my daughter loves this toy, when she starts to get bored of it i just spin it around and she is amazed again.  this thing is by far her favorite.  so much going on, on this one toy!"
"this is the stroller i have wanted for years but didn't know it existed. it is a compact stroller that can do everything i need a stroller to do. basic, simple, compact and well made. works well for a large range of ages and sizes."
i purchased this for my 5 month old son and it was the best money spent. after many days of research and review reading as a father that wants the safest and most durable products. this has lived up to it. the joy and happiness my son gets from the jumper is well worth it. as per the parents that reviewed it as having a pinch point with the elephant it can be lightly pulled up and turned away from the side and it is no longer a issue. i recommend this jumper fully.
does what it is supposed to be and soft to the touch.<br />did not pill or shrink after washed and put in the dryer.
"Love NUK pacifiers. These ones are adorable. Love the heart and elephant, and easy to pair with outfits without clashing terribly."
"My son loves these pacifiers. I tried other brands but he wouldn't use them. These are cute, functional and liked by baby. I also got the MAM leash and nipple cover for it, I love it!"
I bought this for my nephew and got a whole outfit for him on amazon because my mom is a big Orioles fan and she loved dressing him each time she had him before he outgrew it lol
MAM pacifiers are the only kind my kiddo will take!  I like these because when he inevitably spits it out at night it's still glowing - I can see it and pop it back in before he starts to fuss. I really like the sterilizer box MAM pacifiers are packaged in as well.  I usually sanitize them once a week.  Very convenient.
My son loves this. He has 3 different characters. I love this product also. It's a life saver at times when baby is cranky or hungry.
"Our twin girls love their Wubbanubs, and are a must have for nap time.  They really help keep the pacifier in their mouth so that I'm not running in and out of the room putting it back in.  I love all the cute animal options.  Would be a great baby shower gift!"
These were the only pacifiers that my daughter will use. The were a perfect fit for her and she really enjoyed them.
"My daughter will only take Avent pacifiers.  These are cute, but be warned, they come in random designs.  We got some boy colors, which we are fine with, but if you want specific boy or girl colors order something different."
"Love these soothie pacifiers. The hospital gave us one free one, and then we were hooked. My daughter does not use a pacifier all the time, but when she does she prefers these. These sterilize easily, and do not have small traps or pieces to get bacteria and nasties in."
These are the pacifiers you get at the hospital.  I love these pacifiers.  I purchase them for all my friends who are having kids and they love them. Ive used only these for my kids and they loved them.  I wouldn't use any other pacifier ever.
My daughter loves these!  I cannot have enough.  I don't leave home without them....... The quality of the stuffed animal is beautifully made & adorable.
The  perfect size. I can fit five diapers in the wet bag and I use the smaller bag for cloth wipes and spray bottle ( the smaller bag is a little small) but you can put whatever you want in it.  Very pretty colors.
Newborn loved sucking this one. She did keep other more expensive brands in her mouth. Baby was the judge of this product.
it is a high level useful device. we are most satisfied with this purchase.<br />highly recommended for newly parents or other
"we somehow lost a ring to one of our bottles.  this fit the bill and, more importantly, fit our supply of philips avent classic bottles (the 4 oz, 9 oz and 11 oz)."
this play yard works very well as a protective barrier and i highly recommend it.  we use it to guard around our fireplaces.
great quality product!  my daughter loves her wubbunub so much that we had to buy a second just in case!!
"my favorite bathtub.... i used for my 2 babies and gave to my 2 sisters and they loved it. easy and small to take anywhere. my babies were very comfortable and you can put on top of small spaces like sink, countertops, bed or anywhere that is confortable for moms back. great buy"
"medela labeled good quality bottles.  fits my medela advanced (pump in style).  great for storing milk as well in the refrigerator, have not tried freezing the bottles."
this is super cute!  and i got it for a great price.  it's for my 1.5 year old and it fits her well.  the quality is decent and i love that it covers her ears.
"i like it because it  has a contemporary look ,  you can placed it anywhere in your home and brings out a lively look."
"this booster seat is fantastic.  we are care providers for our grandchild 3 full days a week.  this seat negates the need for any highchair.  attaches very securely to a kitchen chair and can easily be removed when not needed.  the entire seat and tray are easy to clean and she can be securely positioned in the chair.  the removable entertainment tray is a great idea, keeping her busy while we prepare her meals.  having adjustable seat heights makes it useful for several years."
"i couldn't have pumped without these. i'm not well endowed at all, so i quickly realized the standard flange size was nowhere near what i needed. pumping was quite painful the first couple of weeks. the standard flange was taking in my entire aereola and deforming it. after i got these, i was much more comfortable, pumping sped up, and output increased. these were able to last an entire year of pumping.<br />however, pumping never fully emptied everything. i had to hand express the last bit of milk, to make sure output didn't decrease. it took an extra 5 minutes, but i didn't mind. i won't lie--pumping is really hard and impossible without someone to lend a hand with the kiddo since i took an hour each session with three pumpings a day. but i believed in it and wanted to do it, and i'm still glad i was able to reach my goal.<br />they're easily washed along with all the other pump parts. i used a bowl to hold soapy water, since i don't really trust the kitchen sink to be free of salmonella. and to make sure it was dry for the next pumping, i gave it a good shake to get the water out of the outer lip.<br />and as stated by ameda, the lip has a tab in it to prevent a vacuum from forming and making removal difficult. don't worry--the seal is at the base of the flange (where it begins to narrow)."
"we purchased this to use as a drying rack for baby bottles and breast milk pumping supplies, and the spacing is perfect to hold this type of stuff. wish they had a larger rack, but we just purchased a second one and it works great. easy to clean, and the included &#34;cup&#34; is great for drying small, easy to lose items."
"they were just what the mother to be was looking for. soft, colors are brighter than they appear on the website, that makes them a greater asset to the babies warmth."
"great sippy that doesn't leak.  most sippy cups leak, this one doesn't.  i like nuk and the lids are interchangeable.  plus, it's a training cup."
love these pacifiers.  they are the perfect size and my little one loves them.  we have bought 6 total (yep we loose them constantly) and don't have any complaints.  its nice to know that baby is sucking on something natural rather than plastic.
my little one has loved the site and sounds of this mobile since the first time she saw it! perfect for on the go or in her bassinet :)
this has come in handy when i need to carpool with an extra child in the middle seat between my two installed car seats. the bubble bum is probably the only booster seat that would fit in the middle of my second row (i have a lexus rx350). i decided to purchase it after reading all of the reviews and i have been very pleased.
"i did not use this personally but it saved my wife when she was pregnant. she was regularly using 4 or 5 different pillows stuffed and tucked in various positions so that she could get to sleep. i was usually the one doing the stuffing which caused more than one argument when i couldn't get the pillows just right (no fault of mine of my wife's we were just both tired and she was trying to get comfortable for two). we would also be woken up at least once a night because of a pillow falling out of place or because my wife needed a pillow adjusted. a chiropractor specializing in pregnant mothers and infants told us to try this pillow and so we did. all the other pillows were put back in their homes. my wife was able to position this pillow by her self for the most part. it stayed in place almost every night and gave her head, belly, back, and leg support. we both slept better thanks to this great pillow."
"Wonderful match for our nursery. It is sturdy, functional and so cute. I was also very pleased with the shipping packaging."
Bought these as a gift for a new mom and didn't even realize that the handles glow in the dark.<br /><br />I have a 6 month old and might just order a few of these for myself.  SO handy at night!
"I have two little girls and these were the favorite pacifiers for both.<br />The area around the mouth seems to be smaller than that on other pacifiers, which seemed to be more comfortable for them and easier for them to hold.<br />We usually give these as gifts and have had people ask us where they can find them because their babies love them."
"Every parent should own one of these, unless you enjoy the process of getting up repeatedly all night to replace your baby's pacifier. We give one to all our friends when they have a baby, and several have gone on to buy many more of their own."
My little ones favorite pacifier and the only one she would take really. She uses it as her friend now but still attached to it too.
I love giving these pacifiers as gifts. It is so cute and it's  hard lose because its attached to a stuffed animal.
"the hilarity of it is enough to make the purchase, but the look on my sister in laws face when I gave to them for my nephew was priceless."
Our dog chewed our old one so we bought a new one. Its really soft and its pretty big to help keep it in place so the baby doesn't loose it.
My baby Boy loves these.  For the NUK brand this was a very good price and I like what I got.
Got this for my nephew as an infant and it was his favorite. He would fall asleep rubbing the beany bag dog in his fingers. Seemed soothing and also helped with the pacifier not falling.
"nice that they come with covers for the nipples, cant think of too much to say about a pacifier though"
Works great for my newborn-it doesn't fall on the floor and roll all over like a regular paci!  It is alot less germy that way!
These are so great. Really well made and a perfect way to get the daddy-to-be excited about buying baby items.
Very cute paci. My baby is not born yet not until Dec. but I love this and I hope he loves it too.
"I love this! My daughter however has decided she doesn't like soothie pacifiers.  If only I'd had this for my first child, she loved this brand of paci and the animal really helps to keep the pacifer in the right place.  Now if only this company would sew other styles of pacifiers to stuffed animals, they'd have my business!!"
I have been looking for one for my Grandson.  This is a must have for infants.  He loved the bright color.
"We've tried several pacifiers, and these are the best for staying put in my daughter's mouth.  They're her favorite, too :)."
"We purchased two of these while our twin daughters were still in the NICU and we love them! They are now 4 months old and we have yet to use or purchase any other pacifiers. Easy to clean off with hot water and/or a mesh laundry bag. They are the perfect weight, not too heavy, but just enough to keep them in place. Really soft and cute in person too!"
"MY FAVORITE PACIFIERS!!<br />They say on the box all of the benefits, but the natural rubber, easy to clean, easy to sleep for the baby... and no face marks!<br />Extra safe and better for baby than all those plastic ones... love natursutten products!"
Works well with a newborn. This pacifier was recommended by my baby 411 book because it is similar to a woman's nipple. Our 3wk old had no problem going between the nipple and the pacifier and seems to enjoy it for soothing.
"We love this little tiger...our newborn does, too! He can grab it and hold it so much easier than other pacifiers! Great shipping and service.  Thank you!"
I was what I was lloking for.  Im expecting my baby and this pacifier are perfects<br />thank you ! :)
"My grand-daughter loves these!  They are so cute, durable and gives the baby something to hold on to.  Love them!"
"My son will only take NUK brand, so these were perfect.  Such a great price!  I hope to never run out again."
I love it!!!! Easy to find and hold on to!!!! I use it every day!!!i want to order another one!!!
"We have tried a bunch of pacis for our daughter but these are the only she will take. And by judging by the amount of kiddos in her daycare that use these, I'm sure they are a top seller."
My son loves these. I think the teat has an &#34;easy to hold in the mouth&#34; shape. I've compared it to other pacifiers from different brands and this seems to be the most comfortable.
"Her favorite, gives her something to play with while she soothes. Highly recommend! Happy Baby, Happy mommy.<br />Easy to clean too. Throw in washer in an intimates bag."
Love this pacifier! It is so easy for my little one to grab ahold of and put back into his mouth if it falls out.
"After reading the story about a kid who was able to swallow whole and began choking on his pacifier, I was freaked and so glad I chose these pacifiers. Base is large with not fear of choking. The little notch is great for my little guy's nose (his lil flat nose peeks out just above it but I think the round one would suffice too without obstructing any air passages). Not only are they made of natural materials (better for the environment and less likely to have toxins), they are adorable on...think Maggie Simpson ;)<br /><br />You do need to heed the manufacturer's recommendation and replace every few weeks (like you would a toothbrush) cause they kinda flatten out and become tacky. It's actually good practice to replace cause no matter how often you wash and sterilize, over time materials do wear and bacteria have more crevices to hang out longer."
"I bought the duck Wubbanub first as an intro pacifier after waiting 6 weeks to introduce pacis to avoid nipple confusion. I'd read a lot about Wubbanubs and Soothies (the pacifier brand attached to the Wubbanubs) being a great option for holding.<br /><br />LOVE Wubbanubs! Took a few days/weeks for little one to warm up to using a pacifier but she loves her Wubbanubs. I bought the tabby kitty to keep in her crib and we use the ducky for going out. The necks are easy to use a snap-on pacifier holder ( a friend had gotten us one from Etsy with a thick hairband on the end). They're super easy to grasp for little one. It was the first thing she learned to really grab well and to pull back into her mouth.<br /><br />They sit so well on her chest. I like the kitten over the ducky for this reason-  it's a bit wider so it sits really well. And I just realized I can (LOOSELY) tuck it into her swaddle so that it's easy to find again. I just did it for the first time and little one has been starting to go through a sleep regression and she just woke up, found it, and went back to sleep! Holy crap. Why didn't I try this sooner?!<br /><br />Anyways, I've tried regular pacifiers (even Soothies) since and she spits them right out. She liked to hold on to the little stuffed guys. I definitely recommend and I think I'm going to start getting them for baby shower presents, since you probably can't have too many.<br /><br />I will say, I wish I could take off the paci to boil but I wash it with hot water and soap every once in a while and throw it through the wash occasionally (especially the one we take out of the house). And I have stuck the tip into a boiling pot of water before too really quickly but watch you don't burn yourself with the steam."
my baby cant live without these pacifiers.  they give me additional hours of sleep daily because they help my baby calm down.
"When I first got it I thought it looked a lot smaller in person then in pictures and it was lighter in weight than I had thought it would be. I thought I would not like it . I gave it a try and my baby loved it . He is so attached to it , and since he holds on to the toy the paci doesn't fall out of his mouth every second. I clean mine in the washing machine. I am buying another one since it takes some time to dry. Over all happy baby =happy mommy"
"My 2 month old daughter constantly loses her pacis, the wubba has given her something to hang on to.... it's great for the trips where I can't put her paci back in for her over and over again."
"This is the only pacifier my baby could keep in her mouth. She wouldn't take any other kinds. She stopped wanting any pacifiers around 5 months, so I am happy we won't have to wean her off one."
"As the mom of two kids this wasn't around my first time as a parent, and I wish it was. Great product for little ones who have the tendency to spit their pacifiers out and then lose them. The cute doll gives a baby something to cuddle with as they soothe themselves. I highly recommend these as shower gifts, they are cute AND super useful."
Greatest pacifier I have ever found. My kiddos love them and when they out grow the pacifier I cut it off and they are able to keep their lovey for comfort.
My kiddos love their pacifiers and as they grow out of using them I cut the pacifier off the animal and they still have their little lovey to comfort them.
Great product and perfect for little guys trying to learn to reach and hold on to colorful objects! He loves it! Thanks!
"These pacifiers are great.<br />Well made, rubbery.<br />My granddaughter loves them.<br />easy to clean.<br />I just wish they glowed in the dark..not easy to find if lost..lol<br />Would buy these again"
Love these glow in the dark pacis!! They don't stay super bright all night but they are lit up just enough that you can find it in a pitch black room
"It does smell like rubber which I dislike, however it's worth it for her to have a rubber pacifier vs a plastic one filled with chemicals."
"Loved these, and baby did too. Everyone wants to know about them and where to get them... will<br />be great for Halloween, highly recommend."
"I purchased this because it was unique and my friend had put it on her list of wants for her baby shower.  She had put it on there as a funny gift, not really expecting to get it, but she was pleased."
Love this lamb! Soo cute! My daughter loves it! We also own the giraffe and elephant which are great too!! These also make perfect shower gifts I give them to all my friends! Highly recommended
And it's so much better than the &#34;first years&#34; one with the same name! Light weight and easier for my boy to keep in his mouth.
These pacifiers are great. I love there is another option for colors. I have twin girls so it is nice each one gets their own color!
Very cute . It makes my baby look like a little cute gentleman . He is going to look extra cute on my wedding with that and his tuxedo .
And it's so much better than the &#34;first years&#34; one with the same name! Light weight and easier for my boy to keep in his mouth.
Our grandson would not take any other pacifier except his &#34;Ellie&#34;!  We tried giving him the plain pacifier like it but he won't have anything to do with it.  He loves his &#34;Ellie&#34;. :-)
And it's so much better than the &#34;first years&#34; one with the same name! Light weight and easier for my boy to keep in his mouth.
We tried several different pacis and my son loves this one. I really like the paci holders you can buy separately. I also like how the box it comes in is also used to sterilize them in the microwave. I would buy again. We used these to get my son to stop sucking his fingers. It worked.
"My baby has always preferred the Nuk pacifiers over the soothies.  I feel that the &#34;contoured&#34; shape helps them keep it in their mouth better.  The bright colors and designs are cute, cute."
The handle of this box is very convenient. I can hook it on my bag or the baby's bag. Also a good pass time toy for the baby
"We probably have a dozen of these around the house and cars. They are really reasonably priced on here, and it's comforting to know that when my daughter has lost 5 of these in her crib through the night, I have another few ready on her nightstand!<br />We have this kind and the 3+ month version, our 9-month-old daughter has been using them interchangeably for sucking and gnawing with her new teeth. These are slightly more flexible, but they're holding up great, no casualties yet."
"The mustacho is a bit large for newborns. The plastic rubs against his cheeks and nose. It causes chafing. Other than that, the nipple was supple & super cute for pics"
"My baby LOVES Wubbanubs, and this monkey is adorable and we received it quickly! I am Very Happy with this purchase!"
"fit my bright starts sleepeasy perfectly. minimal gaps around the edges, i think it's as tight a fit as you can reasonably expect."
"these are very cute. bought 2 of these for my grand twins, and 1 extra. they haven't used them yet, but they seem to be a good size. year old twins, that are used to sippy cups already, but i like modern unusual things. also says that they are upper rack dishwasher safe, and 9 oz is a nice size. should be easy for their little hands to hold, and not easy to spill! they come in such cute colors! and if you get more than one color you can mix and match the caps."
"this fleece sleep sack is a great weight for the cooler months. it is very soft and luxurious feeling and i love the pink and white &#34;puppytooth&#34; pattern. it fits my average size 8 month old (she is 28in and 17lbs) with some room to grow, though i don't think it will fit at 12 months. it washes well and seems like a high quality product, worth the price!"
great buy for a high chair that fits all the basic needs for a child!! mine still in the kitchen  waiting for my 2nd baby to come! sturdy and very functional!!
"i wanted to write a review because i relied a lot on them when buying our second bouncer.  we had the rainforest jumperoo with my daughter two years ago and all the reviews on it were still so good that i almost duplicated my purchase for our five and a half month old son.  instead, we decided to try this new bouncer and are glad we did.  he likes it just as much as our daughter liked hers and i think the toys on here are actually more interactive.  it took him two weeks of sitting in it for 5-10 minute increments to realize that the chair bounced and he could actually bounce around.  he now loves it and will squeal for 20-30 minutes easily spinning around in the chair.  the hanging red monkey is his new best friend and the chew toy frog has been slobbered on a lot already.  although i agree that the base is not quite as sturdy, i'm in no way nervous that he is going anywhere.  you really cant go wrong with either one....pick which theme you like the best :)"
"we purchased this for our new baby nursery and have been very pleased.  although we realize that the infant can not use a bumper pad and the blanket, i still love how all the pieces come together.  the purples, blues, greens, and beige compliment each other and give you several color options to use in the room.  i think this would look great with any color furniture.  when i was ordering the coordinating pieces, i was confused on what material this was going to be.  it is a light corduroy as are the 2 wall hanging plaques.  those are fabric wrapped around a wood frame. overall- love the product."
bought this turtle as a gift for my nephew when he was in the hospital.  it was a great hit.  he loved it and all that came to visit liked it too.  very durable and lasts a long time.  havent heard of any issues with it.
my daughter loves her new nap mat.  she uses it daily at daycare and it has held up well in the wash.
this is by far my baby's favorite teether!  i love that the material is safe and the little nubbies desensitize his gums for when we introduce a toothbrush.  he loves that it's easy for him to hold (started using it around 4-5 months old) and he can chew on the smooth or textured parts and get relief in all areas of his mouth.  we love this teether and he uses it everyday!  :-)
great product. exactley what i wanted and recieved them early in the mail.my daughter loves this binkie and its hard to find the original product because playtex changed the product.
"i love this as a reusable bag for lunches. don't use it for anything you plan on keeping in there for more than a day- it will stale. it has yet to stain at all and is so easy to clean. i just quickly rub it with dish soap, rinse thoroughly, and let it dry overnight!"
"this stroller is wonderful. i bought it after seeing the reviews of everyone else. it works so well. my favorite feature of the stroller is that it fits my graco car seat perfectly. as others have mentioned, the car seat does stick over the back a little making it uncomfortable for my other daughter to sit down, but she would rather stand anyway so she can see out. i also like the turn radius on it. corners so easily.  the price on it also makes it completely worth it. i love everything about it."
"i have a rambunctious 17 month old that finds a way to destroy everything in my house. i had two high-end, expensive gates from a popular baby chain store that did not last one year. i replaced them with two other high-end, expensive gates of a different brand. i thought that in order to get good quality i had to pay a lot. finally, after four broken gates and a large credit card bill, i bought this gate. i paid $35 for it, received it in two days (thanks to amazon prime) and have loved it since the day i installed it! it looks great, swings effortlessly in either direction, has thus far withstood my 26lb baby boy climbing and swinging on it, and even stands up to my 65lb dog who constantly jumps up on it. we have had it for about four months loved it so much i bought a second one for my home, and one for my dad's house too. my favorite part is that it does not have a bottom bar. perfect for the doorway we put it in, which has a threshold already. and great for my dad's, as he was constantly tripping over the bar on the previous gate. so happy i found this! going to recommend this gate to everyone i know with kids and/or dogs."
we love it our new  vilac french teepee for my baby son 2.5 he love it  very very nice.thank you amazon  .good for
Worked very well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I carry her everywhere with me thanks to this extension. I have hands free now! Yay
"Was purchased for expecting parents who love mustaches and good laughs!!  Completely obsessed with mustaches, this makes a great gift!!"
"My daughter loves this (when she's in the mood for a pacifier, that is). The dragon is adorable, and helps keep her pacifier in place in the car when she gets fussy. There are definitely cheaper wubbanubs, but my husband and I decided that if we were going to stare at it a lot, it was worth paying extra for the special edition dragon. And now that I have it in hand, I know we made the right choice!"
It was exactly what it said it was. Nice that they specify so you don't have to worry they might be pink.
He wont take a regular passy anymore once he started using these. would highly recommend for all newborns. Bite price tho
"From what I've heard, little guy is enjoying it very much.  Gives him something to hold onto a little better, and it sure was nice as a baptism gift."
The BEST Pacifiers EVER!!! They are so nice because they are all rubber and your LO can chew on the outside while teething.  If you liked the Gumdrop when they were born - you will LOVE these! They have a nice curve for the nose and it is easy for your LO to hold onto with the gripper on the outside.  Would not use any other!
I Love these bottles i have them for about a month or so now its so easy to just put in the microwave to sterilize my baby is fully breastfed and he have no problems going from the breast to these bottles .I thought they might leak because of the holes in the bottom but they don't leak and the nipple do not get sucked in when my baby use them
"This is actually a &#34;backup giraffe&#34;.  We got the first one at a baby shower, and our infant loves his wubbanub so much that we wanted to have a second one in case of loss.  Before we got the second one, we recently had a panicked search through the grocery store for the dropped giraffe.  He loves it so so much.  Our friends have commented how the giraffe is in all of our photos of our son.  Well worth the price."
"Adorable stripes, fits two pacifiers inside, the little handle lets you attach it to other things, great pattern, would buy again."
"My 12 week old loves this product. She snuggles the little lamb with one arm while sucking the pacifier. The weight of the animal seems to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth which is extremely helpful. I will be purchasing more, however I do wish you could switch out the pacifier. I'm sure this is a safety feature though."
My grandson has so many of these he loves his little stuffed animals with the pacifiers. I think he has just about everyone that has been made.

Love these bottles. Great price.
This is so cute.  What a great idea.  Used it as a decoration on a diaper cake.  Expectant mom loved it
"Who would have thought to attach a soothie pacifier to a stuffed animal!! Found these once at a local retail store and could not locate them again, anywhere. So glad we found on here. Great Product!"
perfect way to get my grandson going in baseball he will become a true dodger fan with his grandma. goes perfect with the dodger pacifer clip
These are the same pacifiers that our hospital was offering. Our baby girl uses them to fall asleep sometimes and she loves them. They were the perfect size for a newborn.
"As with most babies that take a paci, It falls out and they cannot put it back in. This solves that problem. I would lay the baby to sleep on their back, put this on their stomach with the soother in their mouth, as they fell asleep, a lot of times, they spit it out, but when they would wake, they would root around and find it again!"
it was just too cute my granddaughter loved it i would buy more and tell my friends about them love it
These are the greatest pacifiers we have been using them for a while. My son is 2 and had a tendency to chew through the other all natural rubber pacifiers and would pop them. But he can't with the ecopiggies because of the hole in the back. They are a little thicker too so I  think they last longer and don't get sticky either
"This pacifier was the perfect paci for my breastfed baby.  She longer will take it, but when it was needed, it did it's job.  I always buy from Amazon, but I like that in a pinch I could pick these up at a local Whole Foods."
These work great! I bought the neutral print and the little boy print and both are very cute! They don't leak and the small pouch is definetly just for pacifiers or something tiny... worth the money though!
My son has the frog one and we bought this one so we have an extra! Plus we are Detroit Tigers fans! So when I found out they made a tiger one I had to get it because it's a very rare find. He absolutely loves these. They're so easy to clean. Wubbanubs are a great investment if your child likes the soothies pacifiers.
My daughter LOVES these pacifiers.  She will not touch any other pacifier I have offered her.  These are also the same pacifiers that I received from our closest children's hospital!  Highly recommend them!
"Item as described, received on time, in good condition. Will buy again from this seller.<br /><br />I just wish the pacifier was removable. My daughter likes a different brand, but I wanted the doll, so I cut the one it came with off and sewed her favorite brand on. Works great!"
"We got our first WubbaNub as a shower gift. We didn't use immediately but after several awaken nights of our baby searching for the pacifier that rolled out of the crib, we brought it out. The animals are the perfect weight/size to help keep that pacifier from rolling around in the dark and easy for them to grab. It didn't take long before our baby was self-soothing and we never left the bed. It is now an item our toddler will not go to bed without. We have 2 - the giraffe and monkey. I must say, the monkey is probable the cuter of the two."
"She had latched onto to these pacifiers quite well, however, not latched as in &#34;I need my paci&#34;. Once she's had her comfort, she spits it right out, which is a plus!"
The 4 pack was a good buy. Our baby tends to loose the pacifiers often. So it was nice to get 4 at a time!
We have several Wubbas at our house and they're a huge hit with our 5 month old. He can play with it and grab it all on his own. It also works great for soothing him.
"My 3 month old LOVES this thing. He has to have it with him all the time. It's very easy to clean, very tough."
"Cute, durable, washable, and fits easily into little hands. Also, very difficult to lose! I get a lot of compliments on these and own 3 total."
these seem to be the favorite shape for my baby. She is 3.5 months and has begun teething very early. She seems to still like these the best because they can be chewed a bit and seem to bring her some extra comfort. Sometimes I even chew on the rim myself and get a bit of satisfaction out of it :)
Awesome product. My child loves it! One thing wish the pacifier could easily be removed from the stuffed animal for cleaning.
"great size and wonderful absorbancy. so much better than many of the fashion, burp cloths that look cute but don't soak much up."
"these wipes work really well.  i use them for cleaning my son's bum at diaper changes, and even with messy poops i almost always just need one.  they wash well, maybe shrink a small amount so the edges aren't perfectly even anymore, but i&#34;m using them for his bum so i don't care.  same with the colors - i got exactly what's pictured, but it really makes no difference to me."
"these are so cute and great for many things. if its tie backs, or gifts wrapping. i would buy this again"
"i waited a month before writing this, to be sure of my feelings. we bought this gate for my new german shepherd puppy. after a month, i have to say, for the price, i love this gate! as long as you measure your door openening, this gate will keep your dog, or baby where you want them. sturdy, and light, they have stood up to this puppy as he has grown. and german shepherd's grow quickly! no worries, this is well with the money!"
"captain calamari is just too cute!  i love the name of this little guy, and how colorful he is!  perfect for the little grandson's nautical themed nursery!"
fit in small escort perfectly! nice and snug. defiantly extra protective of your child . tall sides are great!! buy this car seat! you won't be disapointed!
love them easy fit to the nuk bottle and great step to change from newborn nibbles to spout and not hard to change and thank you so much.
me and my boyfriend love the quality shipping was really fast it was easy to put together and it was purchased at an extremely good deal!!
we were very happy with this little coverlet. it is just the color and design we were searching for. it seems to be well made and we like it very much.
"all the parts work perfectly with my medela pump-in-style.  the one piece shield/connector is even better than the 2 piece medela: one less part to clean, and better suction!"
my grandson absolutely loves danny the duck.  it's easy for him to grasp and hold his bottle while he is cuddling with his duck.
"this walker is easy to put together, has a lot of do dads on it and baby loves it! thanks!"
"great to send with my 5 year old to kindergarten in her lunch to school, and to use at home...our 2 year old loves to be like her big sister and these are great to help her have that plus her growing independence.  great find!"
the projection is amazing... my wife and i find ourselves staring at the projection more than our daughter! it's fun and practical with classic tunes...
"arrived quickly, perfect condition, and perfect fit. great for strollers, car seats, etc. especially for cloth diaper wearing little ones"
he loves to cuddle with it and is proud to carry it with him.<br />we switch it tot he front then he pretends he  is carrying a real dog.
"we were looking for something to cover the catwalk at the top of our staircase/hallway, but we wanted something that wasn't an eye sore!  and, this was it.  it was very easy to use/install.  my husband just measured, cut and hung it up with zip ties.  nobody can even see it!  we also made a cover for the fireplace, which we used with some strong velcro-like stuff we got at the drug store.  and, we did the same with our glass shelved entertainment center to keep our little guy out of the electronics.  he still likes to get up there and bang on the plastic, but it's harmless.  this product is awesome and i've recommended it to a couple other people i know who are in the baby proofing stage."
it was a great buy i m so happy and the quality is better than i expected and i recommend it.
bought these for my grandaughter and fits perfect. this is a wonderful quality product.<br />fast shipper<br />  great soft cotton we love hello kitty!!!!
"my 18 month baby only wants to go to sleep with this avent pacifier , its easy to wash ."
easy clean up and easy to clean under it. i love the harness it keep my daughter in the chair and i know she is safely strapped in because she can be an escape artist.
love the Moustache on an eight month old. Received a good number of facebook likes on the photo. might grow a moustache myself so that we match
Fun!  as good as it looks in the picture.  goes great with a wide assortment of headgear . worth buying it.
Convenient it closes before it touches any surface.<br />Price is great for the quality.<br />I believe is a must have.
These are awesome pacifiers - just like the ones at the hospital. You get a pink and a purple one. Highly recommend.
the bronco pacifiers were perfect! my daughter truly loves them! they were a great price and I couldn't have asked for a better product!
"I love Wubbanubs! I bought this for my 2 month old son because I also love dragons and he likes the Soothie pacifiers.<br />He hasn't mastered the art of finding it and putting back in his mouth yet, but he does like to hold on to the body if the dragon while he's sucking on the paci.<br />I searched EVERYWHERE for the dragon Wubbanub and found it only on amazon. It's pricy for a paci, but we both love it and my son will get tons more use of it!"
This is the second one I am buying just so we have an extra around the house! My daughter not only loves the pacifier attatched to it but she likes to hold the animal attatched... it provides extra comfort! They are totally worth the buy! & if the animal gets dirty you can just throw it in the washing machine and it comes out clean and even softer! I can't say enough great things about this product! Just for safety do not let your baby fall asleep with it in the crib and unwatched because it's not safe to have stuffed animals by your babies face... it's best if they are in a chair/swing/bouncy/car seat using it! but seriously a incredible product!
I love these New York Yankees pacifiers. They will be perfect for my newborn grandson. My daughter loves them. Thank you.
My baby seems to love this one better than others. Maybe because of its orthodontic nipple design. It also stays in his mouth longer his other pacifiers. He gets many compliments for his &#34;mustache.&#34;
My son is 8 weeks and this is the best idea I have seen.  He is breastfed so sucking on a paci isn't easy for him.
Always have loved these pacis. Same ones as the little babe gets at the hospital so there isn't any confusion for them!
Love avents pacis. Cute farm characters on paci. Son loves them. There isn't a huge difference in the 0-6 and 6-18 month size so not a huge transition. My son wouldn't take anything but wubba nub soothies before this. So glad found something that he LOVES.
I love these pacifiers! It made it easy to find them art night. I would recommend leaving them near a light source for awhile before they will glow longer and brighter.
"My 9 month old sleeps with one Wubbanub in her mouth, and one in each hand. I keep a stash of them in my car so I can easily pop a new one back over to her when she chucks it out of her carseat. The monkey is my favorite because it's dark colored - makes it easy for her to see it on her white bed sheet in the middle of the night so she can pop it back in."
"You know how normal binkies have a top/bottom, and you have to insert it a certain way or it won't be comfortable? Well, these don't have that! They are contoured for babies mouth, unlike newborn pacifiers, but they have no top or bottom. Yay! Also, they come with protective covers for stowing pacifiers in a diaper bag or purse."
Exactly what I was looking for with the waterproof! & exactly what I was expecting from this product! Thanks so much.
"Firstly, This Pacifier has a round end on it. So if your baby is not used to this type of pacifier, they might Not like this one.  It is Permanently attached to the stuffed animal, it does not detach for cleaning!  The stuffed animal is lightweight, stuffed with cotton. I like the Wubbanub because it is Easy to Find, no more going crazy trying to find the small pacifier!  Even very young infants can grasp at the animal pacifier, it is amazing to watch them, holding onto the  Wubbanub, thusly holding onto the pacifier!  Somehow it keeps the pacifier in babys mouth, especially while baby is lying down.  At night it is invaluable for a parents good nights sleep; if your baby loves the pacifier!  I've found the perfect way to keep the pacifier clean, just buy the pacifier wipes and use them to keep it clean and sanitized. This Giraffe is Loved so much that one  stays home and  one is even kept in the diaper bag, heaven forbid we loose one!  I really like the Giraffe because it is so easy for little hands to hold onto so many of the little legs. This Wubbanub should be looked over occasionally, just to make sure there are no holes or stuffing coming out, this is Not a Teething Toy!, remember it is, just a pacifier with an attached stuffed animal!<br />."
"My daughter is 3 months and she loves this! It stays in her mouth much better than just the soothie by itself! You can tuck it under their blanker to keep it in as well. When they turn their head, its less likely to fall out. And its super cute so she cuddles with it!"
looks as picture stuffed little pillows with a musical box that plays twinkle twinkle little star a very nice musical mobile.
"this product is just what i was looking for.  i only wish it had holes or grippers for the shopping cart. other than that, it's perfect."
"wow, is this a nice set!  it comes with everything you need to decorate the babies room. i love it!!"
"love it, works as a hamper or for toys and a lot bigger than expected, this is well worth purchasing!!!!"
"charm me my product with expectations fulfilled, what was expected recommend it 100% all was very fast and safe, great seller"
"this is a very nice bassinet skirt. i was going to sew my own for my daughter but when i saw this, i decided to give it a try.  i'm very impressed. after a little pressing, it looks beautiful!"
"we travel with our toddler quite a bit and this is an excellent, easy to carry, cot for any sleeping arrangement! so much easier than taking a crib mattress! make sure that your toddler can get up and down from things, i had her sleeping in this at about 2-years old. i think before that age they are still unsteady and may fall out of the cot. it is low to the ground and with a bottom blanket for extra padding is a life saver in hotels, grandma's house, and when you have guests. great buy!"
really liked this accessory for the pac n play. made it nice for the baby to lay on. like it
"very cute! just the ticket for young back-to-schoolers, or those just starting out. the matched set of the backpack and the lunchie are adorable. gender neutral dog, appeals to both boys and girls. very nice quality and design."
"very easy to put together and a great bookcase for the price! would not recommend in a children's room, unless you bolt it to the wall.  unit is very heavy!"
"got this as a gift for a 6 month old niece who's teething. she loves it and would put it in her mouth all the time. great deal, bought it based on rave reviews on amazon."
this was easy to assemble and install on the bed.  also stores well for later use.  liked that it has mesh to make it less claustrophobic.  grandson has no objection to using it for his sleepovers.  he doesn't flip is down and instead exits the bed from the end.  he rolls around a lot and it kept him safe.
"i absolutely love this blanket for my son.  it is super soft and it's great for cool mornings, nap time, or to lie on for play time."
"brush bottle cleaners are far better than sponge.  bought both, and will never buy sponge again.  this is perfect because it stands on its own, dries so it does not stink, and is just long enough for baby bottles.  however, the utility value and target market would be much greater if they added 3&#34; -4&#34; of length to it so it can also clean sports bottles and canteens.  too short for this application."
"i love these cups. they stay clean, don't absorb odors, and keep the temperature of the liquid inside for hours. perfect for hot summers and cold winters, like we have in cleveland."
we bought this for our parents vehicle and it is so easy to install and use with our existing infant car seat.
i got this when my baby was 4month old..its her favorite chew toy! i give to her and she just chews every where! ring part and leafy part! with her wabbly and not stable grabbing technic this is such a perfect toy for her! thank you for all the amazon reviewrs who highly recommand this! it stops her fussyness and thats so much more than i asked for! great product just amazed what little toy can do!
i bought this to carry around frozen breastmilk and bottles for my son. it was perfect! not too big not to small. a lot of people are confused about the size it's l9\\xw6\\xd4.5<br />it's made of heavy fabric and nothing is broken for me. it has a heavy lining inside for bags to stay frozen when traveling. i went on a plane with frozen breastmilk this this bag from freezer to freezer it was about 5 hours and my milk stayed frozen! very happy with this purchase would recommend it to others!
My granddaughter loves this baby but it was a little smaller than what she had hoped for.  We kept it because we thought of it as a premature baby.  It is still loved and played with.
"i bought the lion and the bull and our grandson loves them. they are his favorite. great idea, very well made..perfect"
My daughter won't sleep without something to hold on to and without a pacifier and this combines it perfectly for her
I love this. I have seen other babies with these and could not wait to get one for my grand princess.  She will be her Nov so we will see how she likes it.
"Great little pacifier purse.  Keep your pacifier from becoming dirty or lost with this brightly colored, pleasing patterned pacifier purse.  Love the fact that you'll find it in a deep dark bag due to the colorful stripes.  Works great!"
"These are great.  My twin girls love them, and they are easy for me to find in the middle of the night.  Hopefully they'll be able to find the pacis themselves in the middle of the night sometime soon!"
"I wish I knew about these with my first child! These are great!! No more pacifiers falling under tables or the couch. My son can find it, grab it and put it in his mouth all on his own. Also more of a comfort than just a regular pacifier since he can hold it. Love all the animal options. We have 2!"
this is just what i wanted. the design and construction were what i would of expected and  i was pleased they were.
"my god son will not use another paci! He loves it and to boot it has been almost a year my dogs ripped the pacifier part so we cut it off and My god Son still snuggles with the Plush toy, Thank you for such a good purchase! i bought 3 more :)"
Love these bottles and pacifiers! My baby is breast fed and took to these bottles perfectly. She doesn't seem to get much air when feeding and I love the designs. Pacifiers are the same as bottle nipples so transition between the two are not really noticeable for baby. Great set!
I have ordered these pacifiers before and they have always delivered them very fast. I just ordered more a few days ago and I just recieved them and they sent me the color i wanted and needed after I emailed them. I am extremely happy.

This is a great product for our baby who is instantly calmed when she has her WubbaNub.  It's perfect for her little hands!  She got one as a gift and we had to get a second one for her.  We've also bought two more as gifts!
I wish I would have though of this!! So much easier to find a pacifier when the baby drops it! Especially in the middle of the night! Not to mention how cute they are.
"Anything that will sooth a newborn and help her feel comfortable is great in my book. These were the second type of pacifiers we tried with our newborn, and she preferred them.  It was a great tool when my husband was trying to calm her and she wanted to suck. Or when I had breastfeed her and she still wanted to suck, but I needed a break. She almost 3 months old and still prefers this pacifier, but it seems much less so.  I highly recommend!"
Cute addition to the many &#34;binkies&#34; already being used.  It was Hello Kitty so I just couldn't resist getting it.
"I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />We love all 3 of these cute animals! The giraffe has cute sewn bubbles in different colors on her, the kitten is nice bright hot pink, and the safari puppy has a cute leopard print underside & knotted tail.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animals for girls ~ all made of pink!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning"

"Unlike the traditional pacifiers these are always easy to find, they won't roll away. Soft and Adorable!  I would highly recommend these."
"this is the perfect pacifier holder ever designed, I was recommend them for any parent of a newborn to buy and use them. cute too"
"The  Chomp  baby pacifier is hilarious! I sent it  to my daughter for my new grandbaby.<br /> She isn't here yet,but when she's old enough for it,  I'm sure gonna want pics!"
"I needed a wet bag for home so that I wouldn't have to run up stairs with a soiled flip insert in hand. This works great for what I need it to do, so far no complaints.  Not sure if I would trust this in a baby bag, because it is very thin, but I am happy that it suits my needs."
"My 3 week old granddaughter loves the soothie pacifier & holding the soft giraffe for comfort, so adorable to see!"
"Another one I ordered for my granddaughter.Easy for her to hold and she calls it her binky boo.Even tho she is 15 months old,she still wants this kind of pacifier."
super addition to my stroller. my keys & cell fit perfect in the center pocket! it's well made and easy to install.
"i bought this for college, not for a nursery and it is great. the drawers are perfect for small things, and the shelves are sturdy enough to not have to worry about them bending. arrived in fine packaging and wasn't late. overall very nice!"
my 3 grandsons love this lunch box. i highly recommmend it. they have a lot of fun with it also.
i sent this to my brand new great grandson.  i am an elephant collector and enjoyed the novelty of finding a special one to share with him.
"this booster seat is absolutely fantastic!  it's portable and very durable.  we've been using it since my grandson was old enough to sit up in it and a year later, he's still using it.  love it!"
cheap price but really protect the nice leather seats in our honda pilot. pretty inexpensive for two. my kids can't seem to keep their feet off the seats no matter how many times you tell them. this was an easy solution to keeping the seats looking new.
"i love this car seat, and so does my little one. it is easy to use, you can easily put in it your car or take it out. it is also light weighted so its not a problem to transfer it from car to car.<br />the only two things that were not perfect: the product description says you can use this seat from 22 pounds on. we started using it when my little one had around 22, maybe a bit more. but as she is not the tallest, she barely could see over the protection shield, not speaking of holding a bottle or maybe a snack box. when we went for a trip, one of the adults always had to drive in the back seat to give her drinks or snacks. so this was a little disadvantage. but if you are aware of this fact (as i were not when buying) you can take it into consideration.<br />the second thing is that -if i remember correctly- you cannot remove the fabric. so if your little ones spill their drinks, there is no way to wash the fabric and you may have stains in the fabric.<br />otherwise than these minor issues, i am absolutely happy with this product."
"we originally purchased the inglesina fast chair but i was frustrated with the fact that it had no tray and there was a gap between the chair and table. after having multiple gel mats flung to the floor and food shoved into the gap and onto the floor i purchased the lobster chair. i have used it for three days (we use it in lieu of a stand alone high chair) and am satisfied with how easily it attached and the tray. no more dents in my table from slammed bottles and no more flying mats. hooray! several people complained how easily the tray slides out. i have not found this to be a problem. in the future if little one decides shoving it forward is fun i will slip a piece of non-slip matting under the tray. the bucket seat is a little deep in order to accompany kids of all sizes. my little one is on the small size so i folded a towel and put it in the seat to boost him up a bit. eventually i will not need the towel. over all i am satisfied with this chair. it packs up compactly, is easier and less bulky than the inglesina, has a tray and sits little one closer to the table. win, win."
this costume was chosen because it didnot have feet in it...so child could not fall over the shoe covers.  cute costume.
"this pumping bra is the best. very comfortable, fits well, and very adjustable for a perfect fit. makes pumping a lot easier!"
"my kindergartners love this umbrella.  it's the right size so they don't take up the entire sidewalk or poke anyone.  we've haven't had any pinched fingers or problems with the quality.  it's nice that they can see through it.  i thought it might be too much of a baby theme because it's been years since they were interested in eric carle books, but they like it."
"these pouches are surprisingly easy to clean. the seal is tight and my toddler has yet discovered how to open them - i doubt he could if he tried. this is a great, mess-free way to get little babies/toddlers to eat food that you otherwise wouldn't let them eat on their own without making a mess (i.e yogurt, applesauce, pures). my son takes it to preschool and it always comes back empty. love it!"
Got this for a baby shower gift.  Very soft.  I washed it upon arrival and it did well in the laundry.
My grandson received a set of these when he was born. His parents and I loved them. They do help prevent colic and are very easy to clean and sterilize. I bought a set for use at my house when he is here. I wish I had them when my son was small.
Exactly what we needed and even better that it came in pink and purple for my baby girl!  I could only find all pink or all purple in stores and they were for 3+ months. I got what I needed here. :)
"These are the only type of pacifiers my daughter would take. I love that they glow in the dark, great for when they fall out at night! Unless you put them right under a light, they glow but not too bright. I put one under a light for awhile and my daughter couldn't sleep because it was glowing to bright."
I have bought others for my newborn and 2 other friends with newborns so far. You cannot go wrong with this .. Babies love it!
"I have a bunch of these and use both sizes them to carry all sort of things (bathing suits, all sunblock prodcuts so the rest of the bag doesn't get all greasy, any item I want to protect from the sand, eg. camera, cel phone, etc., tampons, makeup.)  They are light, very water resistant, machine washable, extremely cute and the price is incredibly attractive to say the very least.<br /><br />I Super recommend"
this Is a great product I definitely recommend it. I absolutely loved it exactly how I expected it to be.
Only ones my daughter wants.  I have tried others but these are the ones that soothe her.  For me I would highly recommend them.<br />They worked for me!
My baby is very picky with pacifiers. If you buy these in the store for a 2pack its about five dollars. Its worth it to a big pack and if you lose one then you know you have more!
These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take and she loves the glittery ones! great pacifiers but would love it if they came in bigger packs!
"As described, fast shipping, high quality."
"Colors are just as pictured, my daughter likes them & they fit her mouth better than other brands we have tried. A great pacifier for a toddler."
"ordered this for my new grandbaby due in dec 2013.  it is so soft and cuddly, he/she is going to love it"
"We have 5 other Wubbanub animals, but this is by far my 6-month old's favorite. He LOVES his longhorn. I love that it is both a pacifier and a lovey, at the same time. My son is soothed just by holding the longhorn's little horns or his paws. It's adorable.<br />I just wash it every day or two by throwing it in the washer and letting it air dry. I quickly bought a second one so that there's always a spare when one is getting washed!"
These pacifiers are adorable and the perfect size. The shape fits perfectly around his little nose. My new Nephew loves his already.
So funny!! My nephew loves it and so do his parents!!! Thank you so much for sharing some great laughs!
This is the same pacifier we got at the hospital and it is the only one(brand) my new born likes(I've tried different brands)we only had one so we decided to order this package and we are glad we did!
It is a nice pacifier because even though she is not quite two months yet she can push it back in her mouth if it starts to fall out and she brings her hand to her mouth. the shape of it and because it is all the same material as the nipple part makes it easier to keep it in her mouth.
"came quickly as expected, quality as expected also! so very cute and the mustache reminds me of the little ones great grandpa"
"In my 'quest' for apacifier my son wouldn't spit out - I bought nearly every brand on the market.<br /><br />I bought this one as a joke.<br /><br />Turned out he liked this one the best, and as a bonus, we got compliments on how clever it was whenever we were out and about."
Part of an outstanding pirate themed diaper cake i made it is so cute and once the little guy arrives we shall see how he likes it but as a mom and a gift giver to a mom to be i loved it!!
"product is of good quality, and washes up nice, and very soft. would reccomend this product to anyone wanting good quality crib sheets. very pleased with the whole experiance."
pro-very easy to clean (just unsnap the four top parts) and toss in washer<br /><br />the mirror is kind of blurry.
my wife and i love this bath sling. it allows us to have our baby in the water in a comfortable and safe manner. the mesh of the sling allows the baby to be wet from the water while keeping her in a stationary safe and comfortable position. the folding feature allows us to store it under the sink when not in use. we will have one of these as long as we have a child that will fit it.
"my two kids have loved these bottles.  my poor son was the tester of many bottles before we found that these were the best.  we trialed about 3 other bottles before learning that the naturalatch was the best match for us. as a stay at home mom, i didn't use many bottles for my kids.  occasionally, i needed one for a feeding, but they were definitely both more willing to nurse from mama.  i found a site that recommended using these as a good match for a breastfed baby.  i would definitely agree.  gave these a try and have never gone back.  my 11 month old daughter has used these and the transition from breast to bottle was very easy for us both.  this was true for my son when i weaned him from breastfeeding at about 13 months of age.<br />i have enjoyed their durability and will admit that i haven't even used the clear plastic ones with the bottle.  they have always used the latex."
"some people have complained that the crib came with scratches - ours looked great! haven't used it yet so i will come back to edit when the time comes. a couple of pointers that other people may find useful:<br /><br />1) doesn't rock with the wheels on. the wheels just pop in and out pretty easily with a good tug, so it's not terrible, but either you're mobile or rocking.<br /><br />2)the mattress height is adjustable but you do have to use the little allen wrench they give you. pretty straightforward but not a click in/out thing like some cribs<br /><br />3)something to consider -- go ahead and order a new mattress when you order the crib. the one inch foam pad that came wiht it will be our  dog's new bed :) but keep in mind the taller the mattress, the &#34;shorter&#34; the crib rails get. i got a 3&#34; rather than 5&#34; deep mattress for that reason."
"this seat attachment is great!  we bought it as an addition to a double stroller we recently bought for our twin girls.  it is super easy to install and remove, and small enough to toss into the back of the car without taking up tons of space."
Go to the dreambaby website to make sure you purchase the correct sizes.  These are sturdy and go perfect with the gates.
"Great newborn pacifier that worked well for our son when he was one month old (he was three weeks early). Up to that point we had used the Gum Drop or Soothies, which calmed him, but I had to sit in the back seat of the car and hold them in his mouth. These pacifiers were the answer to that! The size was perfect and he could keep them in his mouth easily. I was also happily surprised that the pattern was much cuter than the picture and the color was a neutral tan. We have since bought them in other sizes and will continue to use these as long as our son has a pacifier."
"My son loved the initial wubbanub I got for him, the green frog.  I bought three, the dragon, the lion, and the dino.  He loves the myriad of colors.  Very pleased.  It also helps him grasp the object, manipulate the pacifier and aid in transferring from one hand to another, he is 4.5 months."

"I love the vanilla scent. It`s the only soother our son will use. The Avent Soothie is similar, but this one has a cut-out area around the nose, so you don`t have to worry about it possibly blocking your baby`s nostrils.  It`s easy to clean, unlike some pacifiers that will get moisture in them if you aren`t careful when cleaning."
My son loves his wub and it really helps him keep ahold of his pacifier.  The dino is cute and super soft.  Works well to prevent the pacifier from falling and landing on the floor while he hangs out in his swing.  It is also easier to find in the middle of the night than a detached pacifier.
"I tried about 30 pacifiers (yes, really) on my newborn and this nipple type shape was the only shape she liked but the problem I was having with so many pacifiers was that the rim was too big and they would wedge up against her little nose. This one gave her nose enough clearance so that she could comfortably use it. It was also nice that it had a little tab on the back with a hole in it so that I could attach a clip cord to it to keep it from falling on the ground."
"I love this product, it's fun and it came in a really nice original package. I highly recommended it. xoxo"
"works great, love the bright colors and love the split ring on top so it is easy to hook onto a purse or diaper bag!"
I LOVE these pacifiers and are the only ones my son will take! Exactly the same as the hospital gives! Cute colors. Expected by delivery date! Definitely happy with the service.
They are very cute and were well liked by the new parents. Very cute as a shower gift bag decoration.
Love love love love.... Perfect condition. No complaints. Fast prime shipping. This is for 3 months and older. BPA FREE.. I cannot wait to give these as a gift. Gooooo BROWNS
These are the best pacifiers by far for new born/ infants... It makes it easier to hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth and for them to find it in the middle of the night. The little animals give them something to hold onto...  We bought at least 10 of these on Amazon for our daughter and as gifts...  A+++++ product...

"At first glance you may think these pacifiers look a little goofy, but they're great protection against chapped lips.  MAM brand over any other was a lifesaver for our family.  My son is totally soothed by them."

We had such a hard time finding these in newborn size. My Granddaughter loved it and we so loved the smell.
"just what we had hoped for, speedy delivery great quality highly recommend this product washes great in front load washer easy for baby to hold and not so easily lost when tossed!!!"
"I used these for my first baby and she liked them a lot. We started using the pacifier very early (before she was a week old) because she would tend to suck on her mouth. In spite of this, there was no nipple confusion, and she was weaned off the pacifier by her 7th month. I've gotten them again for the second baby!"
I purchased these units after seeing them at our local hospital.  They are great because you don't need any probe covers and they work without having to touch the baby so no need to wake them to see how they are doing.
I so in love with this pacifier!So great!!!!!I recommended to buy! You love it . .Very easy to use !
"Our son was a 3 pound preemie and even with his little mouth, he was able to suck on this pacifier. He loved it!"
"Very happy, my baby too.Forget all the fancy ones,this ones are the best.Thank u Amazon for having them for us."
"We have purchased the alligator (which my dog decided was his chew toy), the giraffe, and the longhorn. I like the longhorn and the puppy the best. The giraffe's neck makes it a little less stable than the animals with the normal necks. We have yet to lose one of these because they're very visible, and my son loves the soft animal to grasp. Such a great invention! I make sure to have one with us at all times. The weight of the animals make them stay in place more than traditional pacifiers. They are also to clean (machine washable) and air dry very quickly. Don't hesitate to buy this-your baby will love it!"
This was requested by my granddaughter. She is acquiring all that she needs before the birth of our great grand baby. This will be helpful in the early months.
Just what I expected thanks I would def buy again and/or recommend to friends and family. My Baby loves them
My 2 month old loves the puppy wubbabub!  It helps him guide the pacifier to his mouth and sometimes I catch him petting this puppy just like we taught him to pet the family dog.  Super cute!
"I don't have a whole lot to say about these pacifiers.  The baby likes them, they work.  Sometimes the cat likes them too...that part isn't so good, but it's not the fault of the pacifier."
"I wasn't going to let my baby have pacifiers, maybe because where I'm from they're called &#34;dummies&#34;. Anyway, all that changed 3 days after she was born and was screaming non-stop. My mother-in-law sat me down and said &#34;now I know you don't want to use pacifiers but babies need to suck and if you don't want to breastfeed non-stop they'll help... plus they use them in the neo-natal unit at Stanford Hospital so how bad can they be?&#34;<br /><br />At my wit's end and in tears I begged her to get some for me. She returned with 3 kinds (not these, because they're not for newborns). My daughter liked the soft Nuk ones the best, but when she turned 6 months old they were too small for her so I took myself off to the store to find the same, but larger. They don't exist, so flexing my super scientific muscle I endeavored to pick the one that was closest. These were them. The colored bit is hard plastic to keep the shape, but that piece is completely covered in soft silicone. It took my daughter about a day to get used to them and the work wonders for calming her.<br /><br />You set so many rules for yourself as a parent, always with the best of intentions, but you have to be ready to flex and this is one I'm glad we broke. Nap times and I-hate-my-carseat-and-just-want-to-scream times are much easier with these.  We're about to wean her off them, but am so glad we found them when our other ones got too small."
"Of all the millions of baby things I got and bought for my child, this Wubbanub was among the most-used and best-quality items that I simply couldn't live without. The stuffed animal helps anchor the pacifier in the mouth. This was particularly helpful when she got to the age where she threw everything on the floor, where it would promptly disappear with the dust bunnies under the couch.<br /><br />She held onto the giraffe every night and it comforted her while she fell asleep and she played with it during the day. It was a lifesaver.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained the pacifier doesn't detach, but this was a plus for me. If it had, I would have probably lost the pacifier or the animal and they would have never been conjoined again. The whole thing is washable or you can simply wipe down the pacifier part. I now buy a Wubbanub for every baby shower I go to."
"I saw someone with one of the Wubbanub pacifiers for their infant child.<br />So I ordered one for a friend who was having a new baby.<br />They love it, and the baby girl can hold it in her hand even though she is less than 2 months old.<br />And it's so easy to wash,,, just throw it in the washing machine."
I bought these for a baby shower monkey theme gift basket I made and it looked so cute! thanks so much
They work great and give you a few moments to yourself.  Newborns need to suck and sometimes moms need a break.  This is the perfect solution.
This is cute.  Makes a nice 'add on' gift for new baby or for a gag gift for mom and dad
"This is cuter in person than the picture shows.  I saw it a Babies R Us and it was much more vibrant than the photo online, so I ordered it from Amazon.  About the same price at both places.  It holds two pacifiers."
This is a really cute pacifier pod that fits 2 pacifiers.  It matches the Skip Hop changing pad in Metro Stripe.
My daughter loves her Wubbanub. I give this as a gift now to every new mom I know. I don't know if it's good or bad but my 19 month old will not sleep without this so we had to get a backup just in case so we are never without one! It's very soothing to her and she loves it!
My daughter loves the wubbanub so much that we bought another one just for her to have at daycare!  Her little hands can grasp the elephants ears and it really helps the paci to stay in her mouth easier!
This was one of the many pacifier we tried with my breast fed baby. Hard to leave a review bc she ended up just not wanting any pacifier. But the delivery was fast.
We have several different brands but My 3 month old baby loves these best. Soft and easy to clean .
"nothing much to say, it is what it is a pacifier... My daughter doesn't like silicone, so it does the trick"
"This was the pacifier they gave me in the hospital and I was happy to find them on Amazon. I was given some of the First Years gumdrop pacifiers as baby shower gifts - same concept as these.  Both work great, however, the Avent Soothie is softer.  I use both and like both. The price on Amazon was basically the same as I have seen in local retail stores, but got it as an add-on item with free shipping."
As soon as I put it in his mouth he grabbed into it! He's been sleeping with it all through nap time today. I thought it had a clip to change soothies out but it doesn't. O well still so sweet and works well.:)
I love these pacifiers for the first few months. They are like the ones from the hospital and are super easy to clean. Very happy they come in girly colors too!
"Fun for baby to hold, colorful, holds in place on our newborn's chest when our arms wear out from replacing it over and over...now we gift these to all our friends with newborns too!"
"The attached toy helps keep the pacifier in the babies mouth, it also gives something for the LO to play with or hold. To clean, stick them in the washer and then sanitize them."

About the funnies thing you've EVER seen on a little new born princess. Worth the price of the ticket just for the picture opt!!
"WOW!! WHAT A FANTASTIC IDEA TO HAVE A SOFT TEDDY WITH A PACIFER, THEY ARE THE PERFECT SIZE & COLOR. MY BABY LOVE'S THEM!"
"I CAN TELL YOU WHAT A FANTASTIC IDEA ARE THIS WABBANUB PACIFER, MY BABY LOVE'S THEM ! IT IS A GRAT GIFT!"
"My son loves is paci, and so do I. I especially like the idea of how its made. Safety comes first and with this design choking hazards are very rare. I also like that if it falls on the ground it rarely touches the nipple because of its wide outer rim! Number 1 paci you can't go wrong."
my granddaughter loves it.  makes managing her pacifier so much easier.  She can get it back in place by herself and loves playing<br />with the legs of the caterpillar.  It is even cuter than the picture.

"This pacifier its beyond cute, I bought it for a present, and they just loved it, babys look adorable with this."
"Got it for my son, its a bit big for his mouth, he was only 5 months old when we got it for him.  Still very cute when he puts it in."
"We have tried every other design of pacifier out there and our son just seems to like these the most bar none. They are designed well and just LOOK like they would be more comfortable than the others... The little ridge vent in the design does work also to reduce suction.. You just have to make sure to rinse it extra well as formula and food when they get a bit older will get in the ridge... It rinses right off with an extra second, but just calling attention to it... The stages (0-3mo,3-6mo,6-12mo) seem to be about right..."
Love them all! They are all super cute and practical! This is my new favorite gift for all if the new born babies.
i love the colors and its the only kind my daughter will take !! would buy again for other kids!
"This is a good quality pacifier, and with the mustache it is special!  There are types other than the cowboy, so you can get the look you want for your little one."
"Love these.  My daughter wanted to play with her pacifier, but at 8 weeks, didn't quite have the coordination to keep track of such a small object.  We bought her this, and she loves it.  We had to buy 2 more to keep around the house/in the car.  They're also great because it's hard to lose a stuffed animal, as opposed to just a pacifer.  Great for in the car. Recommend them to all of our friends."
It was a gift I was looking for.  Couldn't find even at Disney.  They should make many more different styles
My infant loves it!! It washes wonderfully in the washing machine :-) Well worth the money! You will not be disappointed!
Oh my is this thing cute! And best of all my grandson loves it. And everyone who saw him with it adored it too.
I like this ....well not me so much as my son.  Got this one at the Hospital and threw away all the ones I bought before he was born.  I bought this one as a spare just in case the hospital one got lost.
These are as cute as they can be.  I doubt anyone else will be giving Cardinal pacifiers at the shower.
"You need to get more than one, because it becomes such a favorite. Our grandson loves his monkey. Before he could grasp, he could still pull it into him because of the attached toy. We have twin grandchildren, boy and girl. One is not into pacifiers, and her Wabbanub was never a hit, but the other had more trouble calming, and this helped him keep his needed soother in his mouth."
I recomand this prodect to anyone it is so cute i got it for my nephew and i wasnt sure he'd like it since he only likes the chupon the hospital gave him and rejects all other but i decided to get it anyway and he loved it XD (chupon means pacifer in spanish)
Cute pacifiers. They contour (unlike some other brands) making it easy to keep in their mouth. I liked getting a bunch of sports (or a similar theme) because then I knew which pacifiers where which sizes as I was finding them around the house to transition them out.
"It was tricky finding a case to fit the Philips Soothie pacifiers. This one fits wonderfully and I really like that it's hard plastic, as it is easy to clean."
"i have a very deep, long, straight-sided fiberglass jetted bathtub which is not easy to climb out of.  i bought this handle to use as a balance point rather than something to carry my weight.  as with many similar tubs, each side has a wider, flat section and this 11.5 inch bar fits perfectly.  it is the same color as the tub and blends right in.  i do test it to be sure it is firmly attached before using it, but i am amazed at how powerful the suction is - there is no way i could remove this bar from the tub surface without releasing the two catches. it has been the perfect solution for me.<br /><br />i bought my first 11.5 inch safer grip in 2009 -  it  is still attached to my tub and cannot be pulled free.  i test it regularly, but the original suction (which is now 4 years old) still holds.  i'm so happy with it that i've ordered a couple more for tubs and tile showers at my house and at my mother's. it sticks as well to my tiled shower walls as it has to the tub. please note this review is for the 11.5 inch version only.  i was disappointed in the larger 16-17 inch size which did not adhere well to my tile."
Gave as a gift at a baby shower.  Was listed on Mom's baby registry.  Have not heard any issues from new Mom.
Only thing that matters is my grand daughter is extremely attached (literally) to her &#34;puppy&#34; and when the tattered original went missing time was of the essence. Thanks for your speedy delivery.
"It is a great idea and works perfectly. My baby takes medicine better with this pacifier. There is one thing that I do not like, the hole on the bottom of the pacifier (through which the babies suck the medicine out) is a little bit too big, it is too easy to be choked by the liquid."
He loves his wubbanub. He uses it all the time and it comes in handy at night when he is searching for it half asleep he can find it easily. Hes like his little pal. Very easy to wash just toss into the washer and dry and its perfect very well made he has beaten the crap out of it and it is still holding strong.
My son loves this product and everyone sees it and wants one too. I have a stash of them saved for baby shower gifts!
I love these glow-in-the-dark binkies for my little one...easier to find at night and I love that thety came with a carrying case.
My son loves this product and everyone sees it and wants one too. I have a stash of them saved for baby shower gifts!
"Love it,  My baby is the cutest when he uses this pacifier!!!  My baby loves it and we make him use it at every chance"
"We had two of these and our daughter loved them, so.... we got sick of finding them or cleaning them.  Hey, they're cheap, right?  So I ordered 6 sets of 2.  12.... so we'd have 14 total.  Within 3 days of all 12 arriving, being sanitized and ready for use, she stopped using a pacifier.  Argh... or... YAY?  Frustrating I bought, opened, and used them all immediately.  Awesome that theres no weening her off a pacifier.  All in all, I consider it a win!"
"OK.. everything is all right. All perfect, product is the same of the sale. Very beatiful and cool. I Recomend"

"My daughter is in love with her pacifier and these are the only ones she'll take. We found them while on holiday to the US and bought what we thought was a good stock of them but now we're down to only 2!<br /> My problem with my order is that the size wasn't specified when I ordered and I was sent 0-6month pacifiers when I actually wanted the bigger type so she won't take these ones. So for me, it was a  waste of money sadly (lots of money because it was an international order and the shipping was expensive)<br />Not the fault of the seller, I must add."
"This is an excellent product. It may look a little expensive for a thermometer, but it's a good price if you consider the peace of mind the can bring to your life, especially at night when you have a sick infant or toddler having fever episodes due to a virus or other reason. When after struggling to give them some medicine and help to go to sleep, They finally feel better and go to sleep, the last thing you want to do is to wake them up by trying to check on theirs temperature. When my 1 year old daughter was sick with flu like symptons, including fever, it was a big relief for me and my wife knowing that we could just get close to her and check her temperature without touching her body; that made a world of a difference. We compared this thermometer we many others we have and find it to be as accurate as any good conventional thermometer could be. Thank you AJ WHOSALE for this wonderful product.                                         ***Feb 25, 2016.-- Still Wonderfull after about 3 years of use. Working p erfectly. Thanks one more time for this device. It's been a really useful tool the past 3 years.  Part of my best invested money."
"I purchased  these for my twin granddaughters. They love the hello kittys.  I should have ordered another package, because they keep loosing them around the house!"
"I love the product. Very cute and it stays longer than normal pacifier. But, it is much small than I thought."
"OK.. everything is all right. All perfect, product is the same of the sale. Very beatiful and cool. I Recomend"
We Absolutely love this Pacifier! My daughter never loses it and she snuggles with the giraffe as she falls asleep
"This is my favorite pacifier. I bought it when my baby was 3 months old. I love that my baby can better keep this in her mouth. Of course, sometimes she still grabs onto the lamb and pulls it out, but the design of this is such that it doesn't fall on the floor nearly as often. I find it most helpful in the car. I can tuck the lamb in the seatbelt straps to somewhat keep it in place, but it is still loose enough that she can pull it out if she really doesn't want it. I bought a second one (different animal). There are so many cute ones to choose from."
"OK.. everything is all right. All perfect, product is the same of the sale. Very beatiful and cool. I Recomend"
"I live in Brazil and here it is difficult to find this product. Everywhere I go with my son using a pacifier, all love!<br />Besides beautiful, it is still very safe and comfortable."
"He absolutely loves his giraffe.  It stays in his crib easier then a regular pacifier, which can fall between the slats.  He loves holding on the the cuddly giraffe."
"This pacifier is soo cute. My son really likes it. It is easy to use, the animal is soft and goes with us everywhere! One of his favorite things!"
This product was delivered exactly as I expected. I am very happy with this item and look forward to giving it as a gift.
These are great but my baby didn't take them--not the products fault. It is well made and worth the price.
The wubbanub is the most amazing thing ever made! It works great to always have in the car seat! Even if they don't always need the pacifier part all the time! Lol its really nice for when they spit it out! Much easier to catch before it hits the ground! Love mine! :)
This is the only kind of paci both my daughter and son would take. The price is great and they are perfect for us.
"I bought this for my 4 month old as he had trouble maneuvering his regular pacifier.<br /><br />I am quite impressed at how well made the overall product is made. The monkey is soft and with beans in the hands and feet. The pacifier, which is a Soothie, the same kind they give you in hospitals, is very securely attached. I've tugged on it and have no concerns about it coming off.<br /><br />As I it comes with a Soothie, which is Monkey's favourite, he took to it right away. There was a slight learning curve in getting him used to it, but he quickly got the hang of it."
My grandson loves his giraffe wubbanub.  It makes finding the pacifier easy and gives him something to hang on to.
We use these and the similar Gumdrop paci but these are just a little softer and our little one's favorite.
Philips AVENT  is the only satisfying pacifier for my baby girl.  She does not like any of the other brand pacifiers.
"Started off with the Lamb and then because it was such an important part of grandson's accommodation to play and security,ordered other animals.  East for the baby and parents, can catch easily and lays on baby's chest.  Love to see him cuddle the animals."
"My baby doesn't like any pack at first. But with persistence, these pack works. Comparing to the Avent Soothie (very popular and has the same nipple), I like this one better because it has the nose cutout and also the holder has a hole for me to string through a clipper. Also, it's a good deal for 5. I rotate them all day long"
This is our third Wubbunub binky as back up. It is a great size for little hands and little mouths.
My daughter saw a friend had a collection of these so being a toddler she also must have one.  She loves it & wants to take it everywhere but it's small can can easily be lost or misplaced (like we have).
Best introduction to sports for a baby.  Loved the product<br />It was exactly has advertised.  I would give this as a gift again and again
These pacifiers glow in the dark which is so helpful when your baby wakes up crying because she lost her pacifier. They are great quality and they are designed and developed by pediatric dentists and orthodontists. I feel comfortable letting my infant suck on them and they really seem to soothe her.
this makes bath time super easy for our little one. she loves getting into her tub.  very convenient and portable.
love this product. it goes so well with my baby's room. very happy with this purchase. i recommend purchasing this product.
these have been the nicest baby blankets we have ever had. they are very large which make it easy to swaddle.
"it is easy to assemble .safe,comfortable,high quality .i love this stroller ,my little one loves it too.first gift for her"
"this backpack is adorable, and although she hasn't started using it daily, it seems to me that the quality is great. i'll update review if that proves to be incorrect. the colours are really nice and the size is perfect for the matching lunch bag and a few workbooks to fit in. if you need much more than that to go in this wouldn't be a great option. it couldn't fit a full size binder from what i can tell. if you need to carry a full size file folder (8.5\\ x 11\\) then this is not a great option. it's rounded top makes it too small to hold that size of item."
"we had a cheap graco for our daughter for the first 2 years of her life. it would constantly beep for out of range (even though the unit never moved) and was full of white noise. we moved to a four level home two weeks ago and i was desperate for something that could do the trick, no matter where i was in relation to her room. we decided to splurge on this unit and i could not be any more impressed and pleased. great video quality, no white noise, lots of variations on how we listen/watch, and perfect reception from one end of the house to the other on every level. i would highly recommend this to anybody/everybody. (i loved the $40 off coupon from soltech as well.) this has been the best &#34;new house&#34; purchase made so far!"
"i bought a pair of these to be used with my grand-children. my daughters-in-law both told me they worked great in shopping carts and in the high chair. for reference, my grand-daughters are 10 months and 11 months."
always a good idea. i use them for straps on our teeter totter (they don't have safety straps and they should). portable and can be used for many purposes. not just for shopping carts.
"these are the best transition nipples from bottle to cup, but they are a bit expensive for just the nipples, i just wish they had them in the stores... luckily i was able to get free shipping."
"this seat is great!  my 3 year old daughter loves it, she is able to sit at the table and it is comfortable.  we even used it our atv side by side rzr, worked great!"
"i bought the long and two short guard rail covers and am very happy with my purchase.  it is a great buy, fits well and my baby is putting it to the test with his teeth and the covers are holding up well!"
"this item is awesome. my son so wanted to sit and his neck was ready for that and eating solids, but he didn't realize that moving too much would get him to fall. this chair helped him get stabilized and now he sits without it. i also used it for feeding until my son was big enough for his kind of large high chair."
None available.
"we couldnt get our baby to take *any* pacifier and heard about this brand. the first time she tried it, she was hooked! it's truly a miracle paci and i do believe it mimics the breast in a way no other paci does. it's worth the price to soothe a fussy baby, trust me!!!"
"this drying station is working well for us! we use dr. brown's glass bottles and the prongs hold the bottles up well. as other reviewers have noted, this doesn't come with a tray so you need to put down a towel or something - which isn't a problem for me, and it means that the whole thing can have a nice slim profile.<br /><br />this has enough prongs for a few bottles, dr. brown's air-reduction stuff, and pumping paraphernalia."
"i use this bag all the time. it's got plenty of room and plenty of pockets without being overwhelming and losing too many things. i've only used it for two months, so i haven't experienced any wear and tear yet. i would recommend this bag."
"it is the best mobile i could imagine for my baby. there are some reasons to buy exactly this model. taking in consideration the short period of time it will serve as an entertainment for a baby (up to 5 months old more less), you can use it attaching to the crib, playard, car seat, and even stroller. my baby does not sleep in the crib during the day time. she wakes up, stays in crib for a half an hour and goes with me downstairs to the playard where i easily attach the mobile and go to do whatever i need to do while she smiles and talks with her mobile for another half an hour. i take it to walk attaching it to the stroller as well and get amazed how long she can follow the little toys with her eyes. she really loves it...."
"Bought this for my 5 month old grandson and he embraced it right away.  He doesn't use a pacifier so he seems to find Dino comforting.  Holds it in his arms while he sleeps.  This is well made, bright color and soft to the touch.  Just ordered an identical one in case Dino gets lost and to use while washing and drying one."
I bought these a couple of months ago and are working fine.  I saw a couple of reviews that say they didn't last long.  Not to sure about that.  My child doesn't use them all the time but have been fine so far.  They are just like the picture and look cute when your child uses it.
"I was leery of giving my breastfed baby a pacifier, but at ten weeks I realized it was what would help him relax during the witching hour as an oversupply prevented him from finding comfort at the breast. He loves to stick his thumb in the hole, which is cute and I think will help him wean from it in the future. His thumbs are getting beefier and I think he'll soon prefer that to the pacifier. You definitely need this 6 pack as pacifiers disappear quickly! Also, my baby has had no nipple confusion with these."
"My son loves this product. He can not put it down, and it helps because it never gets lost.  Now my sister wants one for her kid as well"
My baby love it! And I think  it is the best pacifier to stay in baby's mouth. And the little animals makes it even more cuter and easy to baby hands to hold it.
EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDS AND CAME IN A TIMELY FASHION. JUST WISH I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FOUR INSTEAD OF TWO.
Best pacifier ever! I purchased another one right after I received the first one. A perfect gift for baby shower!
"Bought this one as a gift for friends baby boy, enjoys it as much as my baby girl. Amazing quality and product can recommend !!"
Really love these binkies!!!  Used them with my second baby and also now with our third!!  The ring is a huge plus when carrying for baby and is also great for binkie clips!!  Baby loves them too!!  ;)
"This is so soft and lovely. It's perfect for the baby to hold on to and then snuggle at the same time. A baby that can reach for things can find it easily in the crib at night. I wish the pacifier came in a larger size for older babies, although, I have found, that my baby is not picky to the little difference in the size. I wouldn't let that deter a parent of an older baby to try this out."
this is perfect for what we needed. we put it on top of a dresser to create a changing table. it is a great size and the sides make it feel more secure while i am changing the baby.
"this diaper changer is great. we use it &#34;on the go&#34; but also around the house all the time.<br /><br />the pad is very big, so the baby is really comfortable and we'll be able to use it for a long time. i really like the little bags that came with it, really useful to dispose of the dirty diaper.<br /><br />i bought it for my husband, thinking that he will need a discrete diaper changer and not one pink or something like that, it turns out it is very discrete but i also love it and use it all the time!<br /><br />i'm really happy with this purchase. highly recommended."
"we use this for cloth diapering. it is better than the diaper genie at keeping smell in - and we don't even use a scent thing in the top. it's in our bedroom where the changing table is. never smells unless we open it and, hello people, whether we all like it or not, smell comes out when we open a diaper pail. but when it's closed, the smell stays in and doesn't leak at all. the only issue i have is it's a bit small, but we have 2 girls in cloth diapers, and we wash every 2 days, and it fits 2 days of 2 kids diapers easily. so i guess it's not that small. we line it with a pul lined bag or a trash bag, and the lid still works well. just make sure you snap the lid on right."
i gave this as a shower gift and the parents say they can't do without it. easy to use and easy to get the baby in and out
"i used to use the lansinoh bags only, but have found these to be cheaper and got many good reviews, so i decided to give it a try. i think the bag material is even thicker than the lansinoh ones! no problem with freezing and thawing as well. hasn't leaked at all. i haven't used it as a liner though, so i can't comment on that aspect of it."
great my grandson loves it going to order the bracelet.  helps with the teething from what my daugher in law says
"this was for a gift, but my daughter loves hers and i used hers yesterday and loved it.  will purchase again"
one word...love! this bag is exactly what i needed. it's huge with tons of functional pockets. built well and comfortable. exactly as described!
thank you for a wonderful product
"this sheet is great! it is like a fitted sheet at the bottom (with elastic at the corners), so it stays on my 2-year old daughter's bed with all of her tossing & turning! wish they made big people sheets like this!"
"although these are pricy, they are worth their weight in gold! love the colors, ease of use and safety was the main issue. recommend to anyone!"
my wife and i tried a thousand bottle brushes . this is by far the best. buy the one with the stand. keeps germs away and your counter clean too.
"my twins, the double a's got these and were off.  this item can grow with them too!  love them. i always do my research and read the reviews on the products i purchase and this just happened to be the best product out there."
"UPDATE: We've used this for about two and a half years and it held up well, functioning as intended, until now. The reason it ripped is both my children decided to hang on it at the same time.<br /><br />I was able to repair it using dental floss and a sewing needle, then covering the sewing with duct tape to deter my little ones from trying to get to the threads.<br /><br />I will replace the broken unit with a new one of the same as soon as possible. We use this gate very heavily (10-20 times a day most days) and I think it's good that it held up this long.<br /><br />Yes, it is loud. Yes, it is possible to get it caught up while it's retracting, but overall, it's a good product. If you have an area where a regular gate just isn't s good option, this is a good alternative.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have no complaints about this product. It's perfect for areas where you don't necessarily need protection all the time, but want the option to have it. We use metal gates for the stairs, and kitchen, but we use this for the bottom of the stairs because out daughter doesn't usually have a chance to climb them without us knowing.<br /><br />It is a little more complicated to operate than a metal swinging gate, but perfect for areas where you don't have to use it all th time."
I like this brand of pacifier wipes a lot better than the Arm & Hammer ones. These are more moist and have a nice apple scent/taste to them. This large container is a convenient size too - easy plastic dispensing lid that you pop up with just a touch.
"Very cute, it is the only pacifier that my baby would take. The only downside is that for babies too young (less than 4 months) the plush toy gets in the way of their hands and the pacifier keeps falling out of their little mouths. But once they learn how to use their hands, they start playing (chewing) with the toy. Adorable."
These are the only paci's my baby will take...she is completely breastfed and these do not confuse her. I will recommend these to anyone.
"I love this thing, more like my son loves this a lot he is always holding it and everything.  we do not regret getting this that's for sure id recommend this to everyone."
"The Wubba Nub Giraffe is very soft, beautiful, and adorable. My baby loves it and I take it everywhere with her."
"Great concept, borne no doubt out of the reality that pacifiers tend to be dropped, and when they drop, they bounce to unseen places. These WubbaNubs work so well for both baby and parent. If your child likes a pacifier, this one will help them hold on to it, and play with."
"These pacifiers are GREAT!  They go the distance!!  You can wash them in the dishwasher, or in the sink--they hold up!!"
Got it for my preemie grandson. Elephant lays on his chest and helps to keep pacifier in his mouth. Plus I love elephants.
This is the most ADORABLE addition to my little man EVER. He is so cute with it in his mouth def worth the money for all the pictures alone.
"I bought this before my Grandson was born.  This, out of all his pacifiers is his favorite.  He holds on to it when he is asleep for comfort."
My granddaughters both love these! They are easy for their little hands to hold and easy to clean. The styles are pretty cute too!
The best thing about these is there easy to wash and both my kids loved them for the short time they used them..
pacifier also serves as teething type of ring.  bought for great grand daughter and she loves it. would recommend to all new mothers.
This is the only pacifier we can consistently get our little one to take. We are very happy with it!
Huge hit at the bar and all the bartenders and patrons were laughing but wish they came in only black and brown....
"We got this for a friend and sent it to them, but as far as I know, there are no complaints!"
These were recommended to me by a nurse and they are great - they are smaller and nicer on my daughter's face!  They hold up wonderfully and the six pack is perfect!
My little girl loves this thing! I even bought the elephant one for her and ordered one for a friends baby! Great product!!
"We love WubbaNub!<br /><br />1.  It's really hard to lose.<br />2.  It's more difficult for baby to knock out of his mouth on accident.  It may take some maneuvering to find the right position, but it's certainly better than all our other Soothie pacifiers.<br />3.  It's a Soothie.  Love these!<br />4.  How stinkin' cute is the little duck?  Our little one is just about 3 months and he's finally starting to notice WubbaNub.  We'll see if he becomes attached to it.  Who knows???"
I just HAD to purchase this to go along with an  upcoming baby shower gift after watching another friend's 1 month old cuddle this sweet little monkey in his fists while sleeping away with the pacifier in his mouth. Seriously one of the sweetest sights!.  Perfect for not having pacifiers spit out and dropped in unsanitary places. Small enough for the littlest of babies but enough  to grow with. I will definitely be buying an assortment of these when my day comes to be a mother. :)
"with two grandchilren, i wanted to find books that you can read to babies. ethan enjoyed this book and will more when he comes back for a vivst."
"this is a well made easy fit and easy clean product. its suitable for both children and dogs which is the reason i bought it. my dogs love it because whilst they are separated they can see through the fabric and also being so small, they cant get stuck in the gaps in between the rails that standard pet gates are normally made of. i also love it because its sturdy and there is no drilling and permanent fixing to your walls or openings. the only down side is that its not a walk through gate, you have to step over it and also that i cannot find anything as wide in the uk without paying a silly amount of money for it. amazon were quick in delivering too. overall i would give this a 9& half out of 10. great product."
the playtex diaper genie products are wonderful. my purchases were made from a gift registry on amazon.  the travel genie and its' refills what a blessing.  much better than the &#34;good ole days&#34; of hauling and dunking cloth diapers!!!!!!
bought for daughter and son-in-law for baby expected in january. great with the two pieces that go with it. love it!
"this has been great. we use the ice pack for teething and also for bruises/bumps. it makes the teether that much easier to find, plus the penguin is super cute. love that it's gender neutral too so if you have a boy and then pass down to a girl, it works for both genders. also- it's bpa free which is a huge relief because i am very picky about what plastics i let my daughter play with"
this mattress fits perfect in the pack and play and is firm enough to have our angelcare monitor sit underneath it.  very good mattress
"we use it a blanket for our baby at home, or tummy time mat or as a carseat canopy when we are out and as a stroller blanket.  we live in san francisco, it is fall weather all year round, so it is perfect for our weather, not too thick and not too thin."
"i bought this for my sister. her baby shower is in october (it's august) and her theme is owls for her expected little girl. she put a boring pink album on the list but said she only picked it because it was the only girl one at her store! i bought this one instead (and told the place to take the other off the registry for me!). it's tooooo adorable! it's got a nice shiny finish on the front and back like a library book would (only done much nicer) to protect it. the pages are great, smooth and you can certainly fit a lot of pictures into it. something i hadn't noticed until i got it was that it has a little spot for a cd/dvd at the back of the book so you can add a dvd of special moments or a cd of pictures that couldn't fit in the book (considering baby's first years are so precious you try to capture every moment on camera!). definitely worth the $18 i spent on it (and a double plus that it had prime!)."
"bought this as a gift for good friends of ours. they loved the frame. it's pretty, and looks nice. hope this review helps!"
"this tote bag totally spoke to my sense of humor. it is exactly as pictured,straps are sewn on with lots of stitching, but would not put too many heavy objects in it. makes me want school to get started!"
"installs in a second and works perfectly. i love how when you use this adaptor you can use both sunshades, the one on the stroller and the one on the car seat."
the quality was even better than we had anticipated!  the little one loves the baby animals that are decorating the bottom and sides.
"well-made quality back pack! i love that i can have all my hands free with baby and all the supplies!  and i love my husband can take it and pack it and not feel weird about carrying a woman's purse--which is what a lot of diaper bags look like now. the two zipped pockets on the inside are nice and roomy. i am a breast feeding mom, there are more than enough compartments for keys, nursing supplies, changing supplies, sunglasses, and extra clothes for my son. i really love it. the quality of the bag is well made, just like the baby carrier. i love them both."
my granddaughter loves sleeping with this soft cozy &#34;rub it&#34; that we call them here.  perfect size for a newborn.
i wasn't sure how well i liked the idea of a video monitor and i couldn't be more pleased with this one.  this has made checking in on my little ones much easier and doesn't startle them with the opening of a door or that pesky creaking floorboard.  i would definitely recommend this monitor.
It has a great quality of video. I have two other of different brands and they don't work as good.
"my 3 month old still slept better swaddled, but he was a little houdini and came unwrapped from swaddle blankets. this stayed secure, resulting in longer nighttime sleep and eliminated my worry about loose blankets getting over the baby's mouth and nose."
great for keeping baby warm in northern canada! i would recommend going up a size then what you normally are wear for extra room! loved it! can't wait to use it again!
perfect to keep an eye on the little on while driving and she can see me as well. its great!
i had to buy a second one of these.  moo moo has been my daughter's favorite cuddler since she was 6 months old.  she can't seem to sleep without it.
"this is the second davinci crib i have purchased in the last 2 years...both as gifts for my 2 grandchildren. this is a superior product for the price and looks beautiful.  the crib we bought 2 years ago is still holding up and looks brand new.  my daughter in nc loves it! the second crib is waiting for baby to arrive, but my daughter in michigan loves the look in the nursery. excellent product!"
"added another german shepherd to the family.  she didn't respect the shorter baby gate like her older brother so figured we would get something bit taller and more permanent.  installed it using the cups that go into the door frame for added insurance.  love the fact that we don't have to take it down to go in and out.  my door opening didn't require the use of the two extensions, but saved them just in case we need to move it"
these are super cute.  the colours are neutral and i can see getting wear out of them because they will match different outfits.  not sure if the baby will love them as much because they aren't bright colours.
"My husband the dentist was skeptical of pacifiers because of teeth problems, but he is fine with these, and they work great!"
My daughter has had one of these since she was a newborn. She's 2 now & doesn't go anywhere without it.  She literally wears them out.  I buy them 2 at a time so I can always have a clean one available.  She loves hers so much!
"Easy to clean and great quality my daughter refuses to use any other kind, would highly recommend these to anyone"
"My son had awful reflux, and I was unable to lay him down for 9 months. Seriously. Hell. This was our savior (along with the rock n' play rocker). He used them until he was 2. Literally EVERY photo of him from ages 4 months-2 years feature his beloved giraffe. We had a few on rotation, and the giraffes held up GREAT through washing (we would boil them, throw them in the washing machine, etc.) Love love love. We gift these at every baby shower!"
"Perfect for any baby Patriots fan, my little guy is a little picky when it comes to pacifiers but took these ones right away and now he looks like a real Pats fan and ready for football season!!"
Great product at a great price....my 5 month old loves it!! He's so. Sweet when he cuddles ip with it:o)
"This item is cute, perfect for one or two pacifiers only. Its good to keep a spare pacifier just in case the one in your baby's mouth falls out and gets dirty. It's an accessorie, looks cute and stylish. Not really needed but useful ...Just in case.<br /><br />Keep in mind this only fits two pacifiers."
"My daughter has become obsessed with these! they are so great, i got her first one when she was just a few months old and I loved it for car rides so when she spat it out it would stay on her chest in case she wanted it again, I think it really helped her with hand eye coordination as well. I have the lamb, caterpillar and elephant. super cute."
Looks exactly like the picture. looks cute when baby has it. makes for cute pictures especially if your a tigers fan.
"This Pacifier is fashion,very beautiful,I  feel my duaghter like it very much,I feel<br />I love it ,so.you should buy it,"
High quality. One of my daughter's favorites! It's just like the Soothie she got as a newborn in the hospital.
My boys have two each just in case we lose one.  They will not use any other pacifier.  Great product.
My boys have two each just in case we lose one.  They will not use any other pacifier.  Great product.
"Loved it, Fits to pacifiers nicely. Although snap isnt as strong, for when you want to attach it to the diaper bag."
"I bought this for a gift, so I am not sure if the baby actually will use it.  It was funny for the new mom to open and well worth the giggles."
"This little stuffed animal is about the size of an understuffed Beanie Baby....perfect for tiny little fists to hold. And the pacifier is permanently attached...so, it's easier to see when it's gone overboard! Ingenious! I think it arrived about 2 or 3 days after I ordered it."
"My baby loves these pacifiers, they are the only brand she really took to.  You don't know which colors you will get until they arrive but I have only seen two different color choices in my local stores so any change is good, and she doesn't really need to co-ordinate pacifiers with her outfits."
such an adorable little pacifier. I bought this for as a baby shower gift and the mom to be loved it!
"Our daughter immediately took to the Wubbanubs (was previously using the Soothie pacifier by itself), and loves them. We love them because they were so much easier for her to learn to place/keep in her mouth herself. And I don't think we even have to mention the cute factor."
"It is my daughter's first baby and it's a girl!!!!! This pacifier was a little &#34;lighter&#34; in color than it looks on here, but I love it! and I know mom, dad, and baby will love it too!"
My 6 month old loves it and uses it anytime is teeth start to bug him. I heard some people complain about taste or smell but I think they neglected the instructions on cleaning and boiling. Overall great product that does its job and is a healthy choice for a growing baby.
This has been the only pacifier my baby has used.  He loves it and uses it when he sleeps.  I like that it has a cover to keep it clean.  I clean it in soapy water and sterilize it in my Avent steamer.
"If the little one likes it and it helps to soothe him, then there isn't anything more that needs saying."
"can not wait to have my little man here , everyone told me that these are amazing so i went ahead and got a set. they arrived before i thought they would"
"Sturdy, easy to use, my kids each have had &#34;their&#34; paci chain that we keep long after the paci departs."
My child loves the WubbaNub! Easy to hang on to and cuddle with plus she enjoys playing with it during our car rides.
"For our first baby we bought a variety of pacifiers. She didn't end up needing one much, but when she did, this was her favorite. I bought hoping it would keep the pacifier in her mouth. She is an active one and her hands would always knock the pacifier out. It did help some but not as much as I would have liked. However it does do something for her because I have a pacifier exactly like the one on the dog and it doesn't do the trick. She is at the point where she wants to grab ahold of something and this perfect. Needless to say we don't leave home for long without it. Oh beware you get tons of comments. Everyone who see her with it thinks it is adorable and just raves about it. My sister thought it was so cute, she bought her 3 more, different animals of course!"
Most parents say not to go with the pacifier but i bought tons before i found one that worked for my son.  This was the only one he would take.  The seam where the Silicone meets the plastic seems to get a little dirtybut this can be cleaned easily.
"We have been very pleased with all Dr. Brown's products. We have their bottles, bottle warmer, pacifiers, and more. With our second child on the way we decided to stick with what we were used to and happy with. My daughter is 15 months and only uses the Dr. Brown's pacifiers when she is napping or sleeping, never had an issue with her not liking this brand."
These are THE best pacifiers to soothe new babies. Besides getting a pacifier they have a soft toy to hold - nicer than a pacifier on a string.
Bought this on a whim and sure glad I did. My wife laughed at me initially but now she loves it as much as the baby.  Even at just 6 weeks old we've seen our daughter maneuver the wubbanub back into her mouth if close by!
These pacifiers are so cute and perfect for your little princess!  I can't wait until mine arrives and gets to use them!
Works just as expected and my boy loves it.  It keeps him pacified when he's asleep and it stays close so when he wakes up he can easily reach for it.  Wish they made them with older kid pacifiers to prevent any teeth development issues.
"i thought this was the coolest thing when i found it and come to find out, i've used it once. it works perfectly fine exactly like the directions but would be a waste if you're not chopping food everyday anyways. if you have babies and have to chop everything then it would be perfect."
"good to find a boy-color-themed set of pacifiers! the colors are bright without being garish, and the nipples are smooth and strong for your baby to suck on safely. keep in mind that you can probably get these for a better price at your local cvs, though."
"i have two children, ages 2 and 4, and another on the way, so we needed a way to fit all three kids safely in the back seat of my 2005 toyota camry. after a lot of research, the diono radian kept coming up as the best space-saving car seat out there. i originally just bought one to use for my 2-year-old daughter since her 4-year-old brother was already in a booster seat (using the car's seat belt). after installing our graco infant seat behind the passenger seat, putting the diono in the middle, and having the booster behind the driver, i soon realized trying to buckle the car seat belt for my son was going to be a nightmare every time we got in and out of the car. i came back and purchased a second diono radian for him and replaced his booster seat. all three seats now fit great in the back seat using the car seat belt installation method (not latch)."
really worth the price.looks good and it's secure.my child loves it too.i really suggest you should get this kind instead of spending more money on stuff where kids grow everyday
"Much more firm then I expected, but I kinda like that. My son enjoys it. Cool toy. Worth the money for me."
"Our son (8 months) really loves these pacifiers. He doesn't accept any other. Since we ordered the pacifiers from Germany, we especially appreciate that the seller did fill in the customs form correctly. Therefore, everything went smoothly with German customs."
"these are great. made in the usa. bpa free, and short enough that kids can use them easily. they are easy to clean and the forks are not sharp enough to poke hols in other things in a bag (or the kids mouth). great product. hope this review is helpful."
these are great little cars.  i have about 4 different packs and the small mobile.  i have it above the changing station and switch them out regularly.  my little one loves to name them while we get changed every day!  :)
my 2 1/2 year old and 16 month old boys use this table all the time! i painted it and put polyacrylic (spelling?) on it and put laminate tiles on the table top and chair surface so it's easy to keep clean.  also used wood glue when assembling which i'm sure made it much more sturdy.
this sign is perfect for reminding visitors to take it slow in the driveway. very visible and good quality corrugated plastic.
has a good locking system to keep baby out of my cupboards. looks like shoe laces only nicer esp since i had tied all sorts of weird looking things.
love this purchase! very happy!! have been looking for the perfect item and found it! very pleased with this! thanks!!
thanks it came quickly and it is super cute! looks great in the baby's room. i like how it can change colors.
"this is the perfect size and price for a toddler, especially when you consider she drags it everywhere with her. i ended up buying three: one for daycare, one to carry around, and one for her toddler bed. can't beat it for the price!"
"love these bibs. the snaps are great so no more velcro scratches. also, they are super absorbent so for the drooly-teething tots, they are perfect. great for feedings too."
"this bathtub mat stays in place, easy to clean, cute and adds safety to your bathroom! easy to install as well!  ;-)"
"i had graco products with my first child, and looking around there weren't very many patterns/colors that i liked other than this one. i purchased this item and love it. i was a little worried as i  purchased one of the \\open box\\ items that said it had minor cosmetic damage. i got it in the mail and the box is the only thing that was damaged! i would definitely recommend if you don't want to spend the full price, to buy the \\open box\\ items with minor damage. it is worth it!"
"my little one kept losing her pacifier, so i had to get up at night to get it for her. this little toy is a wonderful solution! you can use your own pacifier, which makes it even better."
"i bought this for my 2 1/2 year old's toddler bed.  i really like the quality and construction.  it's warm, thick and soft and my toddler loves her new sheets.<br /><br />the background is bright white and they are a little thick and stiff out of the pretty packaging but they're wonderful after a wash.  apart from the organic line, i haven't seen any shrinkage in swaddledesigns products.  the colors and print match my other swaddledesigns products and i like that i can reuse her outgrown ultimate receiving blankets as top sheets.<br /><br />this is a good buy."
"perfect to keep your little one entertained in a bubble bath, which isn't an easy task some nights for sure."
i love this pillow!  its shaped well and firm with a touch of softness from the foam.  and the height is the best i can find for a little toddler.  would definitely buy again and recommend to my friends.
i needed a quick gift for the godmother and it was very high quality for the price. it is beautiful and i personalized it more by printing out my own photo and gave her the frame with the photo in it. i would buy again for another godmother.
this worked out so well for what i wanted it it for! i loved the fact that i did not have to install hardware to the banister and i like that it was easy to open for all members of my family. i needed it to keep my medium sized dogs on the first floor and it has done the job! i had looked at stores and the prize was unbeatable for the quality of gate. it's iron so my dog could not chew thrown it like the other  wooded stuff around. i'm very happy and satisfied with this product. :-)
"these bumpers were a bit difficult to install the first time, but in view of their light weight and soft surfaces, i rate them a 5"
so cute and wonderful to buy for your child or as a gift. it arrived in time and well packed. when my sons is using it everyone comments on it and ask where to get it from.
Very soothing for my daughter and easy to find. I keep it clean by putting it through the washing machine and it washes up nicely.
"Bought this for my nephew, it's his favorite binky of all time! He loves to look at himself in the mirror with it. So much fun!"
"My son almost exclusively uses Wubbanub pacifiers.  They are great - you can't lose them easily, and they keep the pacifier close so you can get it back in your baby's mouth quickly without digging around trying to find it after it's spit out.  I didn't believe it at first, but infants also like to hug the little toy.  Of the three Wubbanubs I have, the frog Wubbanub is my least favorite, only because it doesn't seem to be as weighted and falls off my son's chest easier than the duck or giraffe Wubbanub.  But it still works great and is very cute."
"We LOVE our giraffe Wubbanub!  I bought one before our baby was born to try it out, since I thought it was expensive for a pacifier.  But it's worth every penny.  It's great for keeping the pacifier close, babies love to snuggle the soft toy, and you don't lose pacifiers when your baby spits them out.  I ended up buying two more Wubbanubs because I liked this one so much!"
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha my wife thinks its just a reason for me to keep my mustache hahahahaha he looks so awesome its the coolest thing i have ever bought my son
Very happy with this.  Looks better in person than it does in the photos.  Love how his little mustache bobs when he sucks on the binky.
At first our 1 month old didn't really like this but it comes in handy when she's still looking for something to put in her mouth after feedings.  This little gizmo will help put her right to sleep!  It also stays put so she can get it back in her mouth even when swaddled up.
I love these. I use them for my business and I order them all the time. My customrs love them also.
"My baby loves these! When she was brand new she didn't really like them but now that she is older, she loves them! It's the only kind she really uses anymore :]"
The gift was well received by the parents and the young man will not go to sleep without it.  A great gift and everyone who sees it loves it.
"Wish I would have known about these a few years ago with my first daughter!!! This pacifier is a life saver. Nothing is more frustrating than having your child love a pacifier but struggling to keep it in their mouth. Finally the WubbaNub makes this possible. Its weighted so that when they are in the swing, stroller, car seat etc. it can sit on their chest and helps keep it in. If it does fall out it doesn't go far and my 6 week old daughter is able to find it with her mouth and put it back in. Thank you for the peace and quiet! Worth every penny."
This where a basic pacifier for the nights! When the baby lost the pair we missed them. it is great to have a shining pacifier during night as it allows you to find it on the bed without the need of turning lights on!
Gave these things to a friend as a gift for their new baby and they have been really helpful .
"My oldest daughter picked this out for her new little sister and she loves it! It is super cute and stays in the baby' s mouth which is a huge blessing. It is very cute and you can wash it in the washing machine, just put it in a bag. The only thing i didnt like was the price, which i do think is a little high, but it is a great product."
i previously ordered the graco twin bassinet but realized i may need to separate the twins so they can sleep if one is awake and vice versa. this should be great!
i like it if the price can be cheaper. it will be very good. colour is nice. and it is usefull.
"love it<br />yes, i would tell anyone wanting to buy something unique this is it<br />when the baby gets fussy or waiting for a bottle i use this to keep them quiet<br />3-4 times a day or when ever you need it<br />just a plain old pacifier<br />the quality was above my expectations"
"great product, will see if my baby likes it too. love the color, it is not as pink as in the picture, but i actually like it better."
"i am so happy with britax pavilion 70-g3 convertibe car seat. my 9 months old son really like it. his head is supported, straps are easy to close and overall when my baby is in this car seat it looks like he is really comfy and safe at the same time."
"my almost 2 year old absolutely loves this set.  she spent two or three day's carrying the pillow around with her.  i thought it might be a bit rough since it was so cheap, but its really very soft."
"we use this mirror in my husbands car with good results.  easy to install and adjust.  does need readjustment periodically.  can't really use it in my car, however, because the straps attach around the headrest and my headrest is more of an attached bump rather than a separate headrest."
"i bought two sets, and i love it. i cook my baby's solid foods, and these works for containers as well as serve bowls. it is microwavable and easy to clean. it is very handy, and i use it everyday serving my baby solid food."
"we have two of these that are washed with the diaper load, so one is always clean.  we have been using them about 6 months with no problems.  they go in the hot wash inside out, then hang to dry with the diapers."
"these were perfect for our new baby. a little bulky for a newborn, but i'm glad i bought these instead of newborn size which would have been outgrown very quickly. perfect for stuffing nearly any diaper cover, very absorbent, and also great for spit rags, napkins, cleaning rags, etc."
"it really does make more room. before the angle adjuster, my husband couldnt drive my car because even though the car seat is in the middle, the front seat would be blocked from moving back from hitting the side corner of the car seat (rear facing). we got the angle adjuster and it gave so much room. i am 5'2 and my husband is 6 foot!"
i ended up getting this toy since i have heard such good things from it that i just had to get it for my 2 month old. he loves it so far! it so adorable and cute! very soft and good teether also.
"i have my son's room as a frog-theme and this fits in perfectly. for &#60; $10, i thought it would be cheaply-made, but the support rods are actually quite sturdy and do a great job at keeping the product from &#34;deflating&#34; or sinking into itself. it has nice handles on the side as well, so it's easy to transport in and out of the laundry room."
"i ordered these for thank you notes for my wedding gifts. they are very simple, but that's what i wanted. the envelopes are a tight fit, but they do fit. i only wish the box they come in had a way to close. it comes in a box with no lid."
"they have just the basics, but they were great.  the signal lights are just bright enough that we can see them during the day, but not so bright that it's annoying at night.<br /><br />we never used the night light function much since the light was pretty unsubstantial."
i was scared all my little guys toys wouldn't fit in this but they do! when i first saw the size of the mesh netting i was worried. we used to store his toys in a medium size sand pale and we can fit all of them and more! suction devices work phenomenally. i've been using it for over 2 months now and they are yet to fall.  no moldy smells are slimy toys anymore!
We callit Steak and he loves it :) We never lose it and he's easy to find in the dark or the car. My son also loves having something to hold onto.
"One of my favorites for my children.  These are so easy for your baby to find when looking for them.  As they get older, they can hold onto them without them falling all over the place and getting dirty, and won't have to wake you up in the middle of the night if they misplace it, my babies always seemed to find it because of the stuffed animal at the end that is easy to grab.  Some of animals sit better then others - the frog, monkey, and cat have a flat stomach so they can sit flat on your infant, so keep that in mind. I have 2 of these for my second child and he's kept up with both of them."
"It's so fun that my four year old wants house it as a toy. Perfect for it's purpose, keeps the pacifier clean, it's a bit bulky."
"I love how soft and cuddly this giraffe is. My 5 month old loves to hold something soft when she's got her thumb, or a soother in her mouth and this checks both the boxes! Eliminates the need to carry a soother AND a small blanket or toy."
My  daughter loves the pacifier holder for the diaper bag. She loves it for carrying an extra pacifier since it is so easy to misplace them. Very good price and nice products. I am happy I purchased it for her & I Would recommend them.
The pacifiers themselves are great. But the 'colors may vary' concept caused us to end up with a girls set rather than a boy's set. But other than that these are great. :)
My son has the monkey its &#34;His Monkey&#34; and he loves it bought this as a gift !!!! hope they love it too
I love this I bought several different animals for gifts but my son has the monkey this monkey is &#34;his monkey&#34; we don't leave that guy behind ! I was afraid this thing wouldn't hold up but my son will be 1 in a month and his monkey is flawless ! I love this I bought several different animals for gifts but my son has the monkey this monkey is &#34;his monkey&#34; we don't leave that guy behind ! I was afraid this thing wouldn't hold up but my son will be 1 in a month and his monkey is flawless !
"It is very adorable to see your baby with this little guy.  My baby loves it, sometimes for the binky and other times for the stuffed toy.  No more loosing the binky, its size makes it easy to find."
"My son will only take these pacifiers, and only on occasion.  These are a little harder/thicker than the 0-3mo soothies, which is fine with my son!  Easy to use, clean, etc.  Great price."
"Its a real problem. I think we have most of the ones that are currently made. My little man will only take a soothie pacifier, and the animals are small enough that he can hold on to them. Plus they are adorable! The alternatives come close, but aren't quite as cute or practical. (I like that the pacifier is attached to the animals mouth as opposed to the back of the head like some of the others). The only thing I wish was different is I wish the pacifier could be separated from the animal for cleaning or changing out pacifier."
Absolutely love this pacifier my sons favorite bedtime companion many compliments on this one. Very easy to find at nightime
"My baby was having a really hard time learning to use a pacifier.  I read reviews on this product and saw others saying it helped their babies to have something to hold onto, so I decided to check it out.  It is awesome!  My baby was able to figure out how to hold onto the toy to keep the pacifier in her mouth, and then learned to keep it in through sucking.  Now at 5 months, she loves to hold and pet this as a lovee, and she chews on all of the monkeys limbs when she isn't in the mood to suck on the pacifier. Definitely a favorite toy in our house!"
"My baby loves this.  I want one of every style.  My kids all like to suck their thumbs, so this works for the baby.  They stick their thumb in the hole without having to wean off their thumbs.<br /><br />Also it was great for my newborns who don't keep a binkie because the stuffed animal helps the binkie stay inside the mouth"
"My son has always had a habit of throwing pacifiers, so chains and clips were a must.  This was one of the most sturdy and durable chains of them all, plus it's colorful and made of wood so kids can play with it as well.  Most of the other clips we had were plastic and easily broken.  My son is 12 months now and this is the only one still around from when he was born.  Great investment!"
"This was, hands down, my little girl's favorite from the time she was a newborn.  She was quite tiny, so other pacifiers were easily lost if she spit them out.  However, her caterpillar Wubbanub was fantastic.  She would play with the antennae while she took the pacifier and, on the rare occasion when it did get away from her, it was MUCH easier to find than a pacifier alone!"
"I bought two of these: one for my daughter and one for a friend.  LOVE the Wubbanub!  My little girl was tiny, so other pacifiers could get lost so easily and fall down into her car seat or furniture.  Not the Wubbanub! I could lay it on her chest while the pacifier part was in her mouth, and she LOVED petting the fur! Also, on the rare occasion that she did drop it, it was MUCH easier to find than a pacifier alone!  HIGHLY recommend!"
Best pacifier ever! My son wouldn't take any other pacifier than this. He absolutely loves it. I totally recomend this product.
My baby wouldn't take to a soother until she was 12 weeks old and she eventually took to this one. We tried sine she was 4 weeks old but something magically happened when she was a little bit older. I only pop these in when she's fussy and needs a nap and we aren't at home. They are the only ones she keeps in her mouth longer than 2 minutes. She's now 5 months old and too old for these and I'm hoping they have a similar version for 3+ months!
I bought it for my baby that don't born yet. But i think that she will love it because i read a lot of things i listen a lot of people and everybody recommend it.
"Infants notoriously spit out pacifiers - it's a fact.<br />We love the Wubbanub because it positions the pacifier in such a way that my daughter can stop sucking for a moment and it does not fall out and roll away.<br />At 14 weeks old, she will now slurp on the legs, tail and head of this thing and is learning to put the pacifier back in on her own - Don't leave home without it!!! :)"
These paci's are great because they are slightly weighted with bean bag limbs. It helps keep the paci in place and the characters make them more visible.

wow you get 2 for the price of one!! my grandson loves these up in his new room . thank you
"this is the 2nd symphony 65 dlx car seat we've purchased. we loved it so much for our older son that when it came time to get a seat for our younger son we didn't think twice! this model is better then the older seat we have. the fabric isn't as absorbent and wipes off easily. the head piece slides up and down to provide support, and the base tilts into 3 positions. my younger son's head still falls forward in this seat when he falls asleep, but as we discovered with other models this is unavoidable in the non-infant seats, and his head falls forward less in this one. the black infant positioner you see in the photo is only good for infants, my son is 1 and too tall for it. i wish the company would come out with a head positioner for this, but all around it's a great seat."
this quote reminds me of my little sister and i love the fact that they included instructions on how to apply!
how great that fisher price made a replacement seat cushion for the deluxe space saver high chair.  very nicely made and washes up well.
"i wasn't sure about getting a &#34;space saver&#34; high chair, but this one is great! it has a rubber track on the bottom and two straps, enabling it to be very securely attached to a chair.  it can recline for a baby who is not quite able to sit up yet and has a center &#34;post&#34; to keep a child from sliding down.  the deluxe version now has wipeable straps and the cover is washable and wipeable too.  the tray and the tray insert can go in the dishwasher.  i like the seat cover--it's cute without being too cutesy and is very unisex.  would definitely purchase this again."
"i use these little guys to freeze spicy garden produce that i would want in small quantities: hot peppers, roasted garlic, hot onions, etc.  they are perfect.  they are not stable when stacked, but just put them in a basket or larger container."
love this item. it goes great with the other accessories i purchased for my son. like how you can take the cars plaque off to transform it into a regular all black dresser. nice product i definitely recommend this
"i bought these after i saw the great reviews and i have to say these are really great. it requires a little patience with a newborn, especially because i cut my baby's nails in her sleep and don't want to wake her. they are very sharp so you have to be careful, but they effectively remove the nails."
"don't waste water filling the bathtub. this tub is great, it is simple, and foldable.  easy to travel with too.  highly recommend."
"i use it to keep my 2 year old grandson out of hazardous areas. unlike many other similar products, it is extremely easy to open for an adult while virtually impossible for my grandson to open."
i love my jj cole broadway stroller and the new color canopy gave it a more fresh look!!<br />i receive compliments all the time on the stroller and people are constantly asking me what it is.  in fact because i have this stroller and people love how easy it is to steer two families from our church had asked me where they can purchase one an they did.  it's a wonderful stroller and the fact that they have different canopy colors makes it so much more appealing!!
what to write ? best stuff... no air pockets when kid drinks.. good ones.<br />no issues as this is second kid using same types...
this is a really nice babybook and it is not at highway robbery prices. remember this is just paper and plastic. how some of the companies ask so much is beyond me.
my baby didn't know what to do at first when i put him in it but now he loves it.
what can i say - it's a boob sucker!  it does what it's supposed to do.  i like these all-in-one designs over the medela personal fit ones where you have to buy each piece separately.
"really love this bag, when i show it to my baby girl, she simply loved it so much. attempt to carry it around the house."
Our baby girl (now 2) loved her caterpillar wubbanub and it made it easier for her to find and hold her pacifier at a young age. Recently purchased Ella the Elephant for our newborn.
I think this is more for the parents then the baby. I got it as a gift and the parents loved it
"My baby prefers this pacifier to all others at 1 month, and it definitely has a soothing effect. Since she liked these so much I bought some more from Target in the vanilla flavor which she loves more than the regular pacifier."
my 7 mo baby boy wears this continuously except when bathing or sleeping.  this necklace has been a lifesaver while he's been teething. i know it works because one day after bathing him i forgot to put it on......after about 24 hours without it he was fussy....put the necklace back on & within a few hours he was fine.
"this is the most valuable item the 'new parents' must have on their survival kit.<br />it's a perfect stroller... it's very strong, big, light weight, and keep very small when it closes.<br />and it's not simple like a poor 'umbrella' model... it more than that. and it's easy to open and close it with only one hand.<br />to sum up... it's a perfect stroller !"
it is in the baby's crib and my daughter requested this item is very happy with the gift of the taggies developmental baby doll
this product works well in my daughter's nursery....it was a nice addition to all the other jojo ladybug parade items that we have purchased for her new addition......
my 6 months old baby loves it!!!! she wants to carry this toy everywhere. i love all the tunes. i highly recommend this product
this is a great product for the price.  i love the auto mute feature and the feature which allows the screen to time out until sounds are made.  our previous monitor didn't have theses features and made it really hard to get a good night's rest.  i highly recommend this product.
"fisher-price products are always quality assurance. how could it be different, this purchase was exactly what you were looking for my baby. now is enjoying to replace the battery!"
"this skip hop whale easily adjust to fit snug on my tub water spout. its soft to the touch and easy to remove and clean. my boys al love the whale. it protects their heads from potentionally a hot metal spout, from hitting their heads on the hard spout, and from other dangers. i have no complaints!"
"on the recent holiday we had friends over, she took &#34;everyone&#34; upstairs to see her room (it brought me great joy). the only thing i would prefer is if the sheets were a soft cotton. for the warmer months i'll have to find matching sheets."
my 2-yr old grandson sleeps on it when he is at our house.  i double a small throw for a pad and use a towel to cover him up.  it works perfectly.
"it suited our crib like it was made for it!<br />now we have our summerholiday, and we make love in the grass."
became my daughters favorite toy/teether. she could hold onto it by herself and she loved the texture. it helped that her first pacifier was also the same flavor from the hospital.
"looks nice and very functional, easy to place. fits various sized doorways. keeps my dog and cat out of rooms to help keep them allergy free."
"If you want quality plush, Mary Meyer is the way to go. Their corporate offices are so helpful and the animals are top quality. I was thrilled to find this dog for my son."
"So happy to find they made gumdrop pacifiers for 6m+!  Our baby loved these as a newborn and still loves them now at 11m.  We love them because they are one, molded piece - so no worrying about the pacifier end popping off and they are really easy to clean."
"And mom does too! This helps hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth, or at least close enough to it that he can get the paci back in on his own. It has just enough wait to help hold the pacifier in place, but not so much that it disrupts the baby. It's also something that the baby clearly loves to hold onto! Just wish there were more animal choices and that these were a little bit easier to find in stores. The one downside is that they're a little hard to clean without getting the animal attached soaked, but that's such a small point that it doesn't take away from how wonderful these things are!"
"So nice and small, soft and great for little hands. Will see how it holds up in a few months."
The website was very user friendly and the wubbanub was a perfect gift! Product was what the picture had shown and described.  Very happy with my purchase and the gift was a great success!
"We're on our 5th and 6th of these, and I wished I'd just bought a bunch at a sale vs. replacing them as they get lost.  These are totally worth having multiples of:  ones for the stroller, the crib, the play area, etc.  They also clean easily in the washer and dryer.  It was great to see the twins practice grasping with these and navigating the pacis to their mouths on their own.  At a year old, the twins now fight over them if only one is present.  The prices totally fluctuate, so shop around.  You could make your own, but if you're short on time (and already exhaused!) these are a life saver."
"I love it, everyone in the family loves it, my friends all love it. It's holding up well - made with quality materials. Too funny."
"little back up passies. Got them for my brothers new child, and he was very happy to put them to use."
"I thought paying over $10 for a pacifier was ridiculous, but Wubbanubs are worth every penny. They help keep the pacifier in place, and my son loves playing with the stuffed animal portion. I believe it helps with his motor skills. The only downside is that my dog thinks it's his chew toy, ha! That is obviously not a fault of the product, though. Good thing it's easy to wash and dry. :) We also have the giraffe and alligator wubbanubs. I think the animals with the longer legs (the giraffe and longhorn) stay in place a bit better because their feet are weighted a bit more, but we love all of them."
"My child loved these and they didn't interfere with breastfeeding at all due to the natural shape.  If you are going to do a binky, this is a great first pacifier.  We had such success with them, that I've bought many for other baby showers since then."

Super cute and very convinient.  Hard to lose. My two month old  baby loves it . He loves to play with the dinosaur while he is sucking on the pacifier.  Sometimes he falls asleep holding it.  I love it!!
Cool gift.Bought for a shower gift for my son.He will love it! Cant wait for him to see it.Funny! Baby will look great!
This is so adorable and my niece absolutely loves it. We had to buy her two since she prefers them to other pacifiers.
Easy to clean. Easy to use. The quality of this product was above my expectations. And the most important thing: my baby likes it.
The smoothie pacifier was priced right and very similar to the ones given at the hospital which Baby really loves.
"i bought this pacifier because we spent $10-15 on smoothies in the first two weeks of daycares.  Mutliple babies had the same smoothie, and we never got ours back.  Traditional smoothies are hard to label and hard to catch from being dropped.  These little animals fix all those problems.  We just throught the elephant (smoothie and all) into the washing machine once a week.  I was reluctant to pay this kind of money for a pacifier but it is one of our favorite baby products, and it is most definately the baby's favorite product!  She holds on to it and can find it at night if she looses it!  You could make your own by just sewing a small something to the end of the pacifier but this is the perfect size.  Plus everyone comments on how adorable it is.  We also have the giraffe. personally, i prefer the giraffe."
just like the soothie you get in the hospital but great unique color! love it! Serems strong and durable and long lasting!
"These work absolutely wonderful.  My newborn daughter likes to launch hers and somehow get them to land under her bed.  They stay glowing for really long periods of time, which makes them much easier to locate at 2am when she loses hers.  They are the best!!!"
We live in New Zealand and can't buy this product.<br /><br />I look after babies straight from hospital until they are placed for adoption. They have these pacifiers in the hospital but are unavailable anywhere else. They are a wonderful product and will buy more at a later date.
"My son loves these pacifiers, wont use any other... Great to have the stuffed animal on the end for them to hold or play with"
Our baby loves the NUK pacifiers.  These are no exception and they are my favorites because they are SO CUTE in the baby's mouth!
this little pod matches the bag well and does what is expected of it.  nice to have a pacifier handy when needed.
I bought these for my 4 month old daughter and they have quickly become her favorite and now ONLY pacifiers she will use. Great quality and easy to clean/sterilize.
I love these pacifiers! Both of my boys have used them and I have been very pleased. The glow in the dark feature is very nice for tracking them down in the dark. I will continue to use this. Brand until my boys outgrow them. They hold up very well and are worth every penny.
These are great and can be used upside down as well (which I was concerned about when I ordered) though we try not to sport our Cards upside down!
they are funny looking teeth that i can add to baby gifts for the next 5 babies born (5 pair). Only issue is they are not indifidually wrapped and probably should be since they are to put in a little baby mouth.  These days clean is pretty at issue.
I've heard great things about these pacifiers. I bought 6 for my cousin's first baby. The come in 3 packages of 2 each.
I love the Wubanub line of binkies! They are so cute and great for helping my little one learn to grab things and they are easy for me to grab too when she drops it. I have a couple of these now and will probably be getting more.
"My baby doesn't like pacifiers, my dog hates all dog toys. My baby LOVES these. My dog ate one and loved it. So yeah, totally worth the 5 stars :)"
"very helpful in between feeding , colors very appealing for our little one, proper shape and satisfying to baby. thanks"
"I use the small bag for liners that wash separate from cloth when we are out and about. I can also use it to dispose wipes if a trash is not nearby when I change baby, it is very small. The larger bag is adorable, and fit 4 diapers at least with room. Nice quality, and good price."
"I was concerned that my 4.5 month old wouldn't like the Soothie pacifier part of the WubbaNub since she hadn't used one, but she likes it as much as her GumDrop pacifiers. She LOVES this paci because it's easier to hold and keep in her mouth. It's the only paci I've ever seen her able to put back in her mouth if it falls out (she has done that 5 times that we know of!) I love the WubbaNub because she looks so darn cute kneading the little kitty as she is sucking the paci."
"I wasn't sure what to expect when purchasing these, but they are absolutely fabulous! No more feeling like you're putting chemicals into your child's mouth. I also love how easy they are to wash! The little loop on the end is also quite hady, especially when you're out and about and baby doesn't want the pacifier. Ours have gotten a little darker with time, but they still look as new otherwise. I can't say enough about these! I felt so confident using these and will recommend them to anyone - especially breast feeding mothers as I think these resemble a mother's nipple more than any other ones I've seen! Great product - worth the cost!"
"I like these pacifiers because they allow more room between my son's chin and his pacifier, so he doesn't end up with chapped skin."
I got it for my friends baby as a silly gift. They loved it! Not cheap and the baby seems comfortable with it
they are adorable.  much more appealing to the onlooker than the traditional plain ones.  just the right size for an infant too.
"Now that child #2 is here, we realize the importance of a pacifier. We've used several different brands, but always came back to Nuk. These just seem to fit for us, and can be found in pretty much every brick & mortar if you are in an emergency. Enjoy the sports theme, essentially 2 pacifiers for each season. Your kid will look cool in his NFL onesie and football pacifier."
This is our second of this one so we have it for home and daycare. My daughter never took a paci but she liked to hold the lamb and now that she's teething she chews on the pacifier.  It's her favorite toy.
"My son is still using them as teethers...they soothed him when he needed it. He just didn't use them for long..as I said earlier, they are not being used by him as teethers. They are bright and attract him easily and are hard enough that he feels good about chomping on them."
Bought these for my little one and when we brought her home from the hospital I tried giving her this binkie but she spit it out so we continued to use the Avent Soothie. Now that she's 1month old I tried giving her this binkie and she loves it.<br />I like the fact that it doesn't come out her mouth so easily and the hard plastic around it doesn't hug her mouth like others leaving marks.<br />Also they each come with their own protector case.
i was afraid of getting this because of comments about chemical smells. there was no chemical spell. it had a slight new plastic smell but nothing crazy. it makes the pnp a lot more comfortable and she now sleeps in it all night. :) so this was kind a life saver.
i am in love with this bedding system. i have had it for almost a year now and i'm still really impressed with the quality and its effectiveness. great ventilation for my little one :)
"my daughter is having her first baby and everybody recommended this item. the baby will be born in oct but, in the meantime, it seems great."
another great lamaze toy that i have hanging on my grandsons play mat that makes different noises and has different textures.  he likes to hear the crumpling sound of it.
bought these spoons because they are great for feeding my grandson.  they are softer so they don't hurt his mouth.
"my daughter is 2, she saw this and knew what to do it right away. she moves it to either one of our sinks and asks me to start the water for her. it stays steady in place (even with her on her tip toes) and it is easy to wipe clean. it is also cute, if i leave it outside the small bathroom it is fine, it does not look like misplaced clutter."
"i love how light weight this is.  and so many compartments to organize your stuff.  i use one of their smaller bags that comes with the bag as my wallet or clutch...i've over-used it to the point that the loop on the side broke off at the seams.  either way, it's great to grab and go if you're just dropping off the bag with a care-taker or throwing it back in and not carrying too many bags around when all you need is the diaper bag with your necessities in a smaller pouch.  love the insulated bag too.  keep all my ready to go formula bottles and nipples in there.  outside side pockets great for sanitizers, front pockets great for quick easy to reach and find wipes (hand and face wipes, pacifier wipes, and dry kleenex tissues).  other front pocket for my sunglasses, keys and phone.  my husband thinks i'm crazy for carrying a heavy bag, but i think it's already light weight to begin with so all the stuff i'm packing in are the items &#34;necessary&#34; to the added weight.  like water bottles for those powder formulas as my back up feedings (that's in one of the inside side mesh pockets).  extra change of clothes, extra mesh pockets for diapers and bibs and burp cloths.  the inside is so roomy, you can pack a loose blanket and toy blanket and other toys in there.  definitely a great deal for the price below $100.  would definitely recommend if you're like me into organizing and carry every essential item for your baby."
when i have my first grandchild come and visit i have this to place him in.  i love how easy it was to &#34;put together&#34;.  i would recommend this playard to all who would like a safe environment for their child/grandchild.
"my two toddlers had been getting into everything, so i bought these in hopes of saving my sanity. and they worked! easy to install, easy to use, and totally toddler proof."
"these have been the most leak-proof cup i have found. you must make sure the valve is fully pushed in though. a little difficult to use as a first sippy cup though, because you have to drink pretty hard to get the liquid to come out."
"i got tired of the poor quality ingredients in over priced squeeze pouches, but loved the convenience of being able to pass my busy 18 month old something nutritious that he could feed himslef. but what i really wanted was to use food i made... and found these. now after i make my smoothie in the morning i poor some into one of these for him and pass it along to him to eat while i finish getting ready. yeh!  i can even hide green ingredients in here without him suspecting.  they will leak if he throws it on the floor from his highchair, but can't blame the product.  much easier to wash than i would have guessed.  best baby find of the year."
easy to put up<br />easy to use<br />looks great<br />just what i was looking for<br />opens both ways which is a great addtion
"i used this daily as a safe place for my child to play for a few minutes while i get ready because it is small enough to fit in my bedroom, but roomy enough for a child to maneuver around.  we have also taken it on trips and found it extremely helpful as a safe, clean place to crawl around and burn off energy in airports, etc.  it is very easy to set up and take down quickly, and the bag is small/light enough to carry for a while.<br /><br />cons: (these aren't enough for me to take away a star, but they may be important to others)<br />- carrying: the bad only has fabric handles to carry the crib.  it would be better if the handles were padded, or if there was a shoulder strap.<br />- size: this is larger than standard carry-on size, so expect to hand it over at the gate like you would a stroller.  we had no trouble getting it on and off the plane un-damaged, but if we did it frequently, i would expect to see something scuffs or bending."
this bottle i keep at my house for my grand daughter.  she loves drinking her milk from it. her little hands go around it perfectly
"these cups are very cute and easy for our child to use.  the handles are easy for small hands, and the large silicone top is easy to drink from.  when my child is teething, i use these cups with cool water to help with the discomfort."
"i ordered the basket shelf storage cubby with three baskets in espresso, along with the three bin storage cubby, for my toddler's room (to replace a set of six cubes she pulled down on top of herself--oops!).  these are sturdy, roomy, and look adorable in her room.  the reviews complaining about the quality and color of the \\wood\\ should have more reasonable expectations...you don't pay ikea prices to get pottery barn quality.  for the price paid, these are great quality, came well-packaged, were super easy to assemble (i assembled both pieces by myself within an hour) and do the job of storing books and toys in a kids' room.  and it looks great to boot!"
we just had our second child and we wanted a monitor that had good video quality that didn't cost too much. we got this monitor with an additional camera for under $170 with shipping and it's a great deal. it switches between the cameras without any lag or delay and the range is very far. our older boy has a lot of plush toys in his crib and the night vision has no problem in seeing everything clearly although it goes into a black and white mode. the monitor does not warn you before it goes out of battery but this isn't a problem because we have the power cord plugged in unless we are moving it from room to room. overall this is a great monitor at a great price.
i bought this to put on my sons crib mattress when he switched to a toddle bed. it adds just the right amount of softness to a very firm mattress. he says his bed is nice and cozy now so that's worth 5 stars to me.
I bought this lamp for my son's forest theme nursery.  It fits right in.  It is good quality and the colors look the same as in the picture.  It came with a light bulb which was a nice plus.  Long cord with switch.  Very happy with the purchase.
My daughter really likes this. I was afraid it would be heavy but she is able to keep it in her mouth well and she holds onto the toy. It's really cute. She is 9 weeks old and it is a lifesaver when she wants to nurse but it isn't time.
We got some great pictures with this pacifier.  My son enjoys sucking on it.  you can sterilize in boiling water which is great. It is very sturdy - my son likes to chew on the outside of pacifiers too and this one has held up.
"Super cute! However, I thought I would be getting yellow and they sent me blue but I dont care becuase the blue ones are just as cute!"
I bought this as a gift for my friend. When she asked me to look for a binky with a mustash i looked at her like she was crazy. When i recieved the package I LOVED it. Its so cute and i just hope her little one will love it. :)
my daughter loves this she would only take this one she loved that she could hold it also its great for busy moms that cant keep putting in in and out of there mouth they love it bc they can hold it with there little hand and its soft to the only thing i could never figure out how to wash the caterpiller its self tho.
"Love these wipes & love that there's more than 36 in a pack. My in laws keep the baby while I'm at work & they tend to use several in a day. Haven't run out yet & it's been at least a month since they arrived & we've hardly used any at all, so it seems."
"Perfect solution to finding a pacifier in the middle of the night.  I started putting it into the crib with my then 8 month old.  He didn't really pick up that it had a pacifier on it for a good 2 weeks or so.  Now it stays in the crib and when he wakes in the night for his paci, he knows to grab the bear.  Perfect solution."
"This is one of those baby products that you use EVERYDAY! This is our 3rd wubbanub and my 6 month old loves it. It has different textures that he loves to feel and when he is not sucking on the pacifier, he is chewing on the monkey's legs. We LOVE wubbanubs-this one is just adorable."
i've had this before. works well on a smooth surface. gives me balance control when my eyes are shut. no good for  holding you up. it's not meant for that. a good way to find out where to put a permanent one.
my grand-daughter is able to move and jump much more freely than in another one she has access to and uses at another home and will be happy in the rain-forest for long period of time (1 hr). i would recommend this to everyone.  i just think the fisher-price rainforest jumperoo should be available in local stores as well as on-line.
"a good size, my daughter (age 6) loves it. i think the only thing i don't particularly like is that the pocket flap doesn't always lay flat, closed. but that criticism is being picky, i think. got here quickly, as expected."
view all descriptions and evaluate as to your needs.  when using as a gift . it is easy to gift wrap
"i put this fence up and take it down easily.  when toddlers are in the house or when the pets need to be contained.  it's easy to use, it's effective, and it doesn't damage the wall.  the cat can pass through it, which for me, is a bonus. it opens easily with an option to click the latch into a locked position if needed. just slide the &#34;lock&#34; back, and lift the latch to open the gate, this can be done with one hand."
"the title really says the description...easy simply basic shelf.  i suggest adding some vaseline to the suction cup (and applying it to a completely dry surface) when first \\installing\\ this (and that will basically be your install) - that way you can say with decent certainty that it's not going anywhere for quite some time.<br /><br />one thing it doesn't handle too well are the large pump-style bottles (something like a 32oz bottle) - they tend to just slide around on it & can't seem to find a good spot to hold their weight...but otherwise it works great.  it can hold the weight, it's more of the bottle not resting stably enough for you to use the hand pump.<br /><br />this is designed really only for bathtubs & is not designed to be a raised shelf. there is one suction cup on the bottom (the blue dot you see in the image - that's the top of the suction cup) - it basically just rests on the sides of the tub & the suction cup keeps it in place.<br /><br />not sure why this is an oxo tot item (tot being their toddler/baby line of products) - since it's definitely useful for any bathtub that needs a shelf - i don't see any reason why this is especially useful for those bathing their kids (except maybe the versatility of the front cutout) - but i guess they needed to categorize it somewhere in their line of products."
"i've tried several cloth training pants (after using cloth diapers) and these are hands down my favorite.  they are super comfortable for my toddler and not very bulky but still catch her accidents.  even when she has a big accident it mostly contains so i only have to clean her and (possibly) her clothes, not the floor or whatever was underneath her.  i love the designs they come in too.  i think their fit is very accurate and wish more parents would use re-usable products with their children."
holds our toys great and allows for them to dry completely! a great buy and a must for toys that need to air dry.
as far as i can tell this is very well made.  it fits perfectly and is very comfortable to use in the car.  i am a short adult who needs this adjuster in order to be comfortable in the seat belt.
"my 4 week old grandson loves this toy...the music, the lights, the bright colors really gets his attention, and soothes him.  highly recommend."
i recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought it is as expected buy a recomend them
i got pink foot. and my lo is good with it. he doesn't have problem to grab it. i guess i can say my lo satisfied with this purchase :)
"it's very safe and nice my son enjoy this walker, it is very safe, we can live him right all over the house, i have steps from to room is almost 1 feet high every time he drives there the breaks stop hem, very safe."
really cute for adding little suzy's zoo to your baby collection of things. will order more as needed to then.
this is a great watch it reminded my daughter to go potty all on her own. only down side is they really should make it water proof
"everything about this cart cover is very good, except that it is a bit bulky, which i knew it would be but it would be better if they had made it just half as bulky, but then it probably wouldn't be as comfortable.  the elmo part doesn't really excite my 8 month old but it is very cute. i don't like all the other ones out there with a bunch of patterns on it, like some grandma's curtains."
i bought this for my niece and fits perfectly with her pretty in purple bedroom theme. the quality is soft yet sturdy and has survived many washes without color fading.
my granddaughter is finally able to sleep more than 15 minutes because of the slight incline. thank goodness!! try it soon!!
"i use this as a second car seat and take it on travel. it is light, easy to install and comfortable. my 22 mth old daughter loves sitting in it. highly recommend it."
"even if you aren't cloth diapering, or you're using a different system (we're using gdiapers), a good stash of prefolds is an absolute must. we use them as burp cloths, bibs, napkins, makeshift changing pads, pillows, blankets, emergency diapers for the occasional \\oops\\ on the changing table -- you name it. it's our all-purpose, go-to rag for baby goo of all kinds.<br /><br />these bumkins premium prefolds quilted up nicely in the wash and are super soft and absorbent. this is the size you want for a multi-purpose burp cloth, as i find the infant size too small to be effective. we have two dozen, and that's a good stash if you don't plan to use them as diapers. double that if you do!<br /><br />update: the dimensions of these are 14.5\\ x 22\\ before washing. after several washes, they shrink to about 12\\ x 18\\, with a bit of variation depending on how much they quilt up. we bought another dozen, and are using them to stuff our gdiapers for overnight. still love these!"
"our orbit baby is fantastic!  we had decided on this system before seeing the price (probably a bad idea) - but we don't regret it.<br /><br />our daughter is 4 months old now and really enjoys the stroller seat, hence our need for the large weather pack (we already had the small weather pack for the infant car seat- we keep it in the car so we're always prepared while we're out).  the rain cover is thick and substantial but doesn't smell like cheap plastic like most of the other covers i've seen other people use.  both the rain cover and bug shield are easy to put on and fit like a glove.  and they each have features that make it easy to dock/un-dock the seat from the base without removing them.<br /><br />we've used the small weather pack for the past 4 months on a daily basis and usually twice a day; both the rain cover and bug shield are holding up well."
i am a mom of 4 and a child care provider and i am so pleased with this chair!  it is portable and very easy to set up.  i wish i had had this with my first 3 children.  well worth the money.
love the clear bag really easy to find all ur junk!great for outdoors and the beach will get another one
"i pump almost on a daily basis to keep a back-up supply in the fridge/freezer.  this pump is easy to use and fits well.  it is easy to get the right motion going and is never too powerful.  i haven't used any other pumps so i don't really know how others work but this one is great.  i don't think i could manage a double-pump, this one allows me to pump while i drink coffee or surf the web which makes the time pass quickly."
made the expense of the stroller much more worthwhile since we can turn it into a bassinet by our bed.  easy to fold down and use for travel.  very sturdy and doesn't take up much space.  can store baby items on the bottom shelf.
love these bottles and they are so easy to use! love the filtration system in the bottles to keep the air from going into the babies tummy.
"shopping for my daughter's baby was easy! having knowledge of what first time moms really need vs. what is just unnecessary noise/static/fiscal waste proved indispensable. this graco totbloc pack n play is a mom's helper and it is perfectly coloured.  the primary colours and close netting sides are a must for newborns up until ~ 15 months (give or take; depending on how tall your child gets).  it provides a safe environment for your child while you are (within eye-sight) doing those things that need to be done.  of course, your child must never be left unsupervised, but this play yard functions as a temporary sanctuary. it is roomy and comes with everything that you need in a playpen: colour, sturdy see through sides, playpen floor padding, and a carry bag to keep it clean and portable!<br />while it is a very sturdy play yard, it is portable. while it is portable, it is somewhat heavy; this is because it is sturdy and reasonably substantial.  this is not the sort of play yard that is light weight for extremely short/temporary use; and that is why i chose it for my daughter's baby.  i found playpens indispensable as a first time mom and as a second time around mom as well!  as your baby grows, this graco totbloc play yard will be able to house favorite toys, etc. to keep baby occupied while you do necessary things (always within eye-sight/supervision; never leaving your child unattended!): such as work @ home (or in your office [if you are fortunate enough to work in that sort of company]); doing household necessities; sitting outside relaxing with a good book while baby takes a nap outside with you; etc.<br />i looked at quite a few playpens before picking this one.  the price point was excellent.  the colour was perfect because it will positively stimulate babies of various stages.  it was the perfect size (not too small, not too rectangular).  although a bit heavy, this playpen is portable.  it came with everything that is needed for a playpen (many do not come with a floor cover pad, etc.).  it has a carrying case/bag for better storage and portability.  the graco totbloc pack 'n play with carry bag offers almost everything needed in a playpen.<br />the only thing is that the bars on the top of this play yard are covered but not padded.  if there were padding on the bars, this playpen would be absolutely flawless; and deserving of 5 stars.<br />graco totbloc pack 'n play is a great product, at a great price from amazon.com!ith a floor cover pad, etc.).  it has a carrying case/bag for better storage and portability.  the graco totbloc pack 'n play with carry bag offers almost everything needed in a playpen.<br />the only thing is that the bars on the top of this play yard are covered but not padded.  if there were padding on the bars, this playpen would be absolutely flawless; and deserving of 5 stars.<br />graco totbloc pack 'n play is a great product, at a great price from amazon.com!"
"i've given this as a gift and have one for myself. it lasts for years, versus a cute onesie as a shower gift. the recipient is always amazed at the thoughtfulness and usefulness of the gift. a great, gender-neutral, outside-the-box gift. it's nicely boxed for wrapping too! couldn't be happier."
"made mom and my life alot easier, kept baby in a safe position he could not roll off, save on our back as we did not have to bent over."
"this is a great case, well made. you will not be disappointed with this case, i guarantee it... great value!"
as a first time mommy i could not of asked for a better monitor! it allows me to do housework without having to run into the nursery every two mixtures.  we have been using it for a little over a week and not had one false alarm. our son's bassinet has a vibration option to help him sleep and we thought the monitor wouldn't work when the vibration was on since the bassinet was vibrating but my husband forgot to put the monitor on hold before picking our son up when the bassinet was vibrating and the monitor still sounded the alarm when it didn't detect our son breathing! i love this monitor!!!! it's a most have for any mom or dad!!!
i felt better having this faucet cover installed when my daughter started to stand up in the tub. super easy to install.
"this item was a necessary purchase with all of the other similar items i was needing for my new grandson's crib.  although the price was almost comparable to a new purchase retail, i ordered several similar needed items all at the same time to avoid &#34;shopping around&#34; town.  pad is soft, good quality & shipping was fast.  totally satisfied"
"we were having a hard time getting our daughter to take a bath...we had tons of bath toys, but i purchased these and bathtime is fun again! she loves them and she wants to take a bath now! a great purchase and i would highly recommend buying a bath tub toy bag to store them in...once we put them in the bag they dry off by themselves and i don't have to worry about them getting dry. a great purchase."
"i took a gamble with bob car seat adapter for britax because bob doesn't make an adapter for baby trend car seat (i specifically have a flex-loc baby trend).  i couldn't even find anywhere on the internet that had a solution for this (other than buying a graco).  i love our baby trend car seat and already had it from our first child.  i didn't want to purchase something else.<br /><br />i tried some of the adapters at toys 'r' us and none of them worked.  i tried the graco, peg perego, and even the britax with a baby trend car seat.  none of them worked.  the baby trend car seat wouldn't attach at all to the graco or the peg perego adapters.  on the britax adapter, the baby trend could sit on it but didn't snap in and any weight on the front of the car seat would flip it right off.<br /><br />after searching long and hard on the internet without finding any solutions (other than buying a different car seat).  i found the britax infant carrier to stroller adapter strap.  it is super simple!  just a strap, a buckle and some d-rings.  wrap the straps around the metal pins in the britax car seat adapter and the straps can buckle the baby trend car seat in securely!  it's perfect!  very secure.<br /><br />i do have one confession.  the baby to go in this isn't born yet.  i will update this review once i have some time with the baby in it.  though, i don't see many issues.<br /><br />good luck!"
"exactly what i needed, at a better price than buying medela brand. same quality, works perfectly. amazon comes though again!"
"i'd been hunting for crib mattresses for my new grandson for some time in the paper, 2nd hand stores etc. but it was hard to find one practically priced for &#34;used&#34;.  when i went on line to amazon, i was impressed with the price for a &#34;new&#34; crib mattress compared to retail purchased new.  it came within days, well packaged... i am totally satisfied with this purchase."
bought this to go with out monkey themed nursery. it does as stated.<br /><br />i like that you can change the color. it stays cool to the touch.<br /><br />i plan to hook this up to a timer in the future once our son becomes a toddler as an alarm clock. placing it on a timer outlet to turn off at a certain time to teach him not to come out of the room until the light turns off. heard its better then teaching them how to tell time.
"i started w newborn guava mitts.  they were big the first two months.  but after the 3rd month, it fit so nicely.  i purchased more in a large size."
easy and cheap and practical. you can't go wrong with these. have definitely  recommended these to my friends. thanks again britax!
"great for attaching toys, snack cups, and sip pies to highchairs, jumperoos, and strollers.  use your imagination, i have several of these and love them."
"most useful toy around the house, car... my baby loves it so much! bright colors, easy to assemble to anything. i even removed original toy from his bouncer and put this one, because he really loves it"
this product made it possible for us to put our four-year-old granddaughter in a large queen size bed.  she loves it!
"we have a motorhome with cabinets that could open while traveling over some of the rough highways in america. this product will be a great solution to secure the cabinet doors, easy to install and remove, and look great.<br />thanks for the solution to my problem"
"these decals are so great. pretty colors and textures, they're a lot of fun to look at and walk the line nicely between realism, art, and cheerfulness. they aren't cartoony, which i really appreciate. i wish there was also a digger, but this set is pretty great for my vehicle-obsessed three year old. easy to install, and still stuck tight three months later. we also got the set with planes, helicopters, hot air balloons and a blimp, love that one too.  -- updating after 2 years: these are still on the wall more than two years later. i love them, and they have grown up really well from age 3.5 to 5.5."
"the microphone windscreens were as good as expected for the price. they fit my microphones which are sure mic's without any hassle of tearing when being applied. the fit is a snug fit which is important for proper use. i would recommend buying this product highly. however, if you're lacking in patients, the delivery is slow. this product is being shipped on a slow boat from overseas so don't expect a fast and timely delivery. if you pay for expedited shipping then the cost savings is out the window. order before you need them and this way your money will be well worth it...<br />bottom line, yes i would recommend this product.<br /><br />t wright"
"i love this sheet/pad for my play yard.  when it came out of the wrapper i thought i had made a mistake and that it was too small, but it fits well, pads the mattress so that my granddaughter sleeps all night and i know that if she has an accident i can just pull it off and keep going."
has held up great through the wash. i was concerned with the ties as others had complained but it came with 5 ties that are well spaced out. they are very sturdy and keep the pad in place. unfortunately my daughter had already gotten so many teeth marks in her crib so i really wish we had bought this sooner! it has actually made her stop chewing on it all together as she doesn't like the fleece in her mouth. very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone with a baby.
"we bought these little guys and i love to squirt my son with these at bath-time. they're colorful, durable, and fun. half the time he's gnawing on them; it's easy to wash his hair while he's occupied."
my daughter is six months old and she can even pick up this ball thanks due the design.  it is heavy duty and a great product.
i bought this for my nephew for the zoo and some other public events and it definately got put to good use!
"the wearable blanket is very nice, the fabric is cotton and breathable, my baby is very confortable while sleeping inside."
this cute butterfly is sturdy and colorful and the perfect compliment to tie back curtains.  i have a tangled theme in my granddaughter's room.  i used purple sheer curtains and tied them back with this butterfly.  i used the &#34;command&#34; brand damage-free hanging hooks to keep the curtains and butterfly pulled back to the edge of the wall. i highly recommend this product.
i love it that i can get what i wanted from my daughter. i have prime and got it sooner than i was told. my daughter loves it!
"this diaper is affordable and excellent. it doesn't leak, is easy to clean, and dries quickly. a month ago i ordered a variety of cloth diapers and this one is my favorite. i have ordered 8 more alva baby diapers. also my baby is a very slender baby. i was concerned about ordering a one size for her because she was so small, but it didn't leak and is growing with her."
"this \\jesus loves me musical baby plush lamb\\ is a heart-warming and a most precious gift. the lamb is well made, is soft and cuddly and is truly a wonderful gift with eternal significance. i would highly recommend this gift for a little child.  as scripture says, \\train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\\ proverbs 22:6."
i can put my baby in the shopping cart and high chair when i go shopping or go to eat in the restaurant.
so handy.  i bought two for a shower gift and the new mom uses them all the time.  you always know where the binky is and it stays clean.  very good idea.
"my 16 month old daughter loves the monkey, but loves her buttercup doll (same brand) even more.  the monkey is a little large for her right now but the arms and legs make it easy for her to carry it around."
great product love it! buy a little more then you think you need doesn't come with much. my daughter loves it!
"these are good bottle labels. they are easy to write on with different types of pens, and peel off easily without leaving any sticky residue behind. i bough enough to hopefully last through two babies. i received some as a shower gift, and when i went to purchase more, could only find them on amazon."
i bought the one that amazon said had cosmetic damage to it. i'll be buying anything amazon says has cosmetic damage. it looked brand new you couldn't tell there was anything wrong with it. my husband and i really liked that it had a built in screen so we can take it outside.  i'm sure our new little will enjoy it.
"easy to clean, small and compact.  easy for my small 2 year old to sit on it.  only 2 pieces to keep clean"
i use the photo album for flash card for my son and picture that he will know. i love the photo album. i bought a perfect album for my son.
"overall, this charger has worked great. if you're like me, and need a large number of 9v batteries ready to go at a moments notice, you can't go wrong with this charger."
"i had received a few different types of changing pads as shower gifts and these are the best!  they still look great after many washes, unlike others that look ratted and old.  i also like that they don't feel plastic like at all.  they fit the standard changing pad great!  i used to carry one around in my diaper bag for on the go changes too."
this thing is freakin awesome to maneuver and it was assembled within 25 minutes. i really liked the whole paris eiffel tower theme on this stroller. very unique design.
this product is great note 100 i loved this purchase and recommend everyone do not go up arepender the quaidade and spectacular.i loved that car here in brazil all appreciate
very sturdy  i love it  easy to use  easy to put my baby in and out<br />would recommend this product
the snack tray is  very cool. 8 year old grandson loved it!  it worked really well for our 10 month old granddaughter!
used it for my first daughter and now the second one also loves it. goes to sleep right away as soon as rocking starts.
"i have a 15 month old, who loves to be outside.  so i was looking for a hat to protect her precious head, ears, face, and neck.  i saw this hat and felt like after reading the reviews that it would be perfect.  i was also happy with the sale price of $20.  my daughter will not keep anything on her head, so i was happy this came with a strap that would tighten around her neck.  when i first put the hat on, i did not put the strap on tight enough and she pulled it right off her head.  so i had daddy try again and she has not taken it off since.  i can even now just put on the hat without tightening the strap and sometimes she will ask for her hat before going out the door.  great buy for my daughter!"
"holds bottles of all sizes, has straps for extra support, it's great all around and i really truly love it. get this bra. you wont regret it"
was durable and exactly what i wanted as it was a shower gift and fit the motif for the new baby's room.
thx i like the stuff that i just ordered it was perfect with good quality n the service was amazing n it arrived at the exactly time thx a lot
"of course, there were good and bad reviews for this gate but i thought i would give it a try and i am not sorry.  it arrived well packed and was easily assembled as the instructions were clearly written.  the gate actually comes in 2 main pieces.  the main section and an extension for wider doorways.  i did not use the extension.<br /><br />the instructions said to mount the gate 3 inches off the floor but i didn't want it that high so i used the flat side of a 2 by 4 to rest it on while installing it, making the height about 1 1/2 inches off the floor.  it worked perfectly.  the gate is all metal except for a few small parts.  when the gate is open, i'm sure it is wide enough for anyone to get thru.  so, i give it 5 stars and would recommend this gate to anyone."
it comes with all these bags that are labeled to keep everyone organized. plus a blanket and pillow. i love this for the daycare to use
my little girl kept biting holes in her sippy cup nipples.  these fit perfectly and even worked on other sippy cup brands.  i know where to get more!
granddaughter loves it. sleeps well on it and fits perfectly in the pack and play. recommend this to all looking for a mattress for their pack and play
"baby loves it.  too small for my toddler's helmet head, but perfect fr the nine month old.<br />my frost time buying this type of product and t was well worth the money."
the podee handsfree feeding system gives your baby confidence and a sense of security as often occurs with leaving them at daycare and nurseries. it provides your baby with the ability to feed itself whenever baby desires. it's as simple as handling a lightweight \\pacifier\\ connected to a tube carrying formula or breast milk. great for fussy babies in the middle of the night. this is the only system i used.
"we travel internationally 2-3x a year and this bag has survived all of our flights. our son uses a recaro proride seat and although the fit is tight, it covers it well. just bought a second bag since we're expecting #2 soon"
my toddler loves this potty. he has been potty trained for almost a year now and we have not had a single accident in public. we carry this in the little bag it comes in inside his back pack. i am thrilled with this and am getting a second one. i am so thankful for this item!
these sheets fit great and are extremely soft!  i was lucky to have found them on line and priced rights.
"i purchased a second one of these guys because the little guy loved his first one to \\death\\.  wonderful.  his parents didn't think much of it when they first heard it, kind of freaked them out a little, but it quickly became one of his favorite toys!"
bought this item for my granddaughter.  her family were going camping for a week and it was perfect.  she loved sleeping in it.  they have taken it to hotels and this week heading to the beach.  my daughter has posted it on facebook as highly recommended to her friends.
i love this stroller!  it folds/unfolds easily.  it is big enough for my 2 years old who is currently 34&#34; tall and weighs about 33 pounds.  there is still plenty of room for his head as he keeps growing.  it must be comfortable b/c he naps in it all of the time when i shop and run errands.  i wish i would have order this months earlier!!!
"she's cool, really twirls to my expectations, arrived on time.  i didn't know they are inter changeable so i want to collect more and change them up."
"we've been shopping for a nice play area for our crawling and cruising baby. this is perfect! the colors are nice and bold, so it makes it fun. it doesn't look like an animal cage, compared to others. it has a nice little play panel with a phone dial, and other things for a baby or toddler to play with, including a mirror. the material is a high quality, thick, smooth plastic, so babies can't hurt themselves by touching or grabbing the rails. it's also not easy to climb, so it serves its purpose by keeping infants and small toddlers safe in a play area."
my new great grandson love's it. the heart beat sound put him to sleep at night.<br />the mother thinks it is the best!!!!!!
so this has served a couple of different purposes already!<br /><br />one - we used it at the hospital. with the nurses coming in and out through the night this made it easier without having to turn on the room lights and check on the baby.<br />two - our child is sleeping in the bassinet /play pen for the first few weeks in our room. its great to throw it into the corner of the play pen and check up on him without having to turn on the lights.<br />other intended uses- we plan to use this for traveling too. its small enough to take anywhere. i think its more permanent home will be by the changing pad to change him at night.<br /><br />pro's<br />- great battery life so far. lasts a full night.<br />- like the different colors. except maybe the red but green and blue are nice.<br />- cool to the touch.<br /><br />cons<br />- i wish the timer feature could be changed. then again i haven't looked back at the instructions to see if that is possible
"just the right size for my baby to hold, and i love that it converts to a toddler sippy cup. super fast shipping too."
nice lightweight fabric valance with large rod pocket. really liked that the design wasn't too infantile or juvenile. we are using it in a pediatric exam room.
thx i like the stuff that i just ordered it was perfect with good quality n the service was amazing n it arrived at the exactly time thx a lot
"baby had not slept in his crib until this monitor arrived.  from the first night, everyone including mommy has slept well, waking only when it's time to eat.  she loved the motion detection pad, which gave her added assurance that anything out of the ordinary would cause the alarm to sound."
perfect for chilly nights in the sf bay area. much softer than i expected. should work well for winter too as i'll dress him warmer before putting him in the sleeping bag.
"i ordered this product i believe it was on a saturday and received within days of my order! i was super impressed!  i love having the added securtiy of watching my (almost 1 year old) son when i can not be in the same room as he is.  our kitchen is off to the side so if i am making his meals or washing dishes, i couldn't see or hear him (if water was running).  now i feel so at ease if i have to step out of the room.  i have noticed that it really does interferre with my wireless internet but if i move it out of the way of the wireless &#34;range&#34;, it doesn't bother it and i will take the interenet compatibility issues knowing i can see that my son is safe.  i love that this specific camera very rarely gives a fuzzy picture and during the day or when there is light in the background, everything is in color!  i love this product and am very satisfied with it!!"
"i purchased this when my son was twelve weeks old, and he could already reach the toys. it is soft and padded and the hanging toys have different textures and noises to keep baby entertained. my favorite feature is that the gym folds up and zips closed for ultimate portability."
keeps the set cool.  easy to put on and take off to store.  the grandkids can take it off themselves.
"i bought this to monitor my mother who had alzeimers when she was bed ridden.<br />i only used it for 16 days so i cant state how long it would last,but it really helped me when i needed it."
not only did the father and mother to be love them. all the guests did as well. they were even more attractive than the pictures. close though. i would by them again for someone else. thanks amazon for helping me purchase them on line.
really cute and easy to use. it's alittle heavy but that's from the weight inside holding the wides. other than that i love it
i was a bit skeptical when purchasing this crib skirt but i'm very glad i ordered it and made my own decision. the skirt is well sewn together and fits my crib perfectly. the fabric is pretty decent quality and does a great job of adding character to our baby's crib. so glad i ordered this finishing touch!
"great gate, for a great price! fits where a lot of gates wouldn't securely. might get a second one for our deck."
"this stroller is awesome for taller people. i am 5'9 and its nice to not have to hunch over to reach the handle to push it. the handles are at  nice height and it feel like it navigates really well. it doesn't get stuck on uneven concrete, it handles with ease. i don't have to worry about the front wheels getting stuck when im trying to push it after stopping. i chose this stroller for my 3.5 year old daughter whom complains of frequent leg pains (doctor says it's growing pains) she is about 40 inches and 33lbs and she fits nicely in this stroller. her feet don't dangle to the ground so, don't i have to make sure i'm not dragging them because she forgot to pick them up. she's doesn't look crumpled up in the stroller, she's able to sit up straight and comfortably. it also has a 5 pt harness. i initially disagreed with this idea when i bought it. i took my daughter shopping and remember how my daughter lies to reach out and mess with clothes or whatever she can reach now and again. guess who was happy for the 5 point harness after that :d the one down side but i'm okay with dealing with is, it's a bit heavier than the other smaller strollers.  i really think its a little heavier because this stroller is very supportive of heavier weight. i also like that there is a basket at the bottom, an umbrella, and an organizer by the handles. oh, the grip on the stroller is really nice as well. over all i don't regret purchasing this product and it was worth the extra $20, i was gonna just get a cheap $19.99 one. i think my child can use this one for at least another year or year and a half."
awesome product! medela is a great brand for pumps and pumping supplies. used these as backup shields for my pump and no problems or complaints whatsoever.
this is a great sun shade - and it is really needed for this stroller to keep the sun off the toddler riding in the back. good for keeping the kids dry in light rain showers too.
really worked great for camping and we plan on using it for all outdoor activities. even fits over the stroller.
i couldn't believe this product was as cheap as it said. i thought it would tear or be defective. it's a great product worth your money.
"Our son had no interested in any pacifier we tried to give him. My wife had used AVENT pacifiers with some of her daycare kids, so we decided to give them a try with our son. They were perfect for him and now e have purchased more for our soon to be daughter."
What a great gift these baby pacifiers have made.  I just had to have a few to send to my good friends.
im so glad these were available on amazon!!<br />they are the only ones that my kids take.  make naptime and bedtime so much easier!!
"My son (between birth and 1 year) and now my infant both had/have only used this brand.  I have tried others, but they only like this kind."
"My daughter kept spitting out her binky and would cry after a few moments without it.  The wubbanub helps the binky to stay in her mouth, and she loves cuddling with the little lamb.  Awesome product!"
"very good quality and it looks adorable. it would make a lovely gift, my son's pictures turned out so cute with this pacifier and the style is a little different ."
"Love these. Best paci. Every child is different so you have to find what works for them. My daughter was breastfeed so this shape being most like the breast worked for her, Iv tried the gumdrops by this brand which supposed to be the same but she wont touch them. I also got a different brand just like this and she spit them out. Babies know what they like."
"My daughter absolutely adores her wubbas and we cannot leave home w/out them!!  I always take a few for our car trips anywhere as they're soooo much easier to find and hand her, the paci's by themselves require pulling the car over, as well as hunting for them everywhere.  So happy to have found this product!!"
Bought this for my six month old and she loves it. She carries the turtle around as her favorite stuffed animal and when she's tired she pops the pacifier in her mouth and pets her turtle til she falls asleep. All other pacifiers don't compare. Worth every penny for the joy it brings my little girl and the quiet it brings mommy :-)
"Each baby is different, so I had to try many pacifiers to find some she liked.  Ultimately she liked the ones with the angled nipple.  I especially love that this came with a cover to keep it clean when I need to throw a spare in the diaper bag."
"Each baby is different, so I had to try many pacifiers to find some she liked.  Ultimately she liked the ones with the angled nipple."
How true it is!  A big hit as an extra little gift at a baby shower!  Gave everyone a laugh.  Plus it's useful!
"I love them , just what I expected, good quality for the price, can be used on any straw so no need to wash straws this is great"
"Our daughter will not go to sleep without it. I have bought three of them. This is because she pulls the pacifier off the elephant. Other than that, it is a great product."
"These are my baby's favorite pacifiers. They are good quality, good price, are super cute and come in a nice little case great for my diaper bag."
The picture doesn't do it justice. This is the cutest!  It has flowers on the belly. These are the best pacifiers because they stay in their mouth. These are a must have for new moms.
"Basically get one free when buying these through amazon, our baby wants nothing to do with most pacifiers except for this style, so we like to keep a bit of a stock pile and for this price it's not too bad"
I love these pacifiers. My daughter started using other pacifiers that would touch her cheeks. She had such sensitive skin that she would get rashes from them. So I thought I would try these and LOVED them. They stay off her cheeks and I loved that they would flex like a nipple. She loved them and they look really cute. The only problem is that you have to order them from online because they are not sold in stores anymore. I would order these again for my future kids.
"I bought this as a gift for my friend for her baby shower. As of yet, the baby has not been born, so I don't know how it is rated as a pacifier. But it is ADORABLE!!!!"
"I wish I knew about these 3 months ago! This helps keep the binky in his mouth. No more getting up 100 times a night to help him get it back in. Great product. We also bought an elephant, but the giraffe works way better. The elephant doesn't stay in as well. Great buy!!"
"I have retired all of our non-Wubbanub pacifiers since my son prefers these so much! They can get a little grungy from being chewed and drooled on, but I just send them through the washing machine. They are very good quality and look brand new when they come out."
I bought 3 for my baby boy and want them all now! It really helped him learn how to put his paci in his mouth and its so adorable when he cuddles with it! Recommend!!
"My grandson thinks it is the most wonderful thing in the world, and gets so excited to have it.  So, I love it!"
"When my baby wakes up hungry or need to change it and she cries a lot, this is the one that makes it easy."
This one is awesome ... helps big time with upset baby.. easy to keep in car or carriage and dont loose easy because of attachment
Great quality for the price! Every Red Sox fan with a baby should own these cute pacifiers! Would purchase again.
It's well-made and gets a ton of double-takes and compliments. My baby is always the hit of the party... and he has no idea why :-)
My daughter will not use any other pacifier.  They are durable and I love that they came in pink and purple.
"Avent really is a great Brand! Love the styles, everything I wanted! Great buy! The only thing I don't like is that you don't get to choose the styles"
Gift to expecting mother who is doing giraffe theme.  She loved it.  It was exactly what she wanted and was very pleased.
My little guy loves this pacifier very much.  It's nice because he had hang onto it too.  The ducky is super cute!
"got this as an additional baby shower gift for a friend. I, myself, love it. would def get my baby one when that time comes!"
"They are perfect for little hands to hold and when the kids have outgrown the pacifier, they can still play with the animals."
"My Godson love his WubbaNub Brown Puppy. He's just now learning how to hold his own bottle, hold things, and he is now interested in playing with toys. This is the perfect gift for babies who are just now starting to grab and hold things and if they are teething. My Godson never lets his WubbaNub Brown Puppy Go. Get one now!"
"We love this binky!  Our son loves the rounded tip, no nipple confusion and we dont have to worry about the quality of material he is putting in his mouth."
"Pros:<br />*Cute, I get comments from people all the time on how neat/cute it is<br />*Easier to find in moment of screaming baby panic than a traditional pacifier<br />*Stuffed animal makes it easier for baby to hold<br />*Ability to tuck stuffed animal into straps of car seat to keep in place for baby<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Pacifier doesn't attach, so you must wash the whole thing or wash just the pacifier part very carefully."
"We were losing binkies left and right, and they were the best way for my little girl to fall asleep. Cue this reasonably-priced 6-pack of her favorite style! They are very much like the green ones she was given while in the NICU, just a little bit thicker (being the 4+ month version). She doesn't seem to show any favoritism between the green newborn ones and these pink 4+ month-ers."
Would recommend to anyone!  Keeps the pacifier from instantly landing on the floor and bouncing around when baby lets go.  My baby is also able to get it back in her mouth sometimes on own!  Great product!  Only complaint is that it's harder to clean (obviously) than usual pacifier.
My daughter loves her Buddy as she calls it! We never leave home without him! This is actually one I bought For my second daughter because my first loves hers so much! She had seen my daughter's and asked about it for her newborn. I highly recommend these! They're cute and pretty easy to keep up with! My daughter likes to rub hers as she falls asleep.

We purchased more for a filler for a zebra themed diaper cake and recipient loved it so much.  Super cute and fun.
I BOUGHT THIS PACIFIER FOR LOVELT DAUGHTER IT WORKS AND IS A GREAT PACIFIER FOR ANYONE WITH A NEW BABY.
My grandson lost his &#34;monkey&#34; and we needed to get one fast as the stores were sold out.  He loves &#34;monkey&#34; because he can hold onto it while he uses the pacifier. Great idea.
"I am very pleased with this sweet little binky buddy, and so is my baby girl. She has 3 wubbanubs, and Jasmine Giraffe is by far the cutest."
I love this product and would recommend this to everyone.  The price is so much less and comes in fast.  Our family loves this product and use it often!
This was perfect for our little guy. They are just like the pacifiers in the hospital. Smells like vanilla! Very calming and easy to use.
We bought every cute pacifier under the sun for our daughter but she will only take the First Years GunDrops. Good thing they come in a bunch of colors and we just accessorize with paci straps. This six pack is a total steal and now we don't have to worry that we'll ever find outselves without one in case the dog eats one or one gets left at grandmas or whatever just seems to happen with babies and pacifiers. Do yourself a favor and get a bunch to have on  hand!
This was a big hit at the baby shower!  Everyone could relate.  I would recommend it as a fun shower gift.
"I got this bc I wanted to keep my baby's pacifier on hand just incase she wanted it. I keep it hanging on my diaper bag so I always know where it is and never leave the house without it. I was able to fit 4 small pacifiers 0-3 months ones, I'm sure ill be able to fit less as she gets older n they get bigger."
These were the only pacifiers my daughter could use because she was so tiny when she was born! The traditional pacifiers have such a wide nipple that it wouldn't fit in her mouth! Perfectly pink. Will definitely use with all my future children too!
Easy to find in carseat while driving! And easy for them to find in crib in the middle of the night!
THIS PACIFIER IS VERY FUNNY LOOKING. EVERYONE WHO HAS SEEN IT THINKS ITS THE COOLEST THING EVER. PRICE IS DECENT TOO
"Bought this for my grandson who's due next month. His mommy wanted an Alabama themed nursery and this fit in well with the bedding set I bought on Amazon. It's cute, looks sturdy enough and has the type of pacifiers we wanted to use,"
the product is exactly as shown and described on the site. I'm sure my baby boy will enjoy it once he is born : )
"perfect size, holds two nuk pacifiers and it saves a great deal of time and frustration when needing to grab a paci real quick. The snap isn't too hard and the material is nice.  It can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth to clean."
"I thought the pacifier part would not be appealing since, my daughter hates every pacifier. She loves it! She snuggles with the frog at night even if she is not using the pacifier"
These are the only paci's that our baby girl will take.  Everything else she spits out of her mouth pretty much immediately.  I'm not sure if it's the shape of the nipple (or what) but she loves them.  We also bought MAM bottles after finding out she loves the pacifiers so much.  The nipple for the bottle is the same as the pacifier. Plus the bottles are anti-gas/anti-colic bottles that allow air to release from the bottom.  They are great at keeping our baby from swallowing air and making her gas even worse.
I like this pacifier because the stuffed animal makes it extremely easy for infants to grab. This is the second one I've bought.
Good quality product and very very cute and snuggly. Could also cute the giraffe off the nuk when you are phasing them out which may stop some tantrums
CUTE FUN AND GOT LOTS OF AWWWs at the BABY SHOWER. I put pink bows around froggie's neck and made it perfect for a little girl baby who's mom decorated her room in green and pink!
Creative!  I have given quite a few of these pacifiers as gifts.  It's so cute how little ones can hold on to these.
we love these pacifiers.  Can never have enough of them.  The six pack makes it a little easier to always have a clean one.
I got it for my new nephew who has it at all times. It was recommended by my cousins whose son and daughter were big fans with it.
Have twin 5 month old boys and this pacifier is the best in aiding us in distinguishing whose is whose and best of all...it's hard to lose! It's also easy for the boys to hold which is great since they are just now grasping with their hands and discovering textures.

"This is the brand the hospital gave us. Also, it is the only paci that my newborn will take (if he decides to take one at that moment lol).<br />Very easy to clean, so far very durable. Would definitely recommend."
Bought these for a baby shower. Couple went to South Carolina and are expecting their first child.  These are great and are being sent to a baby shower in California.
This is one of the best inventions ever. It pacifies the baby as well as giving him something to hang on to.
"I can never have enough of these on hand. I keep four of them around for my twins. I love that they help stay put with infants and they additionally seem to be soothing and give them something to grab on to. Also a lot harder to lose, and a lot easier to find in a diaper bag full of stuff! A must have for a shower gift."
Can't wait to see a little baby with this in their mouth. It looks just like the picture and it will be a fun shower gift.
These are the best binkis around.  My daughter is breast fed exclusively and she has been taking these binks since she was about two months and has never wanted any other kind. We have tons of them now and they clean easily. We bought a cheap clevamama microwave sterilizer for binks from this site and they fit right on the branches inside it and clean up beautifully.
"These are great.  I purchased two, because you never know when you might need to bring one with you.  We use Soothies for pacifiers, which EASILY collect pet dander or anything else on the floor.  These cases are great because I can pop the Soothie in there and throw it into my purse or my daughter's diaper bag."
"i was planning my daughter's baby shower (our first grandchild) and had ordered a honey favor from another company online.  it was about a week before the shower was to take place and i realized that the items had not arrived, now approx. three weeks late.  i tried to contact the company several times but was never able to get any response online or by phone ( i immediately went to my bank of course to cancel the charges from this obvious scam).  in a panic i began to search the internet for another company that stocked a similar honey favor.  what a blessing when i found the holy honey company!  i called the telephone number listed and much to my amazement i not only got to speak with a real person but it was the owner of the company.  she was amazing, helpful, kind,  considerate, and assured me that i would receive the product in time for our baby shower.  we received the items days before the shower, they were beautiful and all of our guests loved this unique little gift and of course the tasty honey.  god bless you holy honey for being so wonderful and &#34;saving the day.&#34;"
the product was exactly what i thought it would be regarding quality and value.  i what recommend this for the bob/peg combo.
"i feel so much more comfortable at night since buying this one. especially while co-sleeping, and while transitioning to the crib."
neutral colors were excellent.  best price for these diaper.  the stand up to wear and my husband and day care love the easy use.
"i've been looking for a couple backpack harnesses for my son for a while.  there are a lot of cute ones out there but i wanted something a little different.  when i spotted this i knew i had to try it out.  i was a bit worried because the price seems too good to be true - including shipping!  but i needn't have worried, it's a great item.  we've used it a couple times and it's nice and sturdy and just so stinkin' cute!!"
"two friends of mine had these on their baby registries, so of course, since i think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread, i snatched them off of both registries and just gave them as gifts.  so cute.  so soft. love them. have even considered getting them to swaddle my dog...just kidding.  she doesn't like to be swaddled."
this really helps me out in my shower. i am handicapped and i can now reach my water wand in the shower.
"i ordered this along with other items on my daughter!s baby registry.  it does just what it says, it soothes, great product and comes two in a package, just in case one gets misplaced!"
this carseat was an excellent choice for us because we're interested in extended-rear facing. our one-year old is very petite and we expect this carseat to continue to be the perfect one for her.
this is a nice rattle because it's soft.  babies can't control their motions well but as they age a bit they get some real oomph behind their arm swings.  this rattle is soft so no worries of bruises or smashed fingers when baby pounds this rattle around. we like this and our daughter does too -- she's six months.
"these little diaper covers are well-made, sturdy, and attractive. the design used to make the velcro-style closure tabs is ingenious. they are double sided, so one will stick to the other if you need to overlap them for a better fit on a smaller baby! i absolutely love these!!!"
super cute and comfy. my son loves it because he can see out of the window much easier. it also feels much safer and sturdier than the bucket carseat. highly recommend.
"very cute addition to my 2 year old's minnie room! she loves the bright colors and, of course, minnie everywhere."
i received this in a timely manner; and was very pleased with the product. it works perfectly in my grandson's bedroom. very pretty and well made.
"we had another seat that just sat in the bathtub for our newborn which she hated, so i decided to buy her a little tub of her own. she loves this!  the water stays around her tushy to keep her warm (which the other seat didn't do so i think that's why she hated it) and she enjoys kicking her feet in it to splash water everywhere. :)  i also love that it will adjust by taking out the spacer as she gets older. highly recommend!"
fits the secure beginning's mattress perfectly and is very easy to put together.  the crib is very rugged although there is one board that supports the mattress that they leave raw wood and could use some stain.
Really liked the item. It is very simple to attach to any bags or purses and take with me anywhere.
"The billy bob two front teeth pacifier, arrived and is a great gift! It was a hit at the baby shower!"
this is the second one of these I am buying because my son loves it so much! I had to replace the first one because I washed it one too many times and the pacifier came off. He was not happy about that... so on to number two!
"My grand daughter loves this pacifier, it really cute you can't loose it with the animal on there.  Good item for kids."
Perfect. Quick shipment. Product just as described. If you intend to use a pacifier for your baby these are a must have!!!
My son has two Wubbanubs that we love. So I bought this for a friend for her little girl. It is absolutely adorable!!
My granddaughter loves to hold her wubbanub and so does my daughter...who can find this pacifier one handed in a deep diaper bag. Shipped quickly.
I ordered this product thinking it was really cute and my baby would be able to use it when he was a little older and capable of grasping objects. After talking to my sister about it she let me know that it was used in the NICU and the nurses would stuff the animals down the onsies to help keep the pacifiers in the babies mouths. I've since been doing this and it works like a charm. My little one will continually spit out his binkie and then is unhappy because it is no longer in his mouth. When I put this monkey in his onsie he can go slack jaw and the binkie stays put in his mouth so that when he wants it again it is still there. I would recommend this item to everyone with a baby who likes to suck on pacifiers.
I love every thing about this pacifier! Doesn't look like it's made cheap either...the mustache has grooves in it to make it look more like real hair!! AWESOME!
This was a gift I bought for a baby shower. I have Wubbanub's for my daughter and she loves them. They are easy to clean.
This is such a cute idea. I spent the first months of motherhood looking for an ON/OFF button. This is great!
Very easy for my little guy to hold in place and very<br />Cute.  I love these products.  Have loved all the ones<br />I ordered thus far.
Go these for some friends (Carinal fans) they seem to not like it i love it! Excellent product keep it up.
"My daughter loves all her wubbanubs. I bought 4, 'cause she doesn't accept any other pacifier. The blue bear is really cute and babies love vibrant colors."
love this bought it for a baby shower very cute just wished they had a tan and black pig for boy or girl
thank you for your fast and friendly  serves.the game was really fun to play. It is a grate game for people to get to know one another
"a great, simple, and convenient way to track baby's firsts.  i love the stickers and the cute photos of the animals. it makes a great keepsake!"
"we bought this changing table for our living room - which is one floor below our son's bedroom where his larger table/dresser is. we wanted a smaller option that let us change him downstairs without having to do so on the floor. it is terrific. we use the bottom shelves for canvas storage bins to hold diapers and toys. simple, classic design that fits in perfectly with our contemporary decor. works great in a room with furniture that is dark brown and black."
"i love this crib, it was easy to put together, looks great in my mid-century themed nursery. i love the grey color as well, its not to dark or too light. the product had no smell we took it out of the box when it arrived."
"finally the monitors last through the night, good fit in our graco monitors the lead wires are actually a little longer than the original batteries"
"this monitor is perfect.  i can see the baby at all times, hear him and talk to him.  i love everything about this monitor and highly recommend it."
"having all the areas numbered with a map helped, everything applied to the wall great and the picture frames are one solid piece so you can stick the photos on top of the frame with out ruining the wall. i love it"
"this was a great product for our young son.  he had horrible startle reflexes for a very long time and this helped relieve some of that for him so that we were all able to sleep for longer stretches in those early weeks and months.  i can see how the zipper could be perceived to be a problem when used for prolonged periods of time.  it doesn't feel really durable, but ours never broke and we didn't have issues with it.  the sizing was also accurate.  it stretches just enough to keep baby feeling secure but allowing for some slight movements."
"i found this in other stores and the price was much more. i think this is the best lamp for my jungle theme nursery. the quality is great, and the little monkey light switch, which hangs is so adorable. great product all around !"
love this bag; wish i would have had it with my first kid.  top compartment is great for pacifiers; or need to get asap stuff; bag is roomy and has a nice separation.  only problem was the wipes dispenser not staying closed; however a travel size wipes bag fits in there perfect.  problem solved.
"purchased product to counter issue with electrical interference with old baby monitor.  works great, only negative is that it has very bright operating led lights."
these are the best. my kids use them every weekday at day care and sometimes at home on weekends too. have held up beautifully wash after wash.
we got these once my daughter got her teeth as she was biting the side of the crib and we didn't want her damaging the bed or eating paint! these work well and wash great!!
"granted, it's his favorite thing in a very unscientific poll (he's only a few weeks old), but every time i put him on it, he finds something new and fascinating. it has just enough to keep him entertained, but not too much so that he would be overstimulated. the mat is nice and cushy, and each dangling toy has a different sound and texture. the little mirror is great because it won't break unless you're really, really determined, but it's not super flimsy. my baby looks so happy on it, and i wake up every morning looking forward to using it."
i was a little surprised when i received this in the mail of how small it really is.  they look so big when the babies are holding them.  it is absolutely adorable though!  soft and nice and light so the babies won't have a problem hanging on to them.
"i bought this right before travelling for the first time with my 4-month-old. thank goodness i did! he really needs a pacifier handy at all times, especially when tired or fussy. however, he has just recently figured out how to pull them out of his mouth, which leads to pacis on the furniture, floor, etc. well needless to say i didn't want to risk his pacis ending up on the floor of an airplane or a sandy beach - this was the perfect solution."
"at first i didn't know if i even wanted a mobile for my first baby's room. however, after hearing from many other moms that i had to have one, i set out looking for one that wasn't overly cutesy, circusy, noisy or generally obnoxious. this definitely fits the bill. it is quite hypnotic to watch it spin gently in the air, and my 4-month-old loves staring at it. he often wakes up and begins making sweet coo noises - we say he is &#34;chatting&#34; with his elephants. i think it gives him something to occupy his attention so we don't have to immediately pick him up out of his crib when he wakes."
this is the most price effective pad i have found. it is a nice standard size and fits all the covers well.
"i bought this for my new grandson and his first time mother.  so far we have not had to use it, but i know that when the time comes that we do, it will be perfect for the task.  i would recommend this to my family and friends with children and grandchildren."
"i am yet to meet a tiny love product i don't love. i bought this for my 5-month-old as an alternative to the activity bar that comes with his bouncy seat, figuring he could use a change of scenery since he spends so much time in it! he was immediately intrigued by it. the colors are vibrant and eye-catching. i like the variety of objects, especially the pull string on the flower - something different from all his other hanging toys. it will come in handy on his carseat, bassinet, and eventually his stroller seat, too since its design makes it easy to attach to objects of varying thickness and can be adjusted at different angles. i wish i knew about this for my first kid!"
"my toddler loves this toy!!! she loves changing the attachments and watching the different splash patterns. normally she does not like water on her face, but doesn't mind when this toy does, because splash is light and minimal."
if you need a spare pack & play for a family member (i bought two of these for our mothers homes) or if you have a two story home (keep one upstairs and downstairs) this is the perfect size and price. as easy as the larger versions this smaller footprint would be great for a smaller home too.<br />love it!
when my hubby was in nh he needed a hamper and i got this one. it's size was great and all the staff & hubby loved it. it's a great way to bring a smile to your day!
bought this chair for my 20 year old cat and she just loves it.  easy for her to get in and out of.  i choose the brown gingham and it is quite lovely.
i purchased (2) sets of these and love them.  they are easy to install and easy to operate from the front or back seats.  the shades provide ample protection from sunlight to the grandchildren.
my daughter loved having this toy on her highchair to play with while in her seat!  the suction worked great.  the toy is very sturdy and colorful!
"We haven't had this product very long, and my kid isn't one of those that needs a pacifier all the time. Still, I ordered this product hoping that it would help him keep it in his mouth when he fell asleep with it. It's pretty good at that - but also, it's soft and fun to look at and even though we've only had it a week or so, my son will grasp it and try to get the pacifier back in his mouth. It seems to comfort him, and that's good enough for me!"
"My daughter loves all her wubbanubs. I bought 4, 'cause she doesn't accept any other pacifier. The Yellow Duck is her favourite! I guess she likes the colors. It's my favourite too, so cute!"
"Bought this for my son when he was born. The animal was a little small so it didnt quite keep the pacifier in place, but for the price it was great!"
"We love our moo cow!!  It's even cuter in person- if you can believe that!  These wubanubs are GENIUS!  I went from losing EVERY pacifier to holding on to TWO!  Plus, it's a nice toy as well! :)"
My daughter got this pacifier from the hospital and loves it. So I ordered spares for the diaper bag and around the house. Excellent product.
Love these!  They're great to have on hand when you're out somewhere and baby drops the pacifier!  We use them all the time.
"this product is so original! my baby tried so many pacifiers before, but this definitely is his favorite! Love it!"
Bought this for a shower present and I almost kept it in hopes of another grandbaby! These are loved by everyone that received them and the animals become the children's lovie far beyond the nuk years.
I love this little pacifier bag! Keeps extra binkies handy and CLEAN! What a relief when you have your hands full and a crying baby to have the binky right there! Highly recommend!
"As soon as my 5 month old daughter sat down with her PullyPal, she immediately knew to reach and grab for her passy. This actually taught her how to put her passy in her mouth. This not only allows her to choose which passy she wants, but also keeps them clean. Thank you for creating PullyPalz and teaching my daughter to retrieve her own passy. This is an excellent developmental teaching tool for all babies! #verydurable #cutetolookat #finemotordevelopment #handeyecoordination #amusthave"
My baby boy loves them and the sports are so cute. We got baseball and soccer.  They look great and be uses them a lot
"I love this baby product!  My son loves his WubbaNub and at 7 months can easily put this back in his mouth which helps with self soothing.  These make the perfect baby shower gift.<br /><br />Note:  You can't removed the binkie from the stuffed animal.  To clean, just put in the wash and let air dry.  It took me a bunch of searching to figure this out.  My husband has actually sent them through the dryer a couple times without any damage too."
"I was hesitant to buy this for a LOONG time, and finally bit the bullet when my son was already 9 months old, and we were sick of looking for dropped soothie pacifiers and buying replacement pacifiers.  I wish I bought this from the beginning!  When he sleeps at night, he easily feels for it with his eyes closed, and unconsciously slips it back in his mouth...makes for longer naps!!!  ALWAYS a good thing!  GREAT BABY SHOWER GIFT!"
"My grandson just loves these pacifiers, and so do his parents and I. They don't get lost easily like the single ones and everyone wants to know where we got them. I have ordered many of these as they do eventually get raggedy and worn, or occasionally we do lose one, and have never been disappointed. Price may seem high but we feel they are definitely worth it. The items wash well, and there are many designs to choose from. We seem to prefer the giraffe because the long neck just seems to work better than a puppy or dinosaur, etc. Highly recommend these."
"It didn't exist for my first child, what a shame! This is a great idea, well executed. My son has had this one and the lamb one for 16 months now and they're still fine!"
Item was part of a baby shower gift. Recipient loved it. Will order again in the future for additional gifts.
These are great for every little Bulldogs fan out there! I definitely recommend them! Love these! They are so cute!
"Great quality product. Not only is it great for soothing baby as a pacifier, but the mustache serves as a teether for my son."
"love this, the small stuffed animal helps paci stay in place and acts as a toy and a soother all in one."
"These are my favorite pacifiers because unlike the advent ones they don't seem to fall out of the baby's mouth as easily. Plus now that he is teething he chews on them! I order a new set every 6 weeks (that's the recommended time for replacement by the doctor) so that I can have one in the crib, one in the car seat, one in the play pen, one in the pack n play, a couple in the diaper bag... well you get the idea ;)"
"My daughter only uses a binky to sleep or calm herself since birth (and now still at 6mos).  She was always dropping them and we had to put one back in her hand or mouth, constantly!  We tried straps too which helped us find the binky but was no use for her.  We also didn want to put her in the crib with anything with straps/clips on it to avoid various hazards there.  Then we found the wubbanub and it has exceeded our expectations.  With the wubbanub she can find and grab the body without our intervention and she loves the characters.  We have the giraffe and frog and she loves looking at the faces and then puts the pacifier, head or one of the legs in her mouth (sometimes all at the same time).  We wash it regularly and don't leave the house without it.  We have lots of cute photos too with an animal hanging out of her mouth :-)  Only improvement would be to offer a version with replaceable binkies or at least an option for the 3+ month stronger plastic.  Wee had both for 4 months and no visible wear and bodies are still solidly stitched."
"Our daughter has used this style since she was born and really likes it. This 6 pack is perfect now that she's gotten a little older. We plan on weening her off when she gets around 1 like we did with our first. Until then, these are our number one choice"
Keeps the binky in sight which I ended up Liking the most. Babies can also easily hold on to this really easily. And I truly believe that Wubbanub helped with my son grabbing things on his own.
I got this because my daughter loves turtles and her son already has a bear one. It is easy to locate and easy for my grandson to pick up and put right in his mouth. I would recommend this to anyone that has a baby.
"Not only is this pacifier hilarious, but it is also high quality and not some cheaply made novelty item. Well worth the purchase."
"Only pacifier my NB would take. Perfect fit for his mouth. Ended up ordering more , you can never have enough."
"Our son loved his WubbaNub! He just recently gave up the pacifier, but up til now, he looked forward to going to bed each night so he could spend time with his WubbaNub. It helped him find his pacifier at night so we didn't have to go into his room and find it for him, and it works like a stuffed animal too, giving him comfort from the personality of the animal. If our second son, born recently, desires a pacifier as well, we'll be getting him a WubbaNub as well."
good price. had to buy as our daughters puppy keep getting ahold of these and ate them. guess he thought was his. lol  Good quality for the money

It helped him find his pacifier at night so we didn't have to go into his room and find it for him, and it works like a stuffed animal too, giving him comfort from the personality of the animal. If our second son, born recently, desires a pacifier as well, we'll be getting him a WubbaNub as well."
I love this item! It makes keeping up with it much easier! My son likes something to hold on to also!
"buy these to add to a growing theme in our game room.  great size, vivid colors and easy to install.  kids love em."
"we've used these consistently with our cloth diaper regimen. they are great at the &#34;dirty job&#34; they are meant for. they are flushable, not rough to the touch and affordable. highly recommend."
"i did lots of research before buying this product for my second son, having struggled on with a cheap high chair with my first son.it is easy to strap my son in, it keeps him in an upright position, wheels round the kitchen easily and looks great. i can't fault it. most important of all, it is sooooo easy to clean. i wasted so much precious time cleaning my old high chair i wish i had bought this much sooner."
"my baby loves this and only naps in this!  it's very soothing for the baby, and very secure.  she is 3 months now, and has been using it since she was born.  i can put her in this for a nap and then go take a shower or do chores.  i highly recommend for all new moms!"
glad i got this.  i fit two nuk pacifiers in this for my son.  i throw it in my diaper bag and it's easy to find because of the nice red color.
"i like this style and brand the best. i have tried many and have a drawer full to prove it. this material is machine washable which is nice b/c some are not. dries quickly, hang/line dry. this also covers chest, belly, and shoulders. by putting the arms through the arm slots it prevents it from shifting. plus it has a longer front with a pocket so it catches most food and keeps the lap clean."
these are my preferred utensils for my toddlers.  they are easy to grip and easy to use.  i highly recommend!
we have a strange stairs that go down in the middle of our living room with a banister and 1/2 wall. No gate would work so we ended up using these gates and extensions to make our living room into a play pen. The baby can roll and crawl without being able to leave the living room. This is working for us better then trying to just gate off the stairs.
My grandson loves this so much I ordered a spare.  He loves to hold the giraffe and it is just the right size for his little hands.
"There's nothing fancy about these, but they do what they are meant to! We attach them to a variety of our son's toys and then to the carseat, stroller, or shopping cart and we aren't losing things along the way! Great solution!"
"My daughter loves these things and I'm having trouble breaking her of them at 2+ years old, but the new baby hates them and won't take a pacifier.  I still think they're the best pacifiers on the market (even if he won't take one).  They always helped my daughter to keep her mouth flanged out... then it was easier for her not to &#34;clamp down&#34; on me when breastfeeding."
Bought for my new nephew and its everyone's favorite. Came on time and its just a normal pacifier with a funny saying.
"We ordered this for our son's first birthday party coming up and it's so funny!  He likes pacifiers and this one isn't too different in feel from the one's he has, so he uses it."
"I purchased this as a gift for my friend who is having a baby, my daughter loves hers and it is part of our nap/bedtime routine. It also makes it much easier to find in the carseat while in the car. Washing is easy, we just put it in a pillow case and run it in the washing machine then let it air dry. Never leave the house without it :)"
This is so cute. I got it for my future Grand son that turned out to be a girl! But it still looks cute. Thank goodness they don't make these in adult size as I'm sure the whole family would get them for funny family pictures!
"I bought this for my son before he was even born. Once he was here he loved it. I liked it because in the middle of the night it is much easier to find a pacifier attached to a monkey than one that is all by itself. Now that he is 10 months old he doesn't really suck on the pacifier as much as he likes to cuddle with the monkey. I think this will make it easier to take the pacifier away. One suggestion that I have is buy two..lol.. when my son started teething and drooling the monkey got pretty gross and smelly, and if your kid likes it as much as mine it is kinda hard to put in the laundry for a couple of hours. I have put it in the washer and dryer many times and it is still good as new."
"Philips AVENT BPA Pacifier are very quality products. High quality products. my 9 months old daughter plays with it too, like a toy."
great item. keeps baby entertained. when she lost the first one had to get a new one would not stop crying if she didnt get it
"It took our baby girl a long time until she can actually hold the frog (we named him Freddie the Frog). But now at 6 months old she can pick it up and put it in her mouth easily. She also enjoys sucking on the frog's arms and legs.<br /><br />Quality is great and none of them are falling apart. One stays in the car seat, one stays in the crib, and one makes its way around the house or in the diaper bag as a back-up."
"This was the only pacifier my son would take for the first few months of his life, and now he loves the stuffed part and keeps it as a &#34;lovie or chewie&#34; at night. Although he doesn't normally take pacifiers, so having one he liked was great."
My boy loves it like it was a stuffed animal he would normally want to sleep with.  its a great idea.
"My baby was given a Soothie brand pacifier in the NICU so we stayed with it when we got home. This giraffe is great! When he spits it out we don't lose it, and it's so easy to find in the middle of the night. The giraffe is even better than his dinosaur version as it is a little smaller and he can easily grab the neck to keep hold of it. I'll be buying these as gifts."
This is one of the best items I have purchased for my baby. Super cute and it prevents the whole spitting out the soothie and it bounces into hiding problem. I will buy one of these for anyone I know having a baby from now on!
I love this pacifier My son already lost two pacifier because i can not find a pacifier holder where I live so I brought Wubbanub pacifier so i don't lose it my son love it.  I receive this product on time Thank you
My boy loves it like it was a stuffed animal he would normally want to sleep with.  its a great idea.
No more losing the pacifier when it is attached to a cute puppy. Easy for tiny hands to hold on to and put back in to their mouth.
"this calendar gives you a format to write daily notes about what's happening with your little one. there's a monthly page to write baby's likes/dislikes, milestones etc. also spots for monthly pics and a page to write the family tree + background and letters from mommy and daddy. cute illustrations and stickers to mark milestone (1st smile, sits up etc.)."
my daughter has special needs and tends to put her shirt in her mouth when she gets frustrated. this has led to almost every shirt having holes in them. this necklace has provided the stimulation she needs and has become the best replacement for her shirts. we are very pleased with this product.
my daughter loves these forks and they are the perfect size for us to feed her or her to feed herself.
it is absolutely perfect for what i needed. it's light weight and easily portable. the &#34;tray&#34; slopes when baby is in the seat so there would be no way for me to put a bowl or anything on it but it is perfect for sporting events where i need him playing in one spot.
i really like the babybjorn baby carrier. it is easy to adjust and my little one is really comfortable in it. he usually falls asleep within minutes of being put in it.
"i ordered this because my toddler started getting sweaty back as it became summer. i wanted something natural against his skin since we live in an urban area and take him in a stroller on the metro everyday to daycare. all the other stroller liners out there.... well, there were mixed reviews and so i decided to go for wool. a bit counter intuitive because i think of wool as keeping me warm. but it has really worked at wicking moisture! he doesn't get 'sweaty back' any longer and seems overall more comfortable in his stroller. he is still \\warm\\ when we take him out, but that is very different than sweaty, in my book.<br /><br />i am buying another one to go in his car seat, which is the next problem. we don't use our car too much, but somehow the straps in our stroller make it not as convenient to switch the liner back and forth (fault of the stroller, not the liner although if the liner openings were constructed differently i guess you could slip it off).<br /><br />anyway, i'm sooo happy about the product, i'll just suck it up and buy another one (it obviously isn't inexpensive). but the quality is great and extremely well made. i bought a wool mattress topper for winter and this is 10x nicer in texture and craftsmanship. we actually started calling it \\wooly\\ as though it was a stuffed animal. ha.<br /><br />i wanted to let other parents know since there weren't any reviews on this product! love it!"
"this gift bag is a nice size and a good, sturdy weight. it will be perfect for a baby shower gift."
"Out of all the larger gates we tested this one was the best, and also the most economical.  The other units didn't open or close properly or required drilling - this one is old school and perfect for our stairwell!"
This pacifier was everything we expected!  I love the way the baby can hold it and is comforted. We highly recommend it.
I bought this pacifier to replace the puppy one we had that was lost.  I was excited when I saw that there was an alligator to chose from I had to get it since my son's room theme was baby alligator's.  This product &#34;Wubanub&#34; is a great product.  It is very durable and you are able to wash it easily in the wash!!
"My 3 month old loves mam binkis, and is very gassy/ has colic. And I have tried many bottles. After buying these my search is over! Love them. She isn't nearly as gassy and doesn't spit up as much! Plus they form to her mouth leaving less of a formula mess!! Love love love them! And sense most states don't sell them I was glad amazon did when I went on vacation... Highly recommended for fussy, gassy babies with colic :)"
I received this as a gift from a friend and lost it when we were out walking in the neighborhood!  My son loves his &#34;puppy&#34; and called out to it.  I scrambled to find it to replace it and found it on here!!  Was so relieved!!!  We are reunited with &#34;puppy&#34; again!!!  Love this product!!!  Such a lifesaver!!!  :)
"My daughter has 5 &#34;wubbies&#34;  this cow is by far her favorite.  It is so soft, and she loves to play with the ears, especially when she is very tired.<br />Because it is her favorite it has been washed about many times...it washes very well, it always comes clean and it holds up great."
"Our son will use these until he's about 18mo.  We are happy with the quality - he chews on them sometimes, and they have held up well.  We also used the 0-6 and 6-12 sizes."
"For whatever reason, our son prefers the AVENT pacifiers over all the others.  I also like the freeflow design as he has very sensitve skin and these allow his skin to breath and don't cause irritation like some others."
"I brought this for my 2 months old. I found out the Giraffe is slightly bigger and heavier than the other WubbaNubs. (3oz, 7 x 1 x 4 inches. You can find the information of each WubbaNubs on the product information / Technical Details). So, it actually stay better compare with the other WubbaNubs. Happy about the product."
This pacifier looks just like the pictures. Nothing to say other than they will make even the ugliest baby Awesome!
We absolutely love the Wubbanub pacifiers.  We were given one as a gift when our daughter was born and now we give them to everyone we know who has a baby.  They are fantastic and so cute.
"My son is really attached to his pacifier - these were great. I transitioned him to these from the gumdrop ones they gave us at the hospital. He's outgrowing these now at 4 months, but he is learning to manipulate his pacifier on his own so we give him these to play with. Much better for him to smash the soft rubbery ones into his face than the hard plastic Mam pacifiers he uses now!"
My baby girl loves her wubbaNub! It's a cute cuddly stuffed animal with her comfort pacifier. When she would chew through the pacifier I would cut it off and she would still have her puppy.
"This is SUPER cute!!  I cannot wait to try it out on my little prince!  Even if he doesn't prefer the nipple shape, its still a cute baby item to display in his nursery!  Would recommend to a friend!"
"Starting at around 6 months, my son really started to love this.  When they're little, it's easy to lay it on their chest so it doesn't fall out of their mouth quite as easy.  When they're older, they look for their giraffe.  The only thing I don't like is keeping the stuffed animal part clean because it gets wet easily with slobber.  But throw it in the wash and it's back to new.  Definitely don't put it in the dryer though."
Bought this for my preemie grandson who is in the NICU ... huge hit.. every one loves it in his pictures.. and of course he does too.. :)
Its cute its adorable and would recommend it for any one with infants.. :)  I bought it for my daughter because  she wanted it for my preemie grandson.. It is a huge hit in he NICU
"My son loves his monkey Wubbanub. Everyone comments about it, but mostly he can easily find it in his crib or diaper bag.  A great purchase."
I absolutely adore this company?. Two of my cousins just had babies and I bought them both this product? They loved them. Nicely done?perfect shower gift. Shipping with amazon prime was super fast and everything was packaged well.  VERY VERY NICE PRODUCT!!!!! And ever so cute!!! ~~~ caitie xoxox
"We have been dealing with the issue of making too much milk, and needed a pacifier for our little one to be able to comfort himself, since he would overeat if he stayed on the breast.  After trying a number of others, this one proved to be the one our son would use.  He just spit out the others."
"I thought this was supposed to be a mute button for my cousin's infant but instead it's just a pacifier.  It is a very high quality, BPA-free pacifier, but I found if you really need to silence the baby it just takes a couple good shakes (kidding!)"
"When our daughter was under 2 months, she was FUSSY and we were willing to try ANYthing to get her and keep her asleep. Friends recommended a pacifier, but she was so little (6 pounds at birth), she couldn't keep a pacifier in her mouth, and if she lost it, that only made her 1000 times fussier. And then we found the wubbanub. Even when she was very young, she could hold onto this pacifier. She loves the pattern, and she enjoys chewing on all parts of it. It's also easy to find, and hard to lose - a winning combo. There's something extra special about the giraffe. We have a little duck wubbanub too, but the horns on the giraffe and the weight of the feet just make it perfect somehow....Whoever invented these is genius. Also, if you are concerned, the wubbanub is light enough that a baby can easily move it, so you don't have to worry about a suffocating/choking hazard."
Product is a bigger version of the 0-6 months pacifier i liked those pacifiers so i bought the 6 - 18 month pacifier and the baby is happy can't ask more than that!
Product is a bigger version of the 0-6 months pacifier i liked those pacifiers so i bought the 6 - 18 month pacifier and the baby is happy can't ask more than that!  more than that!
"Big hit at my daughters baby shower!! Great quality, haven't used them yet since the baby isn't born...hope she likes them."
Our baby really likes these pacifiers and my husband loves the sports themed ones. We like to have one handy for when he gets fussy!
"Mustaches were meant for babies.  Super adorable, about large...but kids will fit them eventually.  I would recommend buying for family and friends."
These are all the babies in my family's preferred pacifier. I love the clear and cut out plastic around the mouth piece. It is still allows you to see how cute there are and doesn't take over the look of their face too much. We have the infant ones and will get the larger size when needed.
"I fought the idea of a pacifier for my second son, but he was colicky and we resorted to any method possible to stop the screaming. He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm."
wubbanubs are the only paci my baby likes.  The elephant is super cute and his big ears are easy for a young baby to hold.
Wubbanubs are the only paci my baby will take.  The alligator is really cute and easy for him to hold onto.
"My son loves his Wubbanub, I have two now and will order another one. They are great in the case they wake up at night and have to search for it."
My daughter loves these Pacifiers! I reccommend them for all expecting parents. The dog is especially appealing to her because of it's bright red color. Toy was shipped fast. Very happy customer. :)
My little guy loves this pacifier.  It is easy for him to grab and put in his mouth.  It doesn't go bouncing across the floor when he drops it.
"Bought as a gag gift for an expecting friend. They loved it! Said it wasn't fully functional for baby in first few months because it is too long, but now they use it and it generates many laughs! In a gift basket for the expecting from here on out!"
My daughter loves them!  And the fact that they glow in the dark makes it so much easier for us to find in her crib at night!
"I have bought 2-3 of these for both my girls. I absolutely LOVE them and so do my girls. Easy to wash, they're easier to find so I'm never frantically searching for it, and the animal makes it easy for the girls to grab them and put it in their mouth. Not to mention they love cuddling with it :) very durable as well. The first one lasted about a year!"
"this fits my safty1st playard, i was so happy i found something to give my little one more cushion it that hard cardboard playard."
"i actually ordered a much cheaper high-chair ($100) and they took over 10 days to ship it so i cancelled and ordered this once. i'm so glad. it's not too cheap but the price is great for a chair your kid will be using for some years! cleans up so easily, shipped super fast, it has wheels and i push it everywhere so easily and i love the print! i love the huge tray it comes with and also the smaller tray!"
"what i love about these bibs:<br /><br />1. the material: with these bibs, you can simply dab your child's drool-soaked chin and it absorbs the drool fabulously. i like this far more than plain old cotton bibs.<br />2. the awesome colors<br />3. the fact that they're solid and don't say anything stupid like \\mommy's little helper\\<br />4. the price<br /><br />note: a number of people complain about the harsh velcro and i agree it's pretty sharp if it rubs against baby's neck -- but we solved this simply by wearing the bib with the green sprouts logo/tag against the baby's chest. if worn in that direction than the sharper side of the velcro doesn't rub on the neck (but you still have to be careful when taking the bib off).<br /><br />we've used these every day for 8 months and love them!"
"Who doesn't love a WubbaNub?  This combination pacifier and friend has been very popular with my child for his first two years of life.  And now, to try to get him away from the beloved pacifier...this is the goal.  Eventually they do get a bit worn at the seams but that is after LOTS of use!"
Pros:<br />1. Does not leave a ring or red marks on the face like Nuk brand<br />2. Easy to wash and can be stored on a bottle rack<br />3. Can be attached to pacifier clips<br />4. Hole in the middle allows you to insert your pinky which stimulates baby to suck (at least it did with ours).<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!
"I bought this as a gift for my new nephew, but it's the perfect size and weight for infants.  It gives them something to grab onto and heavy enough to stay in place for those just learning, but easy enough for them to spit out and not choke.  Love the turtle!"
"My son uses this as a blankie to suck his thumb.  The first one was purchased as a gift but as he grew more attached, I purchased another for daycare & another for when the first needed to be washed.  He doesn't used it to chew on but to rub on his face when he sucks his thumb.  He's been using them for about 6 months & after repeated washings, they are all holding up great!"
"my new granson loves it. Now 3 months old and is easy to hold ,pet and touch. Ordered additional animal to have in car"
Bought these for my infant because I could not find these colors locally. She love them and used them until I broke her from them when she turned 10 months and had from teeth.
Very good price! very good quality! I will defenetly recoment it to my friends. I will buy  more in the future!
too cute for words! I actually ordered several of these. Love them! The pacifier are removable for easy clean up.
"great gift<br /><br />excellent quality, still being used like new 2 years later, i would recommened this product for new moms<br /><br />thanks"
It was just what it said it would be. My mother-to-be loved it. It was given as a gift at a shower and it  made every one laugh
this was the best thing i ever found. i tried to get my boy to take a pacifier (for when i went back to work) but he wouldnt take anything until we found this and were able to teach him how to use the pacifier by sticking our finger in it. he wont use anything else. only down side is that most pacifier clips and covers do not work with this kind of pacifier.
"These pacifiers are so great, they are the only ones my little guy will use!<br />perfect for car trips because they don't fall behind them in the seat when they spit them out.<br />Especially when he gets upset in the car he hugs onto the stuffed animal part, and it clams him down.<br />also it's much esier to find in the diaper bag than those tiny pacifers that fall to the bottom and get all gross.<br />my advice is get several... and keep in every room! ."
"This is the only binky my grandson will use, we love it. It,s also durable<br />Like the idea of two binkies in the package"

"very nice product. will work very well hanging from a stroller. a pacifier pod, what will they think of next"
"Love these Dummies, you can see your little one sucking!<br />Life saver for any new mum!<br />Great colours to choose from!"
Everything went fine. My baby was crying all night and this was the solution for her. Are small for her mouth. She really likes this pacifier
My daughter absolutely loves these things.  Pretty steap price for a pacifier but she loves them.  One for the mouth and two more to stick her index finger into the binky. She is 2 yrs old and i have had a supply of these around since birth.
This infant pacifier meets and exceeds all of my wishes. Easy for a baby to hold and makes it easy to find it when misplaced. Quality made.
I haven't yet used to pacify game yet. however I did open the package and I'm sure we will enjoy the game once the baby shower starts.
it is so lovely that my baby loves it so much<br />well made and no harmful and strange smells<br />it is quite good
"My infant does not want to go to sleep.  I am convinced he purposely spits out his pacifier in a last ditch attempt to wake himself up.  I tried the Wubbanub hoping it would make it harder for him to spit it out.  IT REALLY WORKS.  My infant spits out the pacifier, but it is positioned right on his chest, so he can get it back in his mouth!  It is wonderful.  Granted, it doesn't work 100% of the time, especially when he starts rocking in his swaddle, but it has made bedtime so much more easier.  This is a must for parents with infants."
"We got lots of pacifiers through baby showers and gifts, etc... but my husband bought this online and the baby LOVES this one the best! We got a two pack so one stays in his room and the other in the living room with the playard. its definitely his &#34;Go to&#34; paci. :)"
This is one of my baby's favorite paci.  The hospital gave it to him first and I have bought a variety of paci's and he enjoys this brand the most.
"We're getting ready to move to Texas, so it seemed only fitting to get our daughter the Longhorn Bull! We LOVE Wubbanubs!"
I love this!  It's so cute and my daughter loves that she has something to hold on to.  She actually pulls her pacifier out less since she is holding onto the animal.
"Our son loves this. It's helped him to keep his pacifier in his mouth. We also bought 'Gary' the giraffe. He's grabbing now and has figured out how to yank this out of his mouth. But it's great as far as not having a string attached to a pacifier. And it gives him something to cuddle too. Well made, easy to care for."
"I was able to modify this tabby wubbanub onto a first years Gumdrop pacifier. I made it so I can exchange pacifiers once a month, and then while I am exchanging pacifiers, I can also throw it in the laundry!!! I am going to try to put a pic up on top"
"Bought this for my cousin's baby shower. She's a FL Gators fan. I learned with my own baby, that kids love these!"
"My son is crazy for his wubbanubs, and this is a nice one.  Some hold up better than others in the washing machine, and this is a good example of that.  After many washes it still looks good and not overly worn out."
i love the product and my baby enjoys it as well it is a great gift and a wonderul idea.
I loved this pacifier! It looked so cute on my little nephew. I am definitely happy that I got it.
"These are so cute and my son loves them.  It was great quality and good value.  Plus, it never seems like you have enough binkies!"
"I had trouble finding a pacifier holder for the soothie pacifiers that would keep them clean in the diaper bag. This little pouch works great and you can cram up to three soothies in there with ease. It can also be snapped to the diaper bag, carseat or stroller to make it easier to find for those meltdown moments. It is what I needed."
You got to love pacifiers that have the Atlanta Braves logo on them.  We are great fans and love these.
This is the only brand of pacifiers my little one will use and she loves the cute animal pictures on these.
Purchased this as a gift. It is so funny to see baby use this - he looks like he is kissing a kitten!<br />Pacifiers are necessities and this one is soooo cute<br /><br />Item arrived on time
"This is a gift for my soon to be niece, my brother complained that all the presents were too girly. This is the perfect fit to the little girls collection!!!!"
"Our baby will never have teeth like these. Nevertheless, it was hilarious to see on him and folks thought it was funny."
This thing is amazing I mean since I'm an ab type person ahaha<br />Well the mouth piece the shape is amazing and the feel so I could suck on it all day and the skull and crossbones on the front is so adorable. I love this thing<br /><br />I would so recommend it
"People loved the grillz, and were LOL when they saw it. Baby liked the functionality of the soother. Must have for fun"
These are hard to find and I was thrilled to get them! My daughter will only take this kind so when these came in the mail I was so happy! Great product and quick shipping
These are my daughters favorite pacifiers! We have three dogs who love to steal them so I am constantly buying new ones. I have the best luck with prices on AMAZON!
Got this along wih the Giraffe Bestever Baby Mat and both were very well received by the happy new parents. Nice quality and super cute!
"Initially my son did not take to pacifiers at all, but I did not want him to be a thumb sucker.  So I bought this at 4 months old and almost tossed it.  Decided to keep it and BOY am I glad I did!! He goes everywhere with monkey.  At night, if he wakes, he'll cry a bit and tos around and he can find him so much easier than a plain pacifier and plop him right back in his mouth for a good nights rest.  He loves monkey and so do we!!"
"this product is excellent. it fits the mouth of the baby, without squeezing or hurting, is very light and the inner small and anatomically"
"I got this in the hope to get my second kid hooked on pacifiers.  If anything to maybe enjoy a car ride with an infant, as my first child was miserable to be around when in a vehicle. Six months later: She uses it, cuddles it, loves flinging it around.  The 2 year old loves it and made it her personal mission to be on &#34;kitty fetching duty&#34;, for the baby whenever she fussed.  We love it cause she's happy in the car, sleeps with it when she's not cosleeping, and it's cute.<br /><br />Our first one the nose embroidery unraveled at about 4 months, but I just cut it off, so what if kitty has a pink nose or not.  We got a second and I noticed that old and new were quite similar; with weekly/biweekly soaks in oxiclean, 6 months of wear doesn't really show.  Now one lives in the carseat and one lives in the crib. The product picture is slightly different, the kitties have white &#34;pads&#34; to the feet, not tabby pattern.<br /><br />Happy with our purchase, worth the expense."
"I bought this for my newborn son. We have yet to use it, as it is for 3 months+. But it is very cute and well made. Would recommend this product to others"
"So cute and cuddly. Would recommend to a friend. Baby is able to place pacifier in mouth, and remove on his own."
"Easy to read, pretty sturdy ( had been drooped couple of times ) and pretty handy if you have a baby at home ..  even will work with adults ..  :D"
when I saw this I liked it my son loves Turtle so I know his son is going to love it to
"I was worried that changing from the orthodontic type to the bulb type was going to disturb my little guy, but these work better for chewing on in my opinion."
I'm glad I bought this.  I wasn't going to because of the reviews stating that it smelled rotten or it doesn't smell good.<br /><br />So the first thing I did after receiving this item is to open it and smell it.  It smelled like apple juice.  Open up a canister of apple juice and that's what it smells like... Sweet yet tarty at the same time.  Now I understand why some people might think it smells horrible but I don't have a problem with it. I love apple juice.<br /><br />It wipes the pacifier as its supposed to.  I usually also use it to wipe my Medela breast pump parts after using them.  It's way thinner than the expensive Medela wipes but it wipes the part down good enough.
It is a safe material. I wll recommend it to anyone with babies. Beside that t was hilarious.  We had a lot of laugh out of this pacifier.
I was able to make a corsage for the baby shower out of it and it was so cute and different.
"The hospital started us on Soothie pacifiers, but they kept falling out of DD's mouth and to the floor. We found Wubbanubs (they use a Soothie paci) and they solved the problem. They stay on her chest and she can even push the paci back into her mouth if it comes out. LOVE!!!  We now have 3."
"I purchased this game for the children of baby shower guests to play so that they can feel like they were apart of the party and game time/prize winning. I prepared a small thank you bag for all the children participating in this game. They all loved playing it and it was very entertaining for the guests to watch as their children tried blindly, to attach the pacifier to the right place. Keeping this game in case I happen to host another baby shower. It was tons of fun!"
I got this pacifier for my grand baby and she loves it. The duck allows her to be able to hold her pacifier for herself. She looks so cute huging the duck while she sucks her pacifier. And when it gets dirty I can just wash it in the machine and sterilze the pacifier
My kids love it;  we are collecting all models; if you are looking the best try to give it to your kids happiness and healthy products
"My daughter can not live without this pacifier.  She loves feeling the softness of the animal and she's able to keep it in her mouth with the help of the furry animal.  Love, love!"
I love this and think it is amazing so I bought it as a baby gift for a family member.
"Son loves these!  The pacifier is sort of cheaply attached to the doll portion, but you could always sew it back on when it falls off like my mother had to do for her grandson!"
"Our daughter is very stubborn about pacifiers.  She wouldn't take one at all until about 3 months old.  She still does not like them, but out of the 7 different types we bought, this is the only one she's accepted."
Love it! My daughter goes nuts for these things and rightfully so! She gets a lovey and pacifier in one! Totally love these things!
Great nook but it baby does not seem to be attached to the nook like my other kids were.  The stuffed animal makes it more of a toy so it is being played with as much as it is being used as a nook.
"I used this cute and functional item to tie into the ribbons on my new grand daughter's welcome gift. It is well made no sharp edges. She is still too young for a Pacifier, the Pediatrician said 4 weeks old, when she has nursing down pat. Until then it is cute sitting on her chest of drawers."
I got  these to give as a gift in one of my craft projects. They were the perfect size and the colors were beautiful. They also come on a case to keep them clean. I would recommend these pacificiers to anyone who needs a good pacifier.
My baby boy loves his wubbanub pacis! I think the bull is sooo supe cute! The animals help the paci stay in!
I gave this as a baby shower gift and it was a huge hit with the parents and grandparents. Stachified!
My grandson loves the one he has similar to this.  It makes a great baby gift for a baby that loves his/her pacifier.
"This is a miracle product.  WubbaNub should win a prize, for most awesome baby product for PARENTS!  Why parents? Because you finally do not have to get up every 2 min to put the soothie back in after your baby spits it up!<br /><br />My baby played a game called stupid soothie and mommy, where she would suck the soothie until mommy got back in bed, waited 2 min for mommy to get comfy, and BAM, spit it out, or with the help of her tiny long fingers, hurl the soothie right out of the crib.  I swear I would get up at least 20 times with each time I put her in the crib.  I was growing so frustrated.  Then while reading some forum, I kept seeing references to Wubbanub, due to the odd name, I looked it up, and it was like a bright light had shined on me!  I was saved!  I ordered one immediately, and life has been a bliss ever since!  My baby would also go into crying spells in the car, when I drove and the soothie fell out, and I had no way of getting it back into babies mouth asap.  The Wubbanub has stopped all of this drama.  The bear design in particular works better than some others, the month of the bear is bigger and holds the soothie down and in the mouth.  We also have the giraffe, and while cute, the mouth of giraffe where soothie is connected is thin and longer, and the soothie doesn't stay in quite as well as with the bear.<br /><br />Additional tip: if you put a blanket on top of the bear, it stays in even better, less risk of slipping out.  Also, after the initial wash/soothie boil, instead of boiling everyday and getting half the bear wet, I bought pacifier wipes that work well to get all the grime/germs off.<br /><br />This has seriously been a life saver!"
absolutely love it! it goes with my nephew's bedroom theme. contemporary without being too bulky. love the stickers. my brother and sister-in-law are so pleased.
"safe and easy to use; open, close and store. terrific to put in car and take the baby around without having to remove the car seat from the base.<br />a satisfied grandpa!"
"this was some of the best money i spent on baby toys!  my daughter used this from a few weeks old until she was sitting up and crawling.  the mat is now put away, but the toys are still played with.  the star is amazing! i don't know what it is about it, but she loves.  as a baby, she would just lay there and smile and coo at it.  as a toddler, she loves watching the light flashing and listening to the music.  my 3 and 5 year old will snitch it from her and play with it.  i put the star on the carseat when we were out, the pack and play to soothe her to sleep away from home. she is 15 months and still walks around playing with it.  the music is soothing and enjoyable to listen to and not too loud.  the mat is fairly sturdy and so vibrant and colorful.  tummy time was spent propped up a little bit with her starting at the mirror and grabbing the stuff on the mat.  the other toys are also exciting for her and she still plays with them, too, especially the teething toy.<br /><br />i bought this for my twin nephews as well.  one loves it as well and with lay there grabbing at the toys, but the other one doesn't like to be stuck there.<br /><br />this is so well worth getting.  it folds up to nothing to store away.  i would slide it behind a chair, the swing, or the couch when she wasn't playing with it. it is the most attractive of any i have looked at.  definitely recommend."
i needed a to clean inside bottle and it cheap and dose the job<br />buy it  if you need something simple to do the job.
"i first got this product to go camping and keep up with potty training my toddler. i loved how compact it is, so i bought more of them to take anywhere (it is great to use in public bathrooms)."
i am so pleased these work with my medela pump. i was looking for the soft flanges and didn't find them but somehow came across these and they work great! i think the size is more based on your cup size.
it looks exactly as pictured and was delivered in satisfactory shape.  my baby is not born yet so i can only attest to its looks.
"this little guy goes everywhere with us. even though my son has stopped taking a pacifier i still stick him in the car seat with him. in fact, he is in his bed right now. i think i might even remove the pacifier eventually and hand sew him back up. i highly recommend this product."
i found this this in a card shop but was to pricey. i went on line to find it and much better pricing ordering on line with amazon. i just thought this was the cutest monkey blanket. my daughters theme is all monkeys and this was a perfect gift! just love it!!!<br />angie from san antonio texas
this is the best play yard ever. from newborn to toddlers. i have used this for years and it is still in awesome shape! i especially loved the newborn napper they don't all come with these!
the delivery time was good and the product was a great buy.  there were really more pieces than i needed for decor and i will give the extra stuff to friends.
my daughter loves these type of sippy cups and she is very picky about what kind she uses because she refuses to take bottles.  i love how i got different colors too and how they were cheaper here than in the store.  plus super fast shipping!!!!
this looks really cute on the crib.  it was easy to get decorations to match the colors of the comforter.
"my littlest grandson plays with his rattle and loves it so!  nice size, and comfortable fit in baby's hand.  practical and playful!"
"works flawlessly, and 100% necessary if you want to take your tot on walks before she is old enough to sit in the bob itself (outside of the graco seat). highly recommended."
"18 months later this is still my daughter's favorite sleep item.  it's cute, it's cuddly.  she likes it so much we got two of them just in case we lose one."
"as a grammy of four i love this item.  it's easy to clean, fits all sized necks. and catches everything that misses their mouths from 7 months to well over two years. between meals i just wipe it off  but after a full days use, i throw it on the top shelf of the dishwasher to sanitize it for the next visit. each grand child has his or her own color, so by seeing the bib, he/she knows food is on the table."
"summer infant swaddleme sacks are my favorite sleep sacks because they zip form the bottom up. you never have to fit the two sides of the zipper together, which makes putting the sack on the baby very easy."
i have used these before with my first son. now time for the second. i guess my boys pee a lot! so these help so i don't have to change sheets every night! i can't get them here on maui so i order them but another awesome product nanny/mommy swears by!
"liquid falls through, but poo dose not! fricken awesome right??? i started using cloth with my first child. and stopped once she started having nasty poops. its such a pain cleaning stuck on poop off a grovia insert. lol then my son was born, and upon doing more reading about grovia products, i saw these. they have put my daughter back in cloth, and i'm so happy! i can't even imagine the money i would have saved if i had only found these sooner! get them! i know now, that my son will be a full time, tell hes potty trained cloth diapering baby!"
"better then the original and i like the original a lot.  great use of multifunction, multiuse stroller.<br />chic design and very reasonable price for the seat/shopping bag and other accessories.  this seller includes all you need, others will only sell u seat."
love them my nephew would not hold a regular bottle because they're cold<br />the handled bottles did the trick he just loves them
"prior to this mobile, i had one of those wind-up kind. yuck! why do they even make those? i absolutely love this mobile because it goes for approx 15 minutes after turning on. that is enough time for my baby to relax and fall asleep. i love that the mobile is detachable, although my 7 mo old still enjoys watching the little animals go around in the circle! love the projection picture and that it shines on the mobile or on the wall / ceiling when mobile is removed. very nice that it comes with the remote, although i have yet to use it. great music and nature sounds and heartbeat sound. i would rate this as the best mobile ever! wish i would have seen it when my son was first born!"
beautiful and elegant
"this carseat is the perfect size and width to fit in most planes - we used ours on an alaskan air flight.  the person in front of our daughter was able to recline her seat with no problems.  this seat can be used in the airplane without needing the base...so that's one less thing to carry.  not too much cushioning when you compare it to our snugride 35, but my daughter didn't notice the difference."
well made couch. i really dislike some of the cheaper couches with certain types of material. i found this and its a nice mico suede. my son loves it and it holds its shape really well with him standing on it and trying to get up on our big couches. its easy to clean and seems to be well made. its very light weight and is a great size.
"my daugher is 26 months old and still sleeps in her crib (which apparently is really unusual).  we had the traditional graco pack n play when she was younger to use while traveling.  since she's grown to 34 inches we've tried a tent, air mattress, etc only to have a rotten time on vacation because she wasn't sleeping well.  for our upcoming beach trip we planned to literally take apart her crib at our home and bring it with us!  enter the joovy playard.  as you know, a child as tall as my daughter doesn't fit in a regular sized pack n play.  but with the joovy, she has plenty of room.  i debated between the joovy room 2 ultralight but it is a square foot smaller and since every inch counts with us, we went with this one and i'm so glad i did.  she can lay side to side or diagonally if she wants more space.  the sides are not super tall (compared to a child her age) but she doesn't try to climb out.  i think she likes the comforting boundaries she is used to with the crib.  we are expecting another little one in july and this is the only pack n play we will need.  when the new baby is small, it can be used as a playard or sleeping area and will definitely last until their twos if needed.  if i had to do it all over again, i would just buy the joovy.  yeah, it's heavy but so is our other pack n play and it's not nearly as big.  great buy!  thanks joovy!"
the crib looks as classy as the pics. the quality of the wood is high and design is simple but elegant. i can't wait to see it turn into a bed. i am not sure how easy it was to set up because my husband and brother-in-law put it up while i wasn't around but it couldn't have been complicated.<br /><br />very nice crib.
"my daughter is almost 2 now and i still love this car seat. she is still rear facing without difficulty. its nice to turn the car seat sideways to load her in. it fits nicely in my small, compact car."
vehicle i installed this car seat in:  2013 mazda cx-9<br /><br />car seat color: waverly-chose the brown color because it matched my car interior and because of the reviews stating the black/gray got hot in the sun.<br /><br />installation: britax has a bunch of videos on youtube showing exactly how to install this car seat and i highly recommend watching them before your seat arrives.  it made installation a snap!  if you have an older vehicle (pre 2008) i would watch the videos before ordering the seat to make sure you have the components in your vehicle to install this correctly.<br /><br />thoughts:  we own the chicco keyfit 30 and have nothing but high praise for it.  the switch to this car seat was easy and my daughter loves it. it has plenty of padding around the buckle and on the shoulders. the velcro to hold the straps to the side is a nice touch and helps with loading a bit (the velcro could be an inch thicker though).  i would also recommend getting a seat cover to prevent seat marks or rubbing.
"nephew loves riding along with the girl this way.  it's a nice, easy low weight addition to the stroller.  i say buy it.  would likely also be great for an older sibling, i'll let you know on that score in a couple of years."
"i really like this swaddle.  not only are the designs cute, but the material kept our daughter very warm when we took her to the snow.  no cold toes or hands with this swaddle and she didn't overheat in this either."
easy to use for formula or snacks. i iike these better then the ones you find in most baby stores because the components are not connected and therefore cannot mix. also very convenient that the opening fits right into a regular bottle so you can shake the pre-measured formula right in without any mess.
i always have one of these bags in my diaper bag at all times and they don't take up much space.  they especially came in handy when we were on a road trip and were about 3 hours away from our destination - with clothes wet from a diaper leak.  these bags also hold up well after washing!
"i think this very good baptism gift.i bought it for nephew of my husband. this frame for picture looks no cheap. good price,good quality."
i have many brands in my stash and this has been our favorite for the past 17 months. as other brands have failed i will replace with the easy fit to keep up my stash for baby #2.
"these burp cloths are soft, cute and they deal with the drool with no problems.  i received my first set as a gift and loved them so much, i bought more!"
i love it! thank you:) it's exactly what i expected it to do. very very comfortable:) love it! love it!!
"i have not used it yet, but considering the regular bottles, i'm pretty sure i'll like it also.<br />a satisfied grandma!"
My son loves his Wubbanub!! He is not a pacifier kid but he will take this one. Love that I can always locate it and it's so cute.
"If you need a nighttime binky, this is it for sure.  This keeps her little hands busy and gives her something to hold onto for that secure feeling instead of having those arms flail around.  I have a hundred pictures of her with this already.  I wish I could get different levels of binkies (6month etc) in the Wubbanub.  I only want her to have this at naptime or at night.  I dont take this everywhere.  I only purchased one but have friends that purchased 2 of the same so they can wash/clean one while the other is used."
I bought this as a gift for a friend who recently had a baby boy and it did not disappoint!  It's adorable and hilarious!
"My twins will only take the soothie pacifiers but they don't stay in very well. These are the perfect solution. We have a red dog, penguin, puppy and this bull. They are easy for tiny hands to hold onto. They are also great for younger babies to find and put the pacifier back in their mouths on their own at a much earlier age. My babies also love the comfort of the stuffed animal. We love them."
"These are the only pacifiers I could get my baby to take.  They are also the kind attached to the Wub-a-nubs, which I highly recommend.  These we use for backup when we forget the Wub-a-nub."
This has been the best thing ever. We have five different ones. Highly recommend.  One for all floors and cars.  Safe and adorable
"Hey everyone has their problems and our just happens to be that we still use a binky to calm ourselves. The MAM works for adults so well -it's got to work great for kids too right? WELL not so fast, our screaming, burping, puking baby won't take a MAM so we're stuck with the hospital SOOTHIE binky ... until we found this one. He will take this one and helps SO much with the screaming. In fact, it has worked so well I don't have a screaming problem any more. Now I'm left to search out products that will help with the burping and puking.<br />My only con with this binky is that if you tether it to the baby the only place to do so is by the holes in the front of the binky. These can touch the cheeks of my little on an during vigorous binky sessions it can cause irritation. The binky's that I use have a pull ring so I don't have to worry about this problem."
We have a special needs son and this turtle was easy for him to grasp and hold on to. He loves it.
The monkey is my son's favorite wubbanub.  We have several as they are all that he will use.  Just love them.
Our daughter really likes these. We also have the puppy and they have been very handy.  I would purchase these again.
"I bought my grandson 3 of these and they were perfect from the time he was born until he stopped needing a pacifier, these are great - so much easier for them to hold!  These are really durable, he was tough on them and they never fell apart.  I bought one for a friend's shower and she just loves it for her baby!"
"I think this was a brilliant idea! Babies not only like the pacifier, but the limbs of the animals help out during teething. I also think that by chewing and sucking on the limbs and not just the pacifier will help when it's time to say good bye to the paci."
"they stack nicely and are easy to open and close which is great, so often baby food containers are hard to open and close. these are a good buy."
these travel caps are great. we had thrown out the originals for some reason when we first got the bottle set so its nice they sell replacement ones.
"i love this dogie, it's the cutest squeaky toy ever! baby loves it too. it's super soft and squeaks when squeezed and it's really adorable. i love everything about it."
this toddler bed is awesome!  my granddaughter is almost 3 years old and she just loved her new bed!  she outgrew the pack & play and this was a perfect option.
we love this blanket.  we've been using it every night for the past several weeks for our son who is three months old now.  it is easy to wrap and effective in keeping his arms from startling him during sleep.  very happy to have purchased this.
this is the bestt bubble maker ever.  my daughter loves it.. nothing is wrong with it.  batteries are required and you can make extra bubble solution your self if you have to once the other one runs out.  great buy.
"i love this wrap!  my son get hot very easily, so i chose this wrap to be able to use on a daily basis - so far, whenever we use it, he's very happy in it and doesn't overheat!  the only thing is, this isn't the same size as a moby wrap, it's a little shorter..."
"i bought this couch for my nephews second birthday and he absolutely loved it! it is a weird kind of material and it is hard to clean, but other than that its perfect!"
it was exactly what i expected. really simple and easy to use. i have used it daily with no issues.
this small animal is great for my 3 month old to hold on to allow her to find her pacifier on her own.
"These pacifiers are soo cool.  I have triplets, so I've gotten over 8 of them! They are soft, you can throw it in the washer and let it air dry!  People love them! they are too cute!"
"I think this was a brilliant idea! Babies not only like the pacifier, but the limbs of the animals help out during teething. I also think that by chewing and sucking on the limbs and not just the pacifier will help when it's time to say good bye to the paci."
"brilla en la oscuridad cuando mas necesitas encontrarlo, tiene un tamao ideal y trae tapa, es perfecto para mi bebe."
I got this item for a baby shower and I was not disappointed when it arrived. It made the perfect baby gift and I would recommend it for anyone with a baby or one on the way!
this is my favorite style of these bowls (i think i have them all!). the two compartments are perfect for apple slices in one side and peanut butter for dipping in the other. or for veggies and dip or whatever duo your child prefers. love the rubber bottoms. keeps the bowls in place. very nice quality. they have been through the dishwasher many times and still look good.
"i love how much space this gives my precious baby! all the other playpen s were so expensive and tacky colored. black never goes out of style and this was perfectly priced! now i have a safe place for my little mover while i wash dishes, vacuum, etc! a perfect buy for stay at home moms!"
"a little pricey but my son would only use this kind whenever he got a bottle, since he doesn't get a bottle very regularly."
"my cousin bought me the gumdrop bottle set for my baby and gave it to me at my baby shower. it was the set that came with the small pack of pacifier wipes. let me just say they are great. they smell good and although i am unsure if they taste good, they get his pacifier's clean and he seems to have no trouble with the taste when we stick the pacifiers back in his mouth. i actually use them to clean all the things he puts in his mouth like when we're on the go and don't have water or soap i use them for his bottles. i think they are great and bought this one because i was scared that once we'd run out of the smaller pack we wouldn't have any left to clean his pacifiers with. i also use the smaller pack for on-the-go so i store them in his diaper bag and this set we keep at home so we always have some with us when we need them."
"i really love this bottle rack. its so handy! not only does it look nice on the kitchen counter, but it allows the bottles & all of the pieces to dry completly. no more wet handtowels on the counter, where the bottles never really dry the whole way! it just snapped together. i bought it on a thursday & it came the next day! it's really nice, does the job & what a great value! i'll use it for sippy cups too when that time comes! i suggest any parent to order this. it's nice!"
"we were contemplating getting a baby bullet but had read some bad reviews. we purchased this based on all the rave reviews and we were not disappointed. it's easy to use, clean and its compact size doesn't take up too much room in the kitchen."
"i wasn't sure i needed a video monitor, but went ahead and purchased this one anyway.  it might be one of the best baby purchases we made.  i've been using it for about 4 months and it's been fantastic.  good range, good sound and picture quality.  no complaints.  for the price it's a no brainer!"
it is great for my baby's clothes. love the color and it goes well with the crib from same place.
what a great teether.  my daughter gravitates towards this teether over all others.  i think she likes the head nubs and nose on her gums.  plus it is so cute to watch her &#34;eating&#34; such an adorable giraffe!  will be buying these for gifts!
"i have previously had a similar rocker and glad i bought it again..item was received on april 12, which was quicker than anticipated, which is fantastic."
"good product, it's quite simple to use and not much to say about it as there is no real space for anthing to go wrong really. if you have dr brown bottles then this works great."
my friend plans on cloth diapering her kiddo and i thought these monkeys were adorable so i bought a pair :)
"we never get any smell and we keep it just for pooped diapers. it is easy to use, practical, compact and nice."
"these are so soft (and only get softer with each laundering). my daughter loves these and i felt good about letting her have them in the crib from about 6 months onward because they are so sheer (thus not a suffocation hazard). the only thing i don't love about them is that they are very big. because they are thin, i worried a little about the possibility that my daughter could get one wrapped around her neck."
i love this pad! when it arrived it was a lot bigger than i anticipated.  it is actually longer than the changing table we bought but because of the safety straps it doesn't pose a safety risk
"i'm a mother of 4. i have been through my share of bibs. it is only on my 4th that i have discovered these. i hate velcro bibs. they snag baby's neck, snag my laundry, and wake my baby up when he's sleeping and i'm trying to get it off. most bibs out there have some cutsie design on them that causes the bib to not absorb the milk or spit and it just dribbles off. these bibs are perfect. they are large, but still fit on my newborn from day one. love the 3 adjustable snaps, love that they are on the side and not behind his head, and the material so so soft and absorbent. not to mention, cute designs that do not say \\i love mommy\\ on them. wouldn't change a thing."
these are the best sippy cups i have found. the twist on easily. don't have trouble leaking. bpa free and dishwasher safe!
"We received an orange pacifier from the hospital while we were staying there. I couldn't find these in any stores in Canada, anything that came close covered her nose and she would push them out of her mouth. We ordered these online to make sure we have backups in case we ever lose the one from the hospital. They are wonderful!"
The AVENT Soothie pacifer is awesome. We got our in the hospital and my baby has been using them ever since. He is 15 mths old now and still using the 0-3 mths paci (now only for nap time). We tried the ones for older babies but he prefers the 0-3 mth one. The only con I would say is that it can not be clipped to a paci holder... although I did here they are now making some of them to fit.
"These pacifiers have proven to be lifesavers. We have multiples, and once your baby loves them you'll be buying multiples too! We have used these since leaving the hospital, and therefore avoided baby waking up in the middle of the night due to losing her pacifier. They stay in because the stuffed animal helps them stay close to their mouth instead of falling out as soon as they stop sucking. As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes. This is why I recommend more than one, so you can wash one and have a back up for baby. The elephant was great due to the big ears, she loves to pull on those. We constantly have other parents asking about this pacifier....once you have one you'll be a believer."
"so happy with these mitts, stay on the hands yet are not constrictive.  they are also really soft which is nice because she rubs her hands on her face a lot.  i would recommend them and consider giving them as gifts in the future"
i purchased this glider to have when my granddaughter comes to visit. it is very easy to assemble and can be  folded up for travel situations. i thought that it would go through batteries quickly because it requires 4 d batteries. i have used about 8 times and it is still going strong. even with the glider going and the overhead toys turning and music playing; can't beat it for the price.
"this is the best baby/kid body wash! i love the smell of this wash, it is so clean and crisp. also it does not have the harmful chemicals that some of the other baby washes have. i have used burts bees and i like the way this wash cleans my child, and how it smells a lot better. also the pump is a must when you have a more mobile baby/kid. it is easy to get out with one hand. i recommend this product to anyone with a kid."
"i put this together by myself in an hour, the instructions were simple and it was a breeze. it's super sturdy and looks beautiful with the rest of my oak furniture :)"
this is so handy to have in my bag.  i find it so convenient to have everything in one area.
the first teething toy we found that our 6 month old will use and loves to chew on. i would recommend.
"oh i love these for ,y daugther, the material is great soft and they wash really well. i have to buy more"
"what can i say it a must have with car seats, this product it as good as what you could purchase at a store. i works well."
"i was going to purchase the rattania but when i saw that this was coming out, i decided to wait.  i'm so glad i did.  it looks great and is very easy to clean.  my little one is also very comfortable in it. great purchase!"
"we love this high chair. it is very sturdy, love the harness system and move-ability of this chair. our little girl loves sitting in this chair, very reasonably priced for what you get in the box."
"this crib was bought for sleep-over grandbabies, but it is sturdy enough for your baby's room.  great to store away for later use."
"this is a great aroma therapy toy. it heats up and lays perfectly next to my child while they sleep. it's just enough warmth so that i can fool them into thinking that they are snuggling me ;). the only downside here is that my son wanted to play with it and it's long and heavy so he got frustrated during the day time. at night though, it's the perfect companion."
cute little pink monkey that feels great and matches the rest of the set. hopefully she will like it as much as i do.
"these training pants are essentially very thick, absorbent undies.<br /><br />material:  the fabric is very, very soft and feels high-quality.  the stretchy waist and leg openings are also very soft, not binding or itchy.  the inner layer is almost fleecy/fuzzy, but it doesn't pill like fleece does.  the colors stay bright.  the photo shown here of the giraffe print is totally accurate -- it's a bright, happy orangey-yellow print on bright white.<br /><br />absorbency:  these are halfway between underwear and diaper.  there is no waterproof layer, but since they are thicker than undies, they can hold a bit of moisture.  a little pee dribble will stay contained, but the child will feel wet.  a full-on pee will soak the training pants and run onto the floor.  so, be prepared -- don't let your kid wear these on grandma's fancy sofa unless you are very, very confident.<br /><br />fit:  these fit great.  i would say that they run true to size or a little bit small.  if in doubt, definitely size up!"
"for some reason the top reviews for this sheet are terrible! i got these sheets very quickly, took them out to wash and dry, and put them on the crib and they fit perfectly. i have a sealy crib mattress with a quilted crib pad underneath and these did not tear, did not need to be overly stretched and are so soft!"
"my wife and i love this gate! it's simple to install and use. we get comments from our friends all the time about how good it looks. it can be portable if you so desire, but it's really intended to be semi-permanent via four recessed cups that scew into a door frame or wall stud and hold the pressure pads in a spot of your choosing.<br /><br />overall: i highly recommend this product."
this product is beautiful and better than i expected.  it is well made and i have recommended this product to my friends for the excellent quality of this product.  it is a must buy and well worth the amount i paid for it.  i am extremely pleased with this product and will buy again from this seller due to the quality  of the product :)

"i purchased the frames to decorate my baby girl's nursery. i love that they match almost any background color (especially pastels in every tone like pink, peach, green, yellow etc.)! in my case, my baby's nursery is a very delicate light peach color and the frames look absolutely beautiful with it. they are exactly as described, not too small or big, just the right size to decorate a wall. the only con i could find is that they have a strong odor when you first take them out of the package. other than that, well worth the purchase."
"it's pretty comfortable. i'm a big woman and i've passed out on it whilst reading to my kid a few times already. my 6-year-old loves it too. it did set me back, so i bought a bed bug cover, but no extra padding or anything special to make it softer, and i have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about that it's too hard. it's firm, as it should be.<br /><br />here is something to know: when i first got it, i wasn't sure if it should have these weird black flecks all over the mattress. the answer is yes. i called naturepedic to ask. the cotton is unbleached, and you will see wheaty and black flecks that look kind of ew. but it beats the hell out of toxins, imo.<br /><br />delivery was fine. two guys came and delivered on a saturday (because the delivery service calls to arrange a time you'll be home), and they were pretty flexible. the box was beat up, but on the inside, the bed was clean, in a factory sealed bag, with all the tags and warranty stuff. so it worked out fine to order something so huge in the mail.<br /><br />i can't imagine regretting having bought my kid a non-toxic mattress. seems worth the price and the hassle of going out of my way to buy it."
was replacing my daughters old model that sounded like the falls with so much static.i was wondering about this one and was blown away at how clear and quiete it is.i used it to keep in touch with my wife upstais and it was a great help.she has passed now so i will retire them for a while but it was fantastic while i used them
this is such a great way to travel..<br />its easy to take and carry with you on a plane.<br />love it.
use it for my elderly grandpas bed works like a charm ordering 2 more this week it saves me from changing the sheets twice a day highly recommend this product
"I originally only got this because I liked the idea of a pacifier that would be harder to lose/easier for baby to grab and put in. I didn't expect my daughter to become so attached to it! It doesn't stay in perfectly, but a lot better than just a paci by itself, and you can swaddle it up inside a blanket to help secure it even more. My baby loved to hold it while she sucked on the pacifer and even when she stopped taking pacifiers altogether at about 2 1/2 months, she still loves this giraffe. She holds it while she sleeps, in the car, and now that she has started teething she loves to chew on his legs and horns. Great buy for as happy as it makes her!"
Nothing to say just a funny novelty to give to my baby brother. Is hilarious to watch him around the house with it in
"This is the only pacifier my baby will take. I like the different sizes for the different ages. Says it's ok for the teeth, i guess I'll see in 5 years :)"
Who doesn't love a Bad Ass Baby? This is super cute! I recommend it for all babies. Babies shouldnt be limited to pastels.
My grandson loves his WubbaNub.  He snuggles his ducky and chews on the pacifier.  He does not use the pacifier much any more but he loves to snuggle the soft duck.  I have another grandbaby on the way.  There will be another WubbaNub in our future.  The problem will be finding one that the older baby does not want to steal.
"Great way to make a soothie even better! I wanna buy some more of those. Pricey tho! Cute, fun and baby loves it!"
We love our froggie Wubanub! It is so cute but beyond that it is so functional! It does not bounce or roll into the great beyond when dropped or spit out. It is easy to find in a paci emergency! Our little guy could hold it with his arm weeks before his mother skills developed enough to let him use his hand for the task. We get compliments and questions whenever we go out (froggie is always with us!) I always recommend Wubanub to my mommy and grand parent friends. The only issue would be if your little one does not like the Soothie pacis but mine loves it so no problem.
haha little baby on the way well this is the perfect binky for the baby! people will laugh and it is just awesome! :)
"we love this booster seat for our son! he was 19 months when we got it for him, and he loves sitting at the table with us! he seems very comfortable in his seat, and loves climbing up into his seat for meals! the straps to keep him securely in his seat is a big plus for us! i also like that with this booster, i can push him up to the table, so he is close to his plate. while with his old booster seat...due to the arm height, he would have a huge gap between the table and himself. the chair can almost be pushed in completely when he is done eating as well. this booster is very easy to clean! i wipe it down after every meal and use my vacuum attachment to suck up crumbs that may fall into the holes by the straps. i would definitely recommend this seat to everyone! it was the perfect buy for us!"
"i love it and my baby love it to<br />i am going to buy other ,good quality,i recommend this product"
this is such a great gate or stairs!  i love the fact it swings open for the nature length of the door and there is no bar on the bottom! the lock is simple for parents but i can see why kids would have a difficult mid with it.  i can easily open it while holding the baby.
bought this for a friend and she loved it... looks large but its thin but hey its hello kitty.. shipped fast
bought this chair for a two and a half year old who was sitting unsafely on a barstool and it has been an easy transition.  the chair has not been difficult to clean.  we chose a dark color so that it would not stain.  it is as beautiful of a chair as you would hope it would be for the money.
i bought this as a baby shower gift for a friend who had a mustache themed baby shower for her baby boy. definitely cute!
i bought this as part of an amazon.com baby registry.  mom-to-be couldn't be happier!  she's so excited to have baby close by and know that this item is strong and sturdy enough to ease her fears (first time mom!!)
"just what I wanted to give.I am sure the new parents will love it, because pacifiers are always dropping from their mouths."
Gave as a gift - the family loved it - -appears to be well made - no comment on quality / usefulness as they haven't yet used it - 6 month pacifier.
"LOVE these pacifiers!  We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!"
"Our son used these from day one at the hospital.  When our daughter was born, he still had the green ones from the hospital so in order to avoid him from taking the new baby's, we ordered pink & purple for her.  Much cheaper to purchase in the multipack than from a store (only comes in a 2pk for around $5 and every parent knows that when you need them most they all have disappeared...so good to have a few backups."
"Was given these by labor & delivery when I had my son. Already had some other types at home, but he loves these! Will not take another type. One piece construction and no hard parts. Easy to clean, great for him to teeth on, ordered a bunch and will keep ordering until we ween him off of them."
These are the best. They do not leave marks on baby's face and the rubber is good when baby is teething
This is a great product for kids! They are able to hold it and find it in the night! More rested nights for mommy and daddy!
My children are 17 months apart and my older child was still using the Soothies and had them in both pink and green. I was looking for a different color so I could tell them apart and was happy to have found these yellow ones on Amazon. I only wish they sold them in stores!
I got this as a gift for a sweet little girl.  My god son had one and loved it.  I think she will too!
"This came in the mail very fast. It's easy for my 4 mo old to grab, she plays with it. It's cute and everyone loves it"
"We have three wubbanubs: the monkey, dino, and the puppy. The shape of the puppy is great. It's legs are just the right size for my four month old to grab. Plus, it's precious!"
This is super cute and  I can't wait to use it on my new baby when he gets here !!
"This is my favorite of the wubbanub pacifier collection of ours.  We have the bear, dragon, dinosaur, and sea turtle.  This one is adorable, very easy for my baby to hold on to, and his go to binky.  He loves it and so do I!"
"I'm giving this 5 starts because I needed yellow pacis to decorate a  yellow, gray and black diaper cake with and amazon was the only place that had the paci in this color.  It looked gorgeous on the cake, and my son has never taken another paci besides the soothers."
It's so so cute. Hope that my baby will love it. It's looks pretty good. And it is well made.
"I think the Avent soothie is a God send.  It works like no other paci out there, so when you add a cute little &#34;stuffed animal&#34; to the end of it, who can resist??  My son wouldn't take to any other paci, but this one works like a charm, and he's now learning to hold onto the legs.  SO cute!<br /><br />Like many people know, 2012 was the year of the Golden Dragon (not just any Dragon year), one that comes every 60 years, so I had to have this paci.  I'm pretty sure the manufacturers knew this, because it can't be a coincident that it was the most expensive WubbaNub (can it?)."
"In the early months, babies do not know how to soothe themselves, and as parents, we try our best to calm them down by rocking, shushing, or singing to them.  But, when that doesn't work (assuming they've been fed, burped and have a clean diaper), try giving them a paci, and not just any paci... give them an Avent soothie.<br /><br />If hospitals are using it, chances are it's the best brand/product out there.  For the first month after my son was born, he did not take to a paci.  In some cases, that's a good thing since pacis are known to cause dental problems, but the reality is that babies do &#34;flip out&#34; and when they do... this is a life saver.<br /><br />An Avent paci is better than any other brand, but this particular one is vanilla scented - making it even better.  Another must have!"
"My son loved his soothie, so I decided to try this out. He is inseperable from it! I got it for him when he was only a few weeks old, and now at 4 months he can put the soothie in his own mouth, and is quite comfortable picking up and holding the dragon. He also strokes it's fur, and I find him hugging it in his sleep. I plan on purchasing at least one more sometime soon!"
Absolutely loved them!!!  My little boy absolutely who is 5 months old really loves it. The pacifer attachment is a real life saver too!
You just cant have enough pacifiers in the crib so the child can find them in the night time.  Good quality.
I have never had any of my babies have nipple confusion with these. I have given them to all three of my kids-also they have all spit them out by about 3 months and never wanted another paci after that...could be luck but I like to think it was this awesome pacifier!
This is the only pacifier that my 2 month old son will take. All other pacifiers we use he immediately spits out. I have absolutely no complaints about this product and highly recommend it to all.
"We have 3 different ones, and I want more! They are so easy for my child to find at night an pop in his mouth. Not to mention adorable! One day I saw him put the entire (no wubbabnub attached) binky in his mouth! yikes! so I will not ever give him a non wubbanub binky again! They are safer and too cute!"
wish my daughter would've liked them. she didn't like ANY pacifiers. she's almost 1 now and we gave up. at least we don't have to worry about her not wanting to let go.
"These are the best pacifiers on the market.  They are the ones the hospital sent home with us and my son is attached!  No other binky will work for him.  They are soft and durable.  Yes, they bounce when dropped, just buy some pacifier wipes or a wubbanub and you are good to go."
Our theme is monkey's so it's perfect that way and it's really cute but it also helps the baby keep the pacifier in and not just spit it out so my baby loves it and so do we.
"very good , product was original and ok , whell packed , good box , new in the box , i recomend tanks"
"It seemed like I was always searching for pacis for my ten month old son, so I finally caved in and bought eight at once.  We've been very happy with them.  Nuk pacis have been my favorite with both of my children.  The shape helps it stay in the baby's mouth, which is particularly nice at night.  The sports theme (which I'm not usually a big fan of) adds a sweet boyish flair to baby's daily ensemble.  No complaints about this purchase!"
ALL I CAN SAY IS THESE THINGS REALLY SUCK! THE BABY LOVES THEM! HOW MUCH HAPPINESS  CAN A LITTLE THING LIKE THIS BRING! IT IS TERRIFIC [I GUESS]
I got a few different Wubbanub characters for my nephew and the giraffe is his FAVORITE! its perfect for him to grab himself and he also enjoys chewing on the giraffes legs :)
I had several friends who were having babies within months of each other.  I bought 2 blue pacifiers and 2 pink ones and each mother thought they were great!
"Being a first time grandma & kept thinking about how many receiving blankets I rolled up to keep my own baby's pacifier in place, what an awesome idea!  Baby granddaughter loves to hold soft furry meow and gets all her comfort at same time.  Buy at least three!"
"My 2 month old son loves his wubbanubs, not to mention how convenient they are for me as well. I was constantly picking up and having to wash his other pacifiers because whenever they fell out they were gone. However with the wubbanub it stays on his chest and he is able to grab it again with his mouth whenever it falls out. He also loves to hold the animal which is a great thing at this age of development! Love this product!!!!"
"We got this Stachifier after seeing my little one's cousin with one. We couldn't resist. Not only do we get a kick out of seeing him in it, but he loves seeing himself in the mirror with it. He just cracks up! I will be purchasing the other styles for sure!"
"I like this dragon it's a good size and perhaps when my grand baby is a little older will be more attracted to it, it's a good size and colorful"
"My son has chubby cheeks and these wont put a mark on his face . love the product , they are made in England ."
"Wubbanubs are the only pacifiers that our son would take, and now they are a go-to gift for me with new parents.  My son sucked on the paci, the legs, the tag... Perfect."
They are soft and comfortable. i like that the shape is designed to create a comfort fit around baby's mouth.  My newborn loves them and amazon has multi pack at a great price.
Makes a really cute gift! Gave this to my finance in a &#34;new daddy&#34; basket at the hospital and he loved it!
I Used the pacifiers on a diaper cake along with the silverware.  They were a nice finishing touch.to the cake.
"Thank you. I was so upset when this product was pulled from local stores. My little one has outgrown it now but it gave piece of mind when she was too big for a small paci and put the entire thing in her mouth,  yet wouldn't fall asleep without something. It was a great bridge for going from paci to no paci."
I bought this pacifier for my son before he was born. I took it with me to the hospital when I went into labor. The child was attached to it as soon we offered it to him. It's easy to find and you can just throw it in the washer. I ordered him similar ones it but he prefers this on.  He's four and half months now and this is the second one I buy him.
MY BABY GIRL WAS BORN 12 WEEKS EARLY AND THESE ARE GOING TO BE GREAT WHEN SHE IS READY TO COME HOME!!!!!
"I bought this product for my newborn grandson (who wasn't keen on his 'regular' pacifier), having seen my other grandchildren loving their Natursutten pacifier. The shape seems to suit the baby's mouth & helps soothe them almost instantly when they are fractious. I would recommend this product to others without hesitation."
This adorable giraffe has a functional design.  I'm told this is a must have for babies! Cant wait to find out!!!
I love this product. My son will only take a soothie pacifier but he has a hard time keeping it in on his own. This solved that problem. Now he even holds onto it and pets the puppy as he's falling asleep:)
This has taught our daughter to reach and grab for her pacifiers and return them to her mouth! Great for car rides because i can always locate it. I have bought these for friends and have a whole assortment for my daughter!
This was a shower gift for a true Cowboy fans first baby! He Loved It !!! It was a real crowd pleaser and seems to please the baby too !!
"We thought a pacifier pocket was an unnecessary item before we had our first baby, but quickly realized it would be much nicer to have one than not to. Having this attached to our diaper bag sure beat wrapping our baby's pacifier in a small towel and sticking it in there!<br /><br />What I like about this particular one is that it's simple, sleek, cute, and is the perfect touch to my skip hop diaper back in the black onyx design. It also goes well with our skip hop wipes holder/dispenser in white with the red dot. We love this!"
I bought this for a baby shower gift. It was perfect since it's not a common product to find in stores. It was a hit and I'm glad I bought it.
Aside it being adorable I can easily find it. Now that my baby is six months he shakes the monkey around too cute.
"I bought this because of its great reviews and was not disappointed.  It's easy to use and beats several little squirts of medicine that inevitably come out of her mouth.  It can bee kind of hard to close, but once you figure it out, it's not so bad.  Medicine can come out a little fast...  Haven't tried with the syringe yet...  My baby is 12 weeks old."
So cute and my 3 month old daughter loves it.  I am going to buy a couple more of them!!
My granddaughter loves it. Love it. This is exactly what I was looking for. I am sure it will serve me well for many years.
my son absolutely loves this.  It is the only pacifier he will use.  He uses it as something to cuddle with.  Only problem is he won't take any other pacifiers and we have to bring this everywhere we go.
I love this pacifier & so does my little one.  I guess he loves all the attention he gets when he has this in his mouth.  People are always doing a double take as they pass us by and then start to giggle. I use a paci clip that you can attach to the little holes on either side of the pacifier so my son doesn't lose it.
"The soothie pacifier we received from the hospital is the only one my baby will take, but he's always losing it in his carseat when I can't stop and give it back to him.  The Wubbanub is perfect because it gives him the paci he loves and allows him to hold his 'toy' and he's learning to put it back in his mouth by himself."
"The soothie pacifier we got at the hospital is the only one my little guy will take, but he constantly loses it in his carseat.  The Wubbanub allows him to enjoy the paci he loves while giving him a 'toy' to cling to...he's learning to put it back in his mouth on his own."
Everything was perfect until they arrived. The only complaint I have is the color. I know it says colors may vary but I purchased for a boy and both were pink. I was hoping to get at least one suitable for a boy.
My doula recommended these and we love them. We have ordered several more including glow in the dark ones!!  A great buy.
My son loves his wubanub. He can grasp it easily. It' soft. We take it everywhere we go. Helps at night.
These are the best pacifiers for the best price.  She started using these shortly after she was born.  They have a hole at the bottom that we can use to put a pacifier hook/string on. She likes to put her fingers in the holes.  These are the best.  There is no need to spend more money on the expensive pacifiers.  Our little 13 month old just started to bite through her pacifiers (she has 15 teeth) so we are replacing them now.
I purchased this for my daughter as my 15 month old grandson did not like his temperature being taken. This thermometer works great. I can't say my grandson now loves having his temperature taken but this makes the chore much easier and quicker
"Love the wubbanubs!  My son has the monkey and we thought we'd get a second one just in case we lose it.  So, we got him this dragon because he was born in the Year of the Dragon.  He loves it and the arms and legs are long enough to tuck under the seat belt of his carseat."
"These are the absolute best pacifiers ever. They are similar to the soothie pacifiers, but these ones are softer, making them better for newborns and easier for them to keep in their mouths."
Safety first has made giving meds much easer for your little ones. No one wants to hold down a child and try and spoon the meds into a closed mouth. Now with this little pacifier you don't have to do that. Most babies are used to a pacifier and will just take it right away. The most unique to give meds. Way to go Safety First you rock.
"I think these pacifiers are perfect. But I think anyone with kids knows that anyone can say whatever they want about a pacifier, it all depends on what your child likes.  But these are durable and colorful and safe."
"This is the best idea ever, my son is 4 months old and he loves his pacifier but still so small and has a hard time keeping it in his mouth, but with this nifty thing he keeps it in his mouth. When I would be riding in the front seat I would have to reach my arm into the back seat and hold the pacifier in his mouth almost the whole ride by the time we reached our destination I couldn't feel my arm. Now I just lay one of these on his chest and even if he falls asleep it doesn't fall out of his mouth so if he starts trying to suck again it's still right there for him."
These are major lifesavers when it comes to keeping your infant asleep when needed! They are durable and convienient. Even after the pacifier stage they have a stuffed animal for comfort.
Great delivery time and product was in perfect condition. This helps with keeping the binkey in my newborn's mouth or at least in close enough range to where he can get to it.
I haven't gotten to use it yet. Purchased for my future granddaughter. I believe both baby and mother will love. It looks exactly like the photo
We were looking for a pacifier for our 6 month old that was ok for a growing mouth and this did the trick. She uses it only at night but it fits her mouth well.
It looks just as cute as in the picture. Haven't gotten to use it yet. Purchased for my daughter who is expecting a baby girl. I think they will both will be pleased with it.
"It is great to have this used instead of fingers or thumbs since it can be taken away later. This pacifier really seems to help with the teething. We actually put one in the freezer and then give it to the baby when he is teething. It works. We have tried a different pacifier and he did not even want it.<br />Now that he is old enough to hold his pacifier, he also takes it out and sometimes teethes on the side of the pacifier."
"My grandson has this same monkey as his favorite stuffed animal except this is smaller.  When I found this Monkey Wubbanub on amazon, I had to get it for him.  He loves it!  It is so nice to have a pacifier attached to something.  It is rarely on the floor.  I bought this for him when he was 3 months old and he's 51/2 months now and he still loves it!"
"My Boy Loves His Wubbanub Pacifier, he enjoys the dragon so much, just wish it was easier to clean or sanitize."
"i love it if baby loves it. Nothing like a plug to satisfy little sweetie when he's fussing, and this one seems to do the trick."
"My wife like them more than the baby himself. But he really likes them too, because he spends hours sucking them, unless he's hungry and spit them out."
"My grandchildren absolutely adore their Wubbanubs.  They give the child tactile comfort, as each one is very soft and plush.  Also it gives the child something to hold onto as they utilize it.  I'd recommend all varieties of this product.  This one is a gift for Easter, but, another favorite is the giraffe."
Recently purchased this for a friend's new baby.  He is three weeks old and previously wouldn't take a pacifier.  She gave him this and he contently kept it in for over an hour!
"A great gift for the newborn - and their parents!  If you don't know what to give, this will do it!"
This style of pacifier ended up being our first child's favorite &#34;binky&#34;.  We were not able to attach it to the standard clips so we spent lots of time chasing it around and then cleaning it whenever it dropped on the ground.  I saw someone with a WubbaNub after my first child had given up pacifiers.  I made sure to buy two of these for my second child and he loved it.  It gives them something to cuddle and hang on to while they suck away.<br /><br />I recommend these for any parent open to pacifiers.
My grandson loves the wubbanubs that he has and I am sure he will love this one that I will put in his Easter basket
I purchased these for my granddaughter who isn't here yet.I'm sure she'll gets lots of use out them.They look like they would be the right size for a newborn.
My son uses this pacifier daily. The skull has NOT rubbed off like some of the other reviews stated and I wash it several times a day so I would say it's good quality. The nipple is similar to a Nuk pacifiers.
These are just such a great invention!<br /><br />The materials is so soft and it's a nice color.<br />Baby likes to hold it and &#34;pet&#34; it - it seems to relax her.  She's teething and will sometimes gnaw on the feet or ears of the elephant - it's held up very well to this.<br /><br />Would recommend
My grandson has every wubba nub made and this one just added to his collection and he loved it.  Very pleased.
My granddaughter loves it. She can hold it to place the pacifier in her mouth----- a great idea. She also has a lamb.
My uncle told me about these binkys and I'm glad he did cu they are awesome thank you and I highly reccomend this seller an brand
"We have several of these and continue to buy them for family members.  Great for new babies to keep the nuk in by just setting the animal on a blanket.  Great for toddlers because they put their own nuk in.  Easy clean, just throw in the washer and dryer.  Once there cracked just cut off the nuk and you have a toy still.  Win, Win."
These straps worked great for us during a recent vacation. They also work well on our son's highchair and stroller. Great buy.
My son will be teething soon and thus far he has rejected every brand of pacifier that we have tried. The GumDrop is well made with good quality silicone. It fits my son's face perfectly and leaves room for his little nose to breathe. He prefers licking on it and chewing rather than sucking... but at least he isn't spitting it out! I ordered a vanilla one as well and he seems to prefer that one over the unscented.
This is a great gift for newborns.  They love to hold on to the animal! A timesaver for new parents!
"My daughter loves her WubbaNub. It's the perfect size for her tiny (4 mo) hands and it's soft enough for baby cuddles. The paci on the end is great. My only concern would be how to clean it properly, but paci wipes work well for now. I'm sure the body is washable I just haven't needed to find out (yet)"
We ordered this product specifically for the type of pacifier it had but found that the combination was excellent.  My grandson loves his so much we had to buy a second one so we could wash the original one once in a while.<br />Thank you!
"Our daughter is obsessed with her wubba. In fact so, we now have 3 of them for all areas of the house. I know they are a bit pricey for a pacifier, but worth every penny. She can even find it at night in her crib easily to self soothe!"
We bought the wubbunub so it would stay on our sons chest while he was in his car seat. It didn't really work for that until he was around 3 months. Then the wubbunub became his best friend!!! It was a security blanket and binky all in one. The best part is that it has the soothie pacifier on it (which was the brand he loved).<br />Pros:<br />- Easy to find in a bag because its bigger than a regular binky.<br />- Easy for a baby to find when they want their binky.<br />- Easy to wash: I just threw it in the wash when I washed his clothes.<br />- You can easily seam rip the binky off when you're ready to wean the binky and your child can still have their security toy.
My son has always loved the paci he got from the hospital. And so we're thrilled that it's available in store and on Amazon.
The elephant wubbanub is perfect for every little girl. it's always easy to find and is easy for the kiddos to hold on to. I would recommend.
What can I say my daughter after coming from the hospital just fell in love with this style of pacifier and doesn't want anything else. Shipping was quick and the price was excellent!
"great for the price, my baby loves this ones, now I have plenty of them. Thank you for a great pacifier"
Love these things :)  I don't know what I would do without them.  My daughter loves them also.  They are easy for her to put in her mouth if she drops it.
"Our son had used the silicon pacifiers previously, until we discovered this natural rubber pacifier. I was nervous that he would reject them because he had been using the other ones for almost a year. He took to them, to my surprise and happiness, without a single problem! We love them!!"
"I brought this for my 1mo old grandaughter because she is always grabbing and reaching for things, mainly her face. This worked wonders:) Perfect and Adorable!!!!"
"My son was born in 2012- year of the dragon, so this was perfect!  It's absolutely adorable and very detailed with the cute blue wings which is ideal for a boy."
These are just like the ones that they give you at the hospital. But there are no more smooshed noses LOL
"I will buy one of these WubbaNubs for every baby shower in my future.  My baby prefers the soothie style pacifier but could not hold it in her mouth on her own.  The turtle holds it in for her, or nearby, so she can replace it in her mouth when it falls out.  Also the  plushie is great for practicing holding onto toys and using hand muscles.  She sometimes likes to chew or suck on the plush part, so it gives a variety of textures for baby's development."
This was the perfect gag gift for my sis in law. It's really an inside joke but i could not pass it up. A little on the high side in price. If they sold it in stores would be much more worth it but cute and funny served the purpose.
I love this binky! I bought this binky because my daughter had a rash around her mouth from other pacifiers and saw this which did not touch her face at all....and within 2 days the rash was gone. Now my baby has her safety blanket and her beautiful face back.
"the best pacifiers for babies. my younger 2 only took these as bitty babies.  its hard to attach paci-catchers to these without an adapter, but not impossible :D"
My daughter loves her WubbaNub. And it is so nice that I don't have to search for her binkie anymore.
Got this one as a present for my sister in law but my son had them when he was tiny.  They are the perfect size to fit in their hands and hold in their mouth and adorable.  I only wish you could replace the pacifier - we had a dog who liked to chew them!
I have been using the product for my son. So  am happy to be able to get it as i have not found it in my country.
My 2nd son was collicky and in desperate need to find something to soothe him I bought almost every type of pacifier I could find.  He didn't end up taking to any pacifiers but my 3rd son ended up preferring these pacifiers over all of the others.  He is breastfed and this pacifier really does seem more natural than any others I have seen.  They are flexible and gentle.  He loves them and won't take anything else.
"WubbaNubs are a genius idea! I wish I'd thought of it! And so cute! We have the elephant and the giraffe, and between the two they have saved hours of my searching under sofas and chairs for stray soothies! As soon as they arrived in the mail the soothies from the hospital when right into a drawer and have stayed there! Now that my little one is older he loves to use the soothie sideways as a teething toy, which he absolutely favors over all the other fancy teething toys I've purchased! Now if only they made some more fun animals, like a turtle or a fish, I've have a lot more!"
"Darling pacifier!  It is functional as well as precious!  I think every little, &#34;Princess In Training&#34; should have this pacifier!"
"These are our favorite, after trying a few different styles. Why?<br />* The shield curves away from the face on the whole outer edge, so this pacifier doesn't leave an imprint on our baby's face as many other pacifiers do (e.g. NUK pacifiers).<br />* Stays in her mouth better than Soothies.<br />* Comes with a cover that keeps the pacifier clean when it's stuffed in a pocket or in her diaper bag.<br />* It's reversible, unlike the NUKs, so it's never upside-down in her mouth.<br />* The loop handle makes it easier for adults to pick up. Unfortunately, it also makes it easier for our baby to pull out of her mouth by accident.<br />* BPA-free, of course."
"This arrived super quick, in good condition.  The pacifier is cute, as we ordered another one of these 2.5 years ago for our daughter.  That one has stood the test of time as it is still in one piece! My baby loves it and he is always looking for it.  Babies absolutely adore these pacifiers."
after shopping around town i noticed finding a black crib was hard. i checked online and i found this crib. i fell in love. when it arrived my husband and i set it up. i loved it even more. when family and friends walk into the nursery they always ask about the crib and talk about how strong it is compared to their cribs. i'm so glad i pick this crib.
"i love this product and i will like to purchase more of it very soon. the cover fits my baby mattress although its a little losse, it is still good for my mini mattress  and fits find. the material is great."
"just what you need if you need replacement parts. i personally didn't need as many &#34;caps,&#34; but everything else has come in handy."
"i recommend this item for any parents, easy to clean and sterilize, it is very strong and confortable for your babies."
we love this seat. we have a 2 1/2 year old and a 1 year old. we have it for both cars and the grandparents too. easy to put in and super safe!
"this bib is fantastic! our baby is a dribbler, and this bib catches every last drop.  there is a soft elastic neckline that catches everything and leaves her clothing nice and dry.  totally worth the price.  love it!"
"i ordered a set of the regular spill spoiler caps at the same time as i ordered a set of the sport caps.  i am equally pleased with both, so this review mirrors my comments on the sport caps.<br /><br />i drink nutritional drinks and energy drinks in the car and at home, and have a tendency to be a klutz and spill whatever i am drinking in the car and on the furniture.  when i happened onto the spill spoiler ad, i  ordered a set of the regular caps and a set of the sport caps.<br /><br />up-front, i will say i was very pleased to see a listing of the types and brands of bottles each cap fits.  i didn have to wonder if the cap would fit my particular drink bottle.<br /><br />upon receipt of the caps, i immediately tried them and found they do exactly what the ad says.  unscrew the drink regular cap, screw on the spill spoiler cap, stick in a straw, and you are ready to go.  pull out the straw and the hole closes and your drink doesn spill.  at the end of the day (or whenever), just put the cap into the dishwasher and it is ready to go again.<br /><br />i am elated to have found the spill spoiler.  since i am not only klutzy, but also have been known to lose things, i am going to order another one or two sets of each cap.  they work. i recommend them to anyone who drinks and spills things, and that is everyone."
i am pregnant right now and due is april 18. i bought this so that when baby is born he has a pillow already to use and not to have a flat head. i like it. its soft and comfy.
"we noticed our 2.5 year old daughter using a stuff animal as a pillow so i ordered her this a few weeks ago.<br /><br />it was more money than i wanted to spend but it is perfect and totally worth the money.<br /><br />sure, you can get a $5 pillow the same size at target but that one is lumpy and has no pillow case.  and good luck trying to find a pillow case for that size!<br /><br />this one is nice and firm which allows it to stay in place on the bed.  the pillow case is the same material as her pottery barn kids chamois sheet and she loves it.<br /><br />great buy!"
my g-daughter is teething now and i bought these to help her. i keep them in the frig and really likes them!
"this is simply a must have for parents who's baby is about to start crawling.  this product also helped my daughter to stand.  she would get lots of practice pulling herself up and standing.  very handy.  product is light, easy to carry, comes put together and folds up into a pretty small size."
"love this product!  great quality, great material, love the detail and variation of texture.  i would highly recommend this product."
"my wonderful dhu'l excellent quality and fast delivery, excellent choice<br />there're a lot of choices out there but i stumbled on samsung video monitors."
"they are just the size for my girl, it reached on time with their covers i really loved they way they look on her"
my daughter received her bag in brazil this week... we loved it !<br />i am pregnant too and i regret not to get 2 sets...<br />great quality !!<br />we are happy with purchase and the way they treat the client!<br />thank you !<br /><br />looking forward to get a new set soon ;)
"i am very pleased with this product. we bought this to aide in caring for an alzheimer's patient. we had purchased another unit, different brand, & had to return it due to poor color & picture quality. great video quality & zoom feature."
"my 6-year-old daughter really wanted to stop sucking her thumb, and asked me to order the pink thumbuster for her.  she was very excited when the product came, and she wore it without any complaint.  there was no chafing or other issue.  after going her first night ever without sucking her thumb, her confidence was raised enough that she felt she didn't need the thumbuster anymore.  she kept wearing it for a few more days at my insistence, but when she forgot to put it back on after washing her hands for dinner she went the whole night without the thumbuster... or sucking her thumb!"
"absolutely love this pouch! i love all things jujube. this pouch is huge and carries so much. i have 6-7 quicks, each with their own purpose. one is a diapering quick w/ diapers, wipes, creams, plastic bags, etc. one holds toys, books, and pacis for my son, one holds extra clothes, etc etc.<br /><br />the earth leather is just absolutely scrumptious - it really does look like leather and is soft and smooth, but it is machine washable!!! that's amazing! i can use this with my son's diaper bag or use it solo for a night out with my husband - so versatile, chic, and lovely.<br /><br />love the cool, chic steel color with the gorgeous lilac lining, along with the super sturdy jjb hardware. can't get enough of these products."
"this is a very cute backpack. although it does not offer a lot of room. though it serves the purpose i need it for very easily. i am going on a plane with two toddlers, and decided to get them one of each of these bags to put a couple of toys, and a (small sized) blanket, and it all fits in there. snug, i admit. but the bag is super cute. i will probably use them as a lunch bag when they start school."
"i love that it only cost me 161.81 and i got a stroller,car seat and a base for the car seat great deal and the product its self looks preety  safe i havent used it yet because i just got it and my baby is not here to use it yet."
this item has changed our bath time routine forever!!! the past three years have been nothing but fussing and tears for my sensitive daughter's hair washing. we used the product with smiles and laughter; she loved wearing it and did not complain at all! buy this!
"the front comes up high enough that they aren't peeing out. easy to clean and cute! this is gross, but i got my son to poop on it by telling him that frogs eat poop and the frog was hungry. whatever works, right?"
I looked everywhere for pictures like this for my daughters nursery and they are perfect! Thank you. I can't wait to hang them up on the walls.
Baby loves this turtle and so do we.....no more lost pacifier! Very soft and well made. I would highly  recommend this!
This is the only pacifier my daughter will take. We used to have the rounded version without the butterfly shaping and she didn't care for them. These seem more comfortable.
Every Princess' baby daughter needs a Princess pacifier to begin her reign!  Pretty white and pastel pink coloring with glitter and a crown emblem on the front!
This pacifier is so adorable. Brought it for my then ten month old baby. Definitely an attention getter and does it's job as a &#34;mute button.&#34; Haha.
much cheaper alternative to the medela breastpump wipes- perfect size.  Also place throughout the house for quick pacifier clean. Will order again
"We first found these three years ago when our first was a baby. They are so cute, but are really great because it is harder to lose than just a soothie. They can not roll out of the crib in the middke of the night and a child can easily find it in their crib and put it back in their mouth when they want it. My daughter is two and still has hers, but she got a hold in the soothie part and was very upset. It wpuld be nice to be able to change those out. We just sewed a new one on. It doesn't look that great but she loves it!"
"It's awesome.  Come on, it's a pacifier that makes your baby look like a vampire.  What's not to love?  It seems to be pretty sturdy and well made.  If your kiddo insists on wandering around with a pacifier, this one makes things more fun for mom!"
great product. It helps my situation. I have a daycare and infants when they are really young they do not know how to hold anything yet but the little toys with it will at least hold it in place for a while.
"This is a very cute piece that works better than traditional pacifier holders. It doesn't pinch clothing and leave marks, rather rest on the baby. Works as a pacifier holder and give baby a little friend to hold onto and cuddle with."
"This is my daughter's favorite pacifier because it is just like the one she had in the hospital, it is my favorite pacifier because she can hold it herself! Well constructed, washes easily."
I bought this for my 5 month old nephew and he absolutely love it. He grabs it and play with it.  I would definitely recommend it.
I bought this for my 5 month old nephew and he absolutely love it. He grabs it and play with it.  I would definitely recommend it.
"These pacifier animals are small enough for little hands to hold and examine, are bright and colorful and soft, and the pacifier is just right for teething, chewing and soothing.  My granddaughter absolutely LOVES these!"
"Everyone just thinks this thing is the best. He is soooo cute! Out little boy loves it as well, though at 12 weeks, he is starting to associate it with bedtime and fights like no other! The only thing I worry about is how to wash it? The paci dos not disconnect from the stuffy."
"I have tried pretty much all types of paci straps and this is by far our favorite. The clip is easy to use and stays well, even when baby pulls on it. The other end is just a loop and works on all pacis that have a ring. Only bummer is it doesn't work on the newer fancy pacis that don't have rings. We just don't take that kind out of the house, so we don't need it."
"My son had to have testing done in the hospital and these things kept him calm through the nine hours of it.  They are great.  I wish I would have known about these from the beginning.  If you are cleaning them I suggest soap and hot water.  I boiled 2 and they lost most of the smell.  The nurses told me the smell should last about a month, and it seems to.  These are wonderful for soothing."
"We got one of these when my daughter was only a few months old. She is almost 2 now and has to have the Wubbanub when she goes to sleep. It's like her best friend. Although she doesn't use the pacifier feature anymore, it's still a toy that provides her comfort. We named him George after Curious George. Great buy!"
So happy I got one of these! My little girl finally can keep it in her mouth! Plus it's cute
"My daughter has always been partial to dragons, and when I saw this for my little granddaughter, I just HAD to get it!  She chews on it, examines it, sucks on the pacifier, and bites its feet.  It's small and easily held by a less-than 6 month old who's just learning to grasp toys, and it's brightly colored and eye-catching.  Great toy for infants!"
Looks good hanging off the side of the nappy (diaper) bag and you always know where the dummy (pacifier) is.
After a month of life and being given only the breast or a pinky from her mom or dad....this is the ONLY binky our daughter will take. I love that it's all one piece and easily washable/sanitizable.
Does what I need it to do... Works great! I wish I whould have got one five children ago. So cute
I have 9 month old twins and these are the ONLY nuks that one of them will take. I only wish they came in all pink or more girly colors.
"Amazing, my son holds onto this thing better than any other pacifier, he loves it, and it has actually helped his motor skills develop!!!!"
This is by far the cutest wubbanub my son has. We have used these since he's been home from the hospital and he loves them. They seem to be very strong to his teething and biting and super easy to just throw in the wash with clothes on hot water.
"My daughter loves it, we got this one as a second one because she loved the first one so much (ella bella).  Also bought as shower gifts for all my friends"
"Really cute.  Baby loves it, great for pictures and you'll get lots of comments when your baby is &#34;plugged in&#34;!"
I bought this for my son and am exclusively breastfeeding.  I wanted a paci for the times when he just wanted to suck.  He loves this paci and it hasn't caused nipple confusion for us at all.  I'd recommend this for sure to any mom or dad:)  And also the wubbanub...:)
This is the only passy my 6 wk old will take.  I think it resembles a real nipple the most and promotes her to suck in the same way she would latch on.
Seemed to be a good product - bought as a gift for an Angel Tree in our church.  Product seemed to be exactly as promised.
"Our little girl loves her turtle. We named him Bruno and he works just as advertised, she has even started holding on to the turtle as she uses the pacifier, but when she's not holding him he stays right there and doesn't fall out. Great idea for a product and excellent follow-through to make it a great product."
"i highly recommend summer infant swaddles. they are the best. i've tried other brands and they just fall off, or don't fit right etc. i've never had any issues with these. also, my daughter preferred to have her hands out when she turned about a month old, and these still work great either way you use them."
"i recently bought this bag through amazon, at a great price!  i had been eying it for months and finally gave in, after my last 2 diaper bags had zipper malfunctions.  i was not disappointed!  the color (grey/white) and design are lovely.  the inside is lined with a lime green.  the pockets on the side of the bag are large enough for bottles/sippy cups and the pockets in front/back (though they don't zipper), have been useful to store my wallet/phone/keys.<br /><br />the bag also comes with a messenger strap and 2 stroller attachments/hooks.  my husband (although he thinks it's still girly) also thought it was really nice.<br /><br />i would recommend this bag to anyone."
this our second one.  it is easy to use.  as child gets older he will be able to identify which instruments are playing.  his favorite is the harp.the toy is easy for the baby to handle.
they work well and keep things dry. i like that the velcro goes straight across and is firm holding. the gussets are deep and can accommodate cloth and disposable diapers. i use them for a pee holding special needs child and they seem to keep the flooding contained well.
baby preferred cloth ones.  grandma likes these.  i do not like being told to use an exact number of words in my review.
"i wanted to post a helpful review, as when considering this product i was so confused. hopefully i can provide a little clarity here.<br /><br />this high chair is a new model, there was an older version also. what comes in the box is essentially everything except the seat pad and harness. amazon pairs the chair with a seat pad set that i believe was meant for the older version of this chair. there is a little white buckle on the end of the \\crotch strap\\ that will need to be removed, and having done that it all fits together fine. i could not find any other seat pad set.<br />and you do want the set. if this seat is for a baby then you will want to use the small one. i saw mentioned in another review that someone's baby couldn't reach the tray; that is because they were not using the included comfort seat, which is essentially a booster seat for the chair. this comfort seat will only work with the small seat pad. the larger seat pad is for toddlers and older children. you will receive both plus the harness if you order this item: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/b003oyxvku/ref=mw_dp_sim_ss1?pi=sy125<br /><br />as for my review of the chair itself, i love it! i am not convinced that some other reviews online are not fake negatives by competitors.<br />some have said the chair is heavy and difficult to move. really? i can slide it towards me with one foot. i imagine if you have carpet that's harder but the chair has to have some weight to it simply because of the design. it has to be sturdy.<br />others have said the straps are hard to clean and good gets stuck in the buckles. not so if you're using the harness correctly. the shoulder pads should be low so that they cover the straps and any buckles. the whole seat pad is easy to wipe off.<br /><br />i thought the price was a little high but the chair is quality. it looks like a theme park ride turned bar stool, and i am happy to pay the price if it means i don't have to have another piece of tan or hot pink plastic baby stuff in my life!<br />chances are that most people considering this chair are mainly interested in the aesthetics, and it truly is worth it. is it the best high chair in the world? probably not. is it the best looking? heck yeah!<br /><br />my only negative comments are of course the lack of clarity regarding seat pad options, and the instructions. the instruction book has a wonderful design but the instructions appear to actually go backwards, and the english is terrible. as my husband put it, it reads like \\chinese translated into german translated into swedish and then into english\\ it's really not that bad, but i did struggle with assembly.<br /><br />but it's all together now and my daughter loves it! and that's really the most important thing.stuff in my life!<br />chances are that most people considering this chair are mainly interested in the aesthetics, and it truly is worth it. is it the best high chair in the world? probably not. is it the best looking? heck yeah!<br /><br />my only negative comments are of course the lack of clarity regarding seat pad options, and the instructions. the instruction book has a wonderful design but the instructions appear to actually go backwards, and the english is terrible. as my husband put it, it reads like \\chinese translated into german translated into swedish and then into english\\ it's really not that bad, but i did struggle with assembly.<br /><br />but it's all together now and my daughter loves it! and that's really the most important thing."
"it is as described, soft, pretty and warm. very nice, thanks. . . . . . . . . . ."
"my grandson needed to use his cup at daycare instead of his bottle.  he had lots of different cups but they just didn't work well for him.  this is terrific.  he really likes it!  and no bottle any more, and this made it easy"
same exact as the pink/purple/blue/green ones found at walmart and target. never seen the yellow ones so we had to get them!
i bought this for my sister in laws shower and she lived it! it's so cute! looks just like the picture!
this is a life saver.  our baby loves it and has gotten tons of entertainment.  great for rides in the car or while at restaurants.  keeps baby entertained.  wonderful investment.
product was as described and maybe even better. received item fast and great packing. would buy again and recommend to others.
"got this for my wife after the birth of our twins and she loved it. highly recommended. it is the perfect size, and looks great on her!"
it is so easy to just throw whatever is messy into this hamper.  it looks great and i like the fact that the lid hides whats in there until its ready to be washed.  the lid also pushes down or folds out to make it easy to get stuff in the hamper.  plus its light weight and easy to carry even when its full
"the fabric they use (velboa, whatever that is) is the softest thing ever. the sack keeps your baby warm and comfy without restricting arm movement. note: this is not a good choice for babies who love to be swaddled. well made."
"mounted these on the glass door to the patio last summer and no issues so far even after cleaning the glass few times (mounted on the inside) - plus it looks great, like etched glass - stylish."
my kids love this set. i ended up having to buy 2. it is sturdy and easy for little hands to use.
"i keep this on the main level of my house (my daughters bedroom is upstairs, and so is her changing table) so this works perfect for livingroom diaper changes. it's also really easy to wipe off when needed!"
"we still have 2 1/2 months before our little guy arrives, but right now, the crib seems really great. my husband and i put this together very easily. the instructions were clear. all the parts were there. when we finished, the crib felt extremely sturdy and durable. the color is a deep espresso brown and absolutely gorgeous. couldn't be happier. feels like it's an extremely expensive crib, but the price we paid was excellent! so far, i'd take this over any over-priced crib any day of the week."
"this is a great product! i never knew how warm my baby's bath should be. the turtle makes it so easy just place it in the tub and the temp shows up right away! it is also color coated for the right temp blue for to cold, green is just right, and red for to hot! my baby loves to hold it during bath time! great product i love it!"
"i have a very active 19 month old boy who doesn't like sitting still very long. this has worked great when we go to rodeos, trade shows, outdoor events. i thought he would get mad about it, but he really respects it and doesn't pitch a fit. in fact, he goes and gets his &#34;pony&#34; when we are headed out the door."
"i got to be about 20 weeks pregnant and got this pillow - it was probably the best decision ever. especially since i was a tummy sleeping pre-pregnancy, not only did the pillow help make me sleep on my sides, but it helped make sleep comfortable for the remainder on my pregnancy. my daughter is 16 months old and i still use this pillow... lol"
really easy to use and equally easy to clean.<br /><br />note: don't suck to hard otherwise you'll have a squealing babe.
excellent price. was exactly what i wanted. very happy with my order of this product for my forest themed nursery
"my son and this look obscenely cute and I love how promptly it came. Can't wait for long road trips with my little man<br /><br />UPDATE!<br /><br />I've noticed a lot of reviews that have said that the toy doesn't wash well. I've had this binky for several months, thrown it in the wash and dryer and he's been just fine. It might be the type of detergent that's being used but I use the Tide Pods and I haven't had a single issue with Mr. Bull. :)"
"Perfect size, and just too cute! Baby is coming soon, but I'm sure he'll love it as much as I do!"
"great pacifiers and these do glow in the dark for a period of time, which made them easier to find."
"best ever tho my son now will only take his connected to stuffed animal on his wub a nub they are very worth it and should try , we use the singles as back up in diaper bags and in the bathtub"
These were an excellent pacifier choice from the many different choices out there. They lasted long and the babies loved them.
Made well but a good humor piece for the baby shower and something fun for the parents to use later on.
"These are my daughter's pacifier of choice.  We still can't live without them.  I like that they don't have a right side up, and it is nice that the are orthodontic approved.  We need to cut the habit soon, but are in the middle of moving...so until that is over...we will be purchasing more pacifiers, as she tends to lose them regularly."
"my newborn is very picky , he loves this pacifier a lot. and it is durable, looks a bit weird when baby latching on it. but it is sturdy construction is safe and make me worry free."
"Our daughter loves this binky, she only gets this binky at nap times or bed time so she looks forward to it, and the best part? Because of the little stuffed animal, she has an easier time keeping the binky in her mouth, and if it falls out she can manage to sometimes place it back into her mouth, and she's only 4 months old! We love it, the only thing not so great is the price, it should be more in the $8.99 range so it doesn't make you feel so ripped off. I'd still buy some in the future though."
I just had my 3rd baby a couple of weeks ago and have been using these pacifiers since we were still in the hospital. My baby nurses like a pro and doesn't have any issues with latching on or any indication there might be a problem with nipple confusion. These pacifiers were the ones the lactation nurses liked too. I like these better than the original soothies because the shape doesn't appear to interfere with his breathing like I always feared the round pacifiers would with my other children. These are definitely the baby's preferred pacifiers as well.
Whoever invented this is a genius!! The stuffed animal helps it stays put and not fall in the floor or get lost in the bedding etc.  And once the baby gets a little older and has more coordination the stuffed animal is a big help with enabling the child to hold on to and manipulate the binky. Great product!!!
My daughter is very picky about pacifiers these are the only ones she will take i orderd a 5 pack and they all came individually wrapped which was nice because i could just open one at a time. Very good price also
"I finally bought one of these for my second child.  With my first during sleep training, I was constantly getting up in the middle of the night to make sure the pacifier stayed, and I feel like it my first heavily relied on the pacifier to go to sleep.  Now that I have this, the weight of the giraffe allows the pacifier to stay near #2's mouth - if she moves her head and loses the pacifier, she can easily find it, or it stays with her.  Also, #2 sucks on the pacifier then turns her head and goes to sleep - I feel like the fact that the pacifier is so near she can use it when needed but then spit it out and fall asleep.<br /><br />The actual product was smaller and more lightweight than I anticipated, but I do love this product.  I only leave it at home, and take different pacifiers out of the house."
I ordered for my great grand daughter because she likes monkeys-easy to keep up with pacifier because she likes to throw it-
This is so adorable. My husband is a huge FL Gators fan and this was just perfect for our son!
"We have a newborn who absolutely loves these.  He will not use any other pacifier than these.  Anything else goes in, he spits em right out!  Our older daughter was the same way!  Quality made, durable and worth the money.  If you're looking for baby pacifiers, these are the ones you need to get!"
"My little one has not been a huge fan of pacifiers but he absolutely loved his little giraffe. #1 You can't loose it so easily #2 It's very light weight (I've heard some people actually mention they wouldn't buy it because they didn't think they were safe ... NOT TRUE) #3 If your little one is like mine and doesn't actually care for the paci so much, they have plenty of legs to chew on and make their little gums feel better. :)"
"These are by far our favorite pacis for DS. Close when dropped, what more could you ask for in a pacifier!"
I bought one for my nephew and wound up buying a few more for friends because they were so cute!
My daughter LOVES her WubbaNub's! We have purchased 6 different types so far. She will not use anything else.<br /><br />PERFECT GIFT for anyone who is expecting!!!
My daughter LOVES her WubbaNub's! We have purchased 6 different types so far. She will not use anything else.<br /><br />PERFECT GIFT for anyone who is expecting!!!
"Love, Love, Love!  She is able to get the soothie back in her mouth on her own.  Excellent product, would buy again!"
My daughter LOVES her WubbaNub's! We have purchased 6 different types so far. She will not use anything else.<br /><br />PERFECT GIFT for anyone who is expecting!!!
"You can tell its her favorite out of all the pacifiers, went ahead and ordered a few more because we keep losing it."
"My baby is 3 mos old and we introduced a pacifier around 4 weeks.  It took exactly 2 nights of trying to find spit out pacifiers on the floor before we ordered a Wubba Nub.  He loves that he can hold onto the soft stuffed animal, and I love that it's much harder for him to launch this across the room.  As he's gotten bigger, he can now navigate the pacifier into his mouth by holding on to the Dino and it helps him put himself back to sleep.  I wash it frequently since he takes it to daycare, and it has held up very well in the washing machine.  This is my new go to product for all my new mom friends!"
my baby loves it. I received this pretty quick and was very satisfied. this is small and easy to take along with us everywhere.
"Our granddaughter has long outgrown these, and I forgot to write a review, but this was a great product that we loved."
"This is the cutest little thing for my daughter. She already loves touching it, and feeling the legs, ears, and textures. She is only 2 and a half months, and this is teaching her how to hold things, and put it in her mkouch. It is very convenient! The picture makes it look like it's big, but it's actually very tiny. I would say about 4 inches. It is the perfect size."
"These are a lifesaver. The baby throws every toy off his high chair or at a table at a restaurant, which means constantly picking them up and picking up dirty toys. They also work great on strollers. I have already purchased more!"
My daughter loves this product and it is so cute. She can easily hold it and put it in her mouth without help. It is never lost.
"Got this for my granddaughter and was worried it might not be as good as the other Wubbanubs because of the extra piece of material attaching the caterpillar to the pacifier.  She still needs help sometimes getting these pacifiers in her mouth, but the flexibility of this Wubbanub with the extra material actually makes it easier for her to get and keep this pacifier in her mouth.  Usually one would think caterpillars would be more of a boy preference, but the colors of the caterpillar and the caterpillar itself deserves the name Cutsie because that's exactly what it is.  Even though Wubbanubs are expensive, they are a wonderful aid allowing babies to find and get their pacifiers into their mouths.  I have been happy with my Wubbanub purchases."
cutest binky ever<br />wubbanubs have so many to pick from and they are all cute<br />have bought several more for gifts and self
I ordered this for my great grand baby. She loves it - in fact it is about the only pacifier she will take. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a new baby.
These pacifiers are awesome. My son loves them so much and they calm him down almost immediately unless he's hungry of course.
We have bought at least 20 of these pacifiers because he will not use anything else.  They are easy to clean and attach a holder.
"I mean really, whats not to love? We bought this as part of a baby shower gift. Future parents loved it."
:)
"My daughter lives her soothies.  They seem to be the only pacifiers she will actually keep in her mouth for long enough to calm herself.  Only down side is they do not have covers, so the pacifier can get kind of dirty...meaning you can't just throw Ina diaper bag and/or stroller."
"My baby loves these! It's nice because the binkie stays in their mouth when they are little, and gives them something to grab onto as they get older."
"This is the standard symmetrical ortho nipple design. My baby preferred Nuk first, but now likes this one too. I love that, unlike Nuk, this one curves outward, so it doesn't leave a ring on my baby's fat cheeks. It also has plenty of holes for airflow so it doesn't irritate."
"With twin baby girls, we found that these are a great option when time for bed and when travelling. We also purchased wubanubs with great success, but these are larger and have an interchangeable pacifier end. This company also sent us the firmer replacements for free a few months ago. Only complaint coulkd be that there is no lock to keep the pacifier in place. We sewed ours on and it worked with no issues."
We originally bought a tabby kitten wubbanub so it would be easier to find at night than the smaller pacifiers we had been using. My baby took to it so well that it became the only one she wanted. So we chose the pink elephant for an extra pacifier. She loves them both equally and both are really cute. It's not hard to spot clean the animal part & wash the pacifier part. At 2 months baby would sometimes get ahold of the legs & pull it out of her mouth to her dismay but now at 3 months she can grab ahold of it & stick it into her mouth if she wants. She also likes just holding onto the toy part. Highly recommend this pacifier.
"They are very cute, and I like this brand for my twins niece and nephew. I got those as a present."
LOVE IT!!!!! My only complaint is that it doesn't have a paci cover...but still bought a couple of them and baby loves it!
i bought this for my grandson. He loves it and has to have it all the time.  I ordered some more too.
Very cute. My child isn't a big pacifier fan but I bought it because it's so cute.<br />A good buy.
The little man enjoys it. It is just hard to make sure the little dog does not think it is his toy. :)
"Our daughter is six months old and LOVES her Wubby.  She can get it in and out of her mouth easily in the car or at home, which is great.  If she sees it somewhere, she will focus on it until she gets it. She absolutely loves this thing. We bought two more (another elephant and a caterpillar). The elephant is my favorite because it's body is bigger and easier for her to grab. Basically, if we were stuck on a desert island and only allowed one baby item, this would be it. No question about it."
My baby loves this pacifier. If we try to give him other he spits them out. Apparently they are good?
"A great soothie, very sturdy and durable. My baby loves this and will not go anywhere without it. I love that it is a bright color so its really hard to misplace it, unlike other ones that I have had which my kid would lose or hid frequently. I definitely recommend this pacifier!!"
"My Daughter loves this, but more for the bright colors than the pacifier function. its a nice little toy for her keep in her crib"
"So cute, my nephew took to it right away. Also easy to find if dropped.  Would definitely buy one again."
"These are a great buy, great product. I love these but my baby girl decided for the thumb instead of the paci"
Godchildren love the products NUK has wonderful products. The only issue was the site should allow customers to select the color.
"We have always been familiar with the Vanilla Soothie pacifiers as they are given out by the hospital we delivered at. We used them with our first child back in 2006 and have continued the tradition with our more recent arrival. Our kids have NOT liked any other pacifiers and were extremely fickle as to which one they take, but the Soothies have never failed us.<br /><br />I have never had one of the pacifiers degrade in any way. Generally we toss them long before that point (shortly after the Vanilla scent goes away), so we can definitely attest to the durability of the pacifiers. Completely worth every penny spent!"
She loves these pacifiers. They seem to just make her feel so much better. All the fussing stops as long as we keep her Avent nearby.
"This is the only pacifier my daughter will use and the caterpillar is so cute! The shape makes it easy for her to get her hands on, which at 6 weeks is amazing. I know other people who have wubbanubs and they love them too!"
My son absolutely LOVED this pacifier. I wish I knew about it with my other two kids! It is so adorable & easier to find for me & the baby!
"Fast ship, great price on this pacifier! I was looking for something different for a baby shower and this went over great!"
"Was a present for my new great-nephew, and per his mother, he loves it!  Seems to calm and quiet him."
"I scoffed at these when I first saw them online, but was compelled to check it out after reading rave review one after another. They're the best. They are easy to find, they don't roll when they hit the ground, and much easier for my daughter to get in her mouth on her own. We have two for wash days and I couldn't live without them."
"i order this because it is BPA free , not some other products that are not BPA free,<br />shipped faster than expected."
"This is the first soother that my daughter ever used. Just the right size for newborn baby's mouth! Plus, only weeks after she was born, she was able to hold onto it herself because of the attached teddy! She grew out of it by 3 months of age though as the spout/knob part that goes into baby's mouth was too small and/or just wasn't a comfortable suck anymore."
"This pacifier was definitely one of my best finds while registering for gifts.  It's our go-to car seat pacifier.  It sits on her chest well, making it easier for her to recover after spitting it out accidentally and making it less likely to fall on the floor.  The elephant gives me something to easily grab from the drivers seat while reaching back as she cries on her way home from daycare.  Suprisingly, it also helped in her development of learning how to reach/grab and becoming more coordinated.  She's now four months old and still loves this Soothie pacifier, although she also uses MAM pacifiers in the house.  I held out for a couple months, but just gave in and purchased another WubbaNub last week.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if the pacifier could be separated from the animal for easier cleaning, but this doesn't deter me from recommending it to all of my friends."
My son is 2.5 and still has to have these everynight.  SO 5 stars it is these put him to bed peacefully everynight..... I know we are needing to get rid of them I just dread the day we dont have them. lol.
"If your child likes a binky, then this product is for you. It is a lifesaver on long car rides - prevents mom or dad from having to fumble around in the car seat for a lost binky. It stays on baby's chest, and she can even put it back in all by herself sometimes (3 months old). It's also easy to clean and very cute. Love the WubbaNub... I just wish I had thought of it first! :)"
Can't stop laughing. Such a cute idea. Great gift. My 15 month hasn't taken it out since I put it in an hour ago. So adorable. Lots of laughs on the afternoon walk today :)
Great product was exactly what I was looking for. Fast service will recommend to others. I will be leaving more from this company.
Bought this for grandson. Had one just like it for my son when a baby and it was his fav thing as it is with my grandson. Very flexible and well made.  Highly recommend.
"this camera (god bless its creators) is hte reason we were able to get a full night's rest after a year of getting up every 2 hours.  it was clear that we had to ferberize so we got this camera and when our kid would cry, we were reassured that she's ok by quickly glancing at the camera.  this product rocks!"
this is the best gate.  it looks great and does what it says it will do.  the slats are just the right width that my japanese chin don't fit through them.  once i figured out the hanging instructions it was easy.  a must buy!
"good product. as expected. no compains. if you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it."
"i was preparing to return to work, and my ebf 5 month old was having trouble with every bottle that we tried. finally, we tried sippy cups.  this one was the best because it has a soft spout.  also, it only holds 5 oz, which is about the amount my daughter eats at each sitting.  the smaller size means that the amount tips into her mouth more easily."
i havent used these yet but i was pleasantly surprised. i bought a pack of plain ones at babies r us for my first child and these are for my coming baby. these are very soft and cushy i cant wait to put them on her carseat!
"i  needed a drying rack for all the bottles, pacifiers, spoons, etc. my baby has. it works great, fits perfectly on my kitchen counter, spins with no problem. and if you have tall bottles, they fit too!<br /><br />i would buy it as a gift for a friend who's going to have a baby, with no doubt!"
"im a mom of 2 boys who weigh 37lbs and 25lbs, im just 5ft tall as well. jogging with the boys has been so easy for me comparing it to other jogging strollers. i completely love the stroller, it does look big but most side by side strollers look big. the stroller fits just fine through the front door, we have a suv so we have plenty of space when we take it with us."
"did not realize that full-sized, folding cribs were even available.  this one is very nice looking, solid and easy to fold.  it was exactly what i was looking for when my grandchildren visit.  my only slightly negative comment would be that it would have been nice to have hardware (hooks?) to hold it together when folded up.  i used a velcro strap."
"these little clothes are perfect in the baby wipe warmer. not too big, thicker than the spa silk clothes and wash up nicely."
The kid loves it in the car when we are driving. This is a great product for a baby thanks.
These are the exact same Pacifiers that come from the NIC-U (Hospital). Our little one got used to this one and only this one. therefore we needed more.
"bgh or my new born - e s 6 months old nw, still loves it!  Always easy to find and baby loves to cuddle it!"
I first saw these when my first granddaughter was born but never purchased.  I bought one for my grandson and it is great.  He loves to hold the animal and it helps to keep track of his pacifier.  There are no loose or small pieces on the animal to worry about.  Great idea.
I love these wubbanub's. this one is super cute girly and durable! My 15month old has no<br />Problum trying to find it in her crib when she is sleeping. It's awsome!
"bgh or my new born - e s 6 months old nw, still loves it!  Always easy to find and baby loves to cuddle it!"
I love these pacifiers!  They don't get lost as easily and they are easy and fun for baby to grab.
I am pleased with the product. My child does not care for it but he is just not a paci baby I guess.
Fast shipment! Love the color and size for a newborn.  Great gift idea for the new little one in your life.
i just bought a second wubbanub for my 12 month old son.  I bought the first one a year ago and the soothie is barely hanging on.  He loves walking around with the monkey.
the single most used item we have ever gotten for our son we now own 6 of them makes it easier for him to manipulate and gets tons of compliments cuz its just so cute
I had originally received this as a gift for one of my twins however after them arriving at 34weeks (6weeks) early I was conserned that it would be two big for her. However this is a little on the small side witch worked out perfectly because after being born the smallest of the two got down two 3 lbs. Also the nicu nurses love the convineance of being able to find the binky right away and that is light weight so they don't worry about it causing her any harm. Over all we love our wubbanubs!!!:) and would recomend to anyone and truely is the perfect baby shower gift!
"Love this little caterpillar.  I bought this for my niece, and she loves it.  Such a sweet little toy for her to play with while sucking her pacifier."
"Love the open space in the pacifier.  The space is less plastic to keep germs and more breathing room.  High quality, but hard to find in stores.  Love Amazon for that reason alone."
just installed my new gate. very simple to install and put together! i am very happy with this purchase. i may buy a second gate.
my sister is having her first child. so i've bee nspoiling her as much as i can. she loved it.
absolutely love these leg warmers and all of my little legs' leg warmers!  the rainbow ones go with almost any outfit and are too cute for words.  these fit my six month old and my two and a half year old great!  i hadn't really believed that they would fit such a wide age range until i tried them!  my daughter is always getting compliments on her leg warmer collection at daycare by the teachers and other parents.  don't hesitate to buy them!
"i got this for my nephew over a year ago.  he was just turning 1.  he still plays with it now.  while some people have mentioned it can tip, my view is it is so low to the ground and soft, it is a great teaching tool for balance.  kids can't live in a vacuum forever!"
"the smell is wonderful coming right at you through the plastic it comes it.<br />it is big and you can't miss it, company with be amazed at how big of dog and smell.<br />it came with the cd's i ordered and i loved that, no reason to send things in different packaging<br />unless if course very fragile."
my boys love these. it gives them a nice sense of security almost like linus' blanket. i bought multiple so that we didn't have to worry about where they were.
was as expected  came as described washes well  easy to put on and take off  washes well  hope it lasts
"it's great for kids who are slightly afraid of the dark. it's a great amount of light and it goes off after 30 min or so by then the kids are asleep, so it doesn't waste batteries."
i got this for a toddler car bed. it is strong. my toddler climbes over it to get in and out of bed.  deff would recommend it.
"this is a gift for my nephew and i will be buying another for our new edition. this is a great toy, great quality. worth every penny."
"us strollers only have the upper cover for the sun, they are not adjustable so your child will get sun at some point.  this umbrella helped us keep the sun out of our 7 month old's face when we went to europe last summer.  it's adjust, so you can point it directly to the sun.  it's also a great way to protect from wind."
"have taken it to the mainland from hawaii and back so far.  it was awesome.  kept our marathon seat in perfect condition and we stuffed it full of blankets and diapers.  no ripping problems.  it seems very sturdy and now we are using it to store our infant car seat for the next baby.  very satisfied with this purchase.  i originally bought another bag only to find out it didn't have wheels.  i returned it and got this one immediately and i'm so glad i did, even though it costs more."
this toy is super adorable....so gorgeous! looks like the characters....very pleased with the purchase!!!! xo<br /><br />i can't wait to give this to my 2 yr old niece!
None available.
my girlfriend calls this the mircale baby carrier and it totally is!!!  love it lots!  highly recommend for all babies!
super cute and soft. i am still pregnant but i am excited to use this for my lo. it get's a little chilly at night and these seems cozy enough to keep her warm.
superb product. i can recommend it to anyone who has just welcomed a new member into their family. this saved me alot of exhausting hours rocking the hammock; which is what i experienced with my first child. it is worth it. my four year old son still uses it - that tells you how much he loves it and how strong it is.
this pad is so plush and soft to the touch! my grandson rubs his little hand all over it as he's being changed! our other grandson loves the monkey design too! easy to wash/dry and return to the contoured pad -- has fit perfectly since we removed it from the packaging and cleaning cycles haven't affected the fit at all!
"the color its great for boy or girl,  its not too heavy,  it has a support for babies neck.  i really like it"
"i already have some of these nuk bottles and i love them! my baby girl is 8 months and it was very easy to introduce these kind of bottles to her (she accepted them happily from the very first time) but in my country i couldn't find the replacement silicone thing (only the normal ones) and not hello kitty one (just pink ones). so my child is already interested on drawings and colors, and her room is all decorated with hello kitty theme (obviously mommy is a big fan :) ), not only nuk make great products , it looks fancy and the product itself is awesome, never spills and you can put some thick liquids in there (like juice and other stuff) and it doesn't get stuck! it is great and totally reocmmended! :)"
i highly recommend these potty seat covers. they completely cover the toilet seat and have an extra long front to keep kids legs from touching the bowl. they also stay in place on the seat. i have tried other seat covers and they fall off before i can even get my daughter on the seat. this product is an absolute must have for potty training and after!!!
"i really love those caps,it came out so much handy and easy to clean .highly recommend.two thumbs up for all avent products!!!"
"if you are hand washing breast pump parts, the lawn drying rack is a lifesaver!! a relative has the smaller \\grass\\ drying rack and is constantly running out of apace on the rack. we purchased the larger \\lawn\\ along with a \\tree\\ for hanging smaller parts and couldn't be more pleased! the grass holds everything easily from the smallest parts to the largest. the grass is stiff as another reviewer mentioned, but in my opinion it keeps the parts suspended for better air circulation and drying."
"we got one for one grandson and liked it so well, we ordered one for another grandson!  good size, colorful and good quality!  arrived very quickly."
We got this for our son when he was a few months old.  It has been with him every nap and bedtime.  He absolutely loves it.  And just as we were ready to break him of it (after two years) our son pulled and pulled on the paci and it separated from the Bevo and it was a great way to say Oh no...its broken  I am glad it wore out when it did.  Made the transition much easier!!
My boys love these. It gives them a nice sense of security almost like Linus' blanket. I bought multiple so that we didn't have to worry about where they were.
"These are great, they were the only pacifiers my newborn would take.  They hold up good and are easy to disinfect."
"Life-saver!  Those nuk pacifiers drop and roll away, usually under something heavy. Problem solved with the wubanub. Easy to grip for little hands, and to clean.  There are many styles available so shop for one on sale - don't pay full price!"
I had purchased these at Target for my now 6yr old son when he was an infant. I loved them very much. when i got pregnant again I couldn't find them in any store and was very disappointed. However i found them on amazon and ordered them without any question. Received the same great product as before just a different look. me son was born early and is a little small so st first he chocked on them so we had to use a smaller different brand however at 4 months he has started taking them and seems to like them. I like these the best because they don't leave that awful ring around there mouth and the saliva doesn't lay there and cause an awful rash.
"Would have liked to have this for my first two kids!  Got it for my third, just as he quit using a pacifier, of course!  None of our kids used the pacifier much over two months, but for those two months, it's nice to have any extra help you can get!  He doesn't use a pacifier now at 8 months, but I keep this in the diaper bag for him anyway.  He's teething and likes to have stuff to chew on!"
This product is exactly as described.  We really like the Kidz Med Non-Contact Thermometer and would certainly recommend it.  It takes a bit of getting use to it but works so much better than contact thermometers.
"For all three of our kids, soothie was the only paci they would accept. So, when we found this lovie and paci set we knew we'd like it! Our two month old enjoys the paci and will wrap her tiny hands around the little lamb lovie. I imagine this will quickly be the favorite for her!"
"By the time I had my second child I was soberly aware of the dangers of BPA and many other plastics, so I sought out a natural rubber pacifier.  After a couple of duds, we found this.  It's great! My daughter is 18 months and still uses the small rounded size.<br /><br />First and foremost, it had to be safe.  And this is, in many different ways.  Made from natural rubber and oils, I am not concerned about contaminating plastics.  The shape is awesome; it cleans up easily and has no cracks for bacteria to hide when cleaning and sterilizing.  When it first comes out of the box, it is oily.  As others have mentioned, after you wash for the first time, instructions say to boil for a few minutes.  Let it cool and you'll see the oils have been tamed.<br /><br />My daughter loves this paci.  We once ran out of them after I noticed a crack on the side of the nipple (my fault - I let it go much longer than the recommended 6 weeks between replacement).  That was a very long a night.  I tried a few chemical laden replacements until I could get a new shipment in to no avail.<br /><br />All that being said, these are expensive.  And the cost doubles when you realize that you are supposed to replace them every 6 weeks or so.  Much longer than that and the pacifiers start to harden.  But for all the benefits, I will continue to use these and have some peace of mind knowing I am using the safest product."
"I bought these pacifiers for my daughter before she was born. I wasn't really sure what kind to get as I was a first time mom. I loved the fact that they are one complete piece, rather than the plastic piece and the rubber part. I feel like those can get gunk caught in them easier. This pacifier is still the ONLY one we use. They are kind of goofy looking while in her mouth, but she loves them, and I love that I don't have to worry about stuff getting caught in the creases of it. We will continue to use this pacifier as long as she uses one."
"Very good product, quality and finish.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .."
My sister has triplets and they love this brand of pacifiers. It was nice to find a package of pink and purple gumdrops that was large enough to accommodate all three girls.
I also like these as they are easy to find in the crib in the middle of the night because they glow in the dark.<br /><br />These hold up well to daily use and being put into the microwave sanitizer.<br /><br />These have become baby girls favorite. Pricing was fair.
"Love these binkies! While my daughter prefers the orthodontic ones, I couldn't review the rounded for any lower because these pacifiers are truly remarkable. My daughter has a tied tongue, not enough to get it snipped but we tried every binky out there and at 3mos old, took the jump to try a 6mo & up size. What a world of difference! If your LO has latching issues with binkies, try a size up. Best advice I can give! She's 5mos now and still loves these."
"Awesome gift for the Cardinal fan parent(s). Bought this for a male co-worker whose wife is expecting this summer. Unfortunately they are recommended for 3 months and up, so hopefully the baby could sport the pacifier during another WORLD SERIES? Here's to hoping!"
"I bought this for our baby grandson. It is really soft and plush feeling. The sound it makes sounds exactly like an ultrasound of mom's tummy. It has a velcro strap that you can put on the crib, to lull the baby to sleep. Once the baby is older, you can remove the part that makes the noise and use it as bear to sleep with. It looked safe enough to me to let a small child play with. I checked the eyes on the bear and they felt very secure. I thought it was a great value because I wanted my grandson to have a teddy bear and also something that would help him go to sleep.I am a bear collector, so I am picky about the bears I like to buy. This looked more like the old fashioned looking teddy bears because I don't like the bears that have noses the size of a pig's snout. It comes really secured in its packaging and was in perfect shape on arrival. I thought it was an excellent choice for the price."
These are so cute! We were so excited to find cute pacifiers in my daughters favorite brand. My girls each had a variety of Hello Kitty in their stockings for Christmas this year.
good for me are perfect<br />this is beautiful and i like it a lot<br />thanks for the puntuality on the shipment
"I wanted to surprise my daughter and son in-in-law with these pacifiers for my newborn grandson, because they are major White Sox Fans.  They thought they were so cute, that they're saving them for his memory box.  Great price for a great gift."
My daughter loves her wubbanub. I thought it was very cute. She is 2 months old and can easily hold it and put it back in her mouth if it falls out. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
"this is the cutest thing I have ever seen, not only does it work but my 9 week old just loves it and can hold it on his chest at night and doe not loose it, when it does finally fall out it stays right next to him so he does not awake because he feels it fall.  just love love love it........"
My lil breastfeed one didn't at allo like this pacy just like the other 3 different brands I purchased... I had high hopes but epic fail.  the paci is sturdy and made nice just not for my infant....
"When my daughter was very little she loved this kind of pacifier, but it would always fall out of her mouth and she would get mad. I got this to help 'hold it in'. Of course shortly after she decided she no longer wanted a pacifier and turned into a &#34;thumb sucker at bedtime only&#34; kind of girl. However, she still LOVES to play with this. She chews on the pacifier as a teether, and likes to toss around the caterpillar. So even though we don't use it for it's intended purpose, I still highly recommend it. It's adorable!"
"My baby tried so many pacifiers, and this one is his favorite!! And it's so easy to wash it! I was so exited that I've found it on Amazon, cause every store I check, they only have 0-3 mths. Only Amazon has 3+"
This game was super fun to play at my baby shower. It got alot of people to laugh and participate in the game. :)
"These are great, just like her others but have the Hello Kitty on the front.  Cute and fun.  Gets washed all the time and the image hasn't worn off."
"We got one of these when our daughter was born a few weeks ago and looked around to find some more. They're very hard to find in stores and mainstream brand has even copied the design and name (not sure if it was licensed?). The reviews on that product aren't ideal, but this pacifier is much softer and is one that my daughter will take much more than any others we've tried."
What I like most about these is that they come with the covers that pop on and off easily so that the nipple itself stays protected.  They are nice and not at all flimsy like some of the other ones I have seen.  They do not irritate her mouth either.
"Our three-month-old absolutely loves his Wubby - it is great that it doesn't fall far when he spits out his paci, AND it's turning into a fun toy now that he's learning how to grasp.  He is so proud of himself when he is able to get it in his mouth by himself, and he loves holding onto the puppy's ears while he's falling asleep.<br /><br />We love that eventually we can cut the paci off and our little one will still have his comfort object; we've bought several of these to keep around just for that!"
"We purchased quite a few pacifiers and this is the only one our newborn son loves.  We got a dozen and they are great to soothe him.  We love that it doesn't wrap around his mouth and it easily falls out of his mouth when he falls asleep.  As much as we wanted our son to have great sleep habits without using a pacifier, sometimes after many sleepless night and days,  you do whatever gets the job done and keeps your sanity."
"Pros: Natural, stays in well, easy to keep clean, no nipple confusion<br />Cons: expensive, bounce a long way when dropped"
"I have tried many pacifiers, and so far, my son loves these the most!  Can't complain about them at all!"
I bought this &#34;stachifier&#34; as a surprise for a friend's little boy ...best and most adorable present ever!!! Definitely would buy this again!
It was adorable and I am sure the new baby will look cute with it.  Conversation piece for sure!  Thanks
I love the yellow! I was concerned they might be heavier like the blue ones but they are they are just like the green but yellow!  Im going to be ordering more of these!
2 yr old loves his Dino.  He will ugly take a wub a nub but they are so cute I am okay with it.  Colors are pretty true to picture
My daughter will only use the Avent soothie pacifiers and I hate them because they bounce around when they fall and we are constantly losing them. This product is perfect to stop them from falling and are great in the car seat!
This is now the 2nd wubbanub i've purchased for my baby nience and she just can't get enough of them. Highly recommend it!
My daughter will only use the Avent soothie pacifiers and I hate them because they bounce when they hit the floor and we are constantly lose them! This product is great because it prevents them from falling to the floor!
"I love these wipes for a couple of reasons.<br />A. It's a small enough package to put anywhere in the baby bag or purse.<br />B. It's natural ingredients so that I can use these on my child's mouth and paci and immediately give it back to him with out fear of harming him of any chemical toxins.<br />C. They get the sticky gunk off their mouth: milk, or formula<br />D. Cleans off lanolin from skin (This was great for me since I do breast feed and need the lanolin to keep my skin supple and not cracked but did not want it all over my child face.  It cleans up nice with out drying out the skin!  I have also found them useful when cleaning up lanolin from a breast pump)<br /><br />By a person who swears by you can never have enough wipes and diapers.. these are a must have for any first time mom, mom to be, or current mom on the hunt!!"
I highly recommend this product to everyone out there who is struggling with their breastfed 2 month old baby to latch on a pacifier! I have got a collection of over 10 kind of pacifiers and  nothing worked but this... Of course with a bit of a struggle...<br />If your little one pushes the pacifier and does sucking reflex in her/his sleep I would say with more practice your baby would beautifully latch on this paci but with more practice not from one go!
I really like this little thing. I attached it to the handle of my diaper backpack and it's easy to find a pacifier when my baby is screaming in my face! Only holds 2 pacifiers though. No idea what could possibly be stored in the tiny outside pocket. Maybe an ibuprofen for the headache you get from the screaming baby in the first place?
"great packaging, legit and baby safe, loved these the baby is just 6 months old he likes them too !"
kids love it and came so fast.<br /> but wish you can take the pacific out and put in more so i can wash it better
This product is great. It's really nice that they glow in the dark. It makes it really easy to find they and put them back in your baby's mouth in the middle of the night.
Love this product for my daughter!! She loves to hold the animal while she sleeps and it makes it much easier for her to use herself!
"really love this carrier. it is easy to use, it feels safe, and my baby girl love it! i had a chicco and was really disappointed with it, so i looked for an alternative and now i am really happy with the nordic baby carrier. i strongly reccomend it."
my little boy is 5 and this scooter is nice and sturdy and has a big surface for your feet.
looks great in the package and hoping my daughter will love it! my son loved these nipples so we are hoping our daughter is the same.
"my baby love this product front and back, he watches each and everyone, it facinates him and it keeps him occupied."
"this is an amazing mat, it has soo much of activites for baby. the batteries have to change, my music did not work as yet. would def. recommend this."
the rug was for my grandson and fit just perfectly beside his crib. he is just learning to crawl and loves the bright colors. the rug arrived on time and without defects.
"love this hands free bra! i started out using a medela hands free bra, but after a couple washes, the medela bra lost its elasticity and wasn't supportive enough.  this bra is great!"
"great set, its beautiful, i love pooh bear and its a great for male or female. i would def. recommend this item."
"this cover is really soft, the colors are beautiful and it is a perfect complement for the adorable dino bedding set."
this is a good baby cup.my friend introduced me to buy this cup. when my son used it very well.
"this is a very quiet hand pump, easy to use and put together. very good value for the price.  perfect for travel use."
love this pregnancy pillow!  it's the perfect length for me (i'm 5'6&#34; and overweight).  noticed a lessening of back pain shortly after i started using this.
we purchased this rail guard to protect the convertible crib once our son began getting teeth. the top of the rail is rather thick and this guard covers it perfectly. there are 5 ties that secure it to the rail snugly. now there are no worries about baby ingesting the stain or about him ruining his future big boy bed!
"easy to use, i can put this on by myself and put baby in the carrier at home or the park for walks.  i used this from when my daughter was 1 week old.  she is now almost 3 months and it is my go to baby carrier.  she loves it and falls asleep in it."
i choose this rating because it got here when it said it would.<br />My grandson really loves it alot.<br />and yes i would recommend this product to any one.
"Hard to say who enjoys it more, grandma or the grand baby...I guess the grand baby.Good quality item with a great design."
"Not only are these incredibly cute, but it is fantastic for those times when binky pops out of the mouth in the middle of the night and baby wakes up and needs to find it. I spent months getting up in the middle of the night, multiple times, to retrieve a binky that either rolled out of the crib or baby couldn't find it. This one is easy to find in the crib and it won't fall out of the crib!! This is essential to parents' sanity and sleep!! We get tons of comments on this because it's so cute and unusual. I've even washed this in the washing machine (air dry) and it didn't fall apart. After probably a year of solid use, the binky part did eventually come off of the elephant, but I re-attached it with a safety pin and it's still being used. The biggest downfall of this binky is that other kids really want to steal it! :-) I would absolutely recommend this product for you and for every baby shower you ever attend! I can't say enough good words about this product."
"We weren't going to give our daughter a pacifier but our pediatrician recommended it. My sister got us a WubbaNub and it was a lifesaver! When our daughter was very young, it was perfect because it rested on her chest and never fell out. Now she can hold on to it and grab it easily to put it back it which is especially handy in the middle of the night or in the car! My recommendation is to use this early on but try to get your child to use a different pacifier during the day before they get too used to it. Our daughter only uses a pacifier for naps and at night but if she needs one during the day we're trying to get her to use a standard pacifier. They are cute but as she approaches 1, I'm thinking a giraffe hanging off her face is a little much. Great product though and I buy them for everyone having a baby."
I love this product and so does my daughter. serves as a toy and a pacifier! very easy and convienient!
We have 2 and they are both awesome and easy to find around the house. My daughter loves grabbing the stuffed animal and putting the pacifier in her mouth on her own.
"My daughter loved these pacifiers!  They were the only ones that she would take, and they are super cute too!"
"These are the real deal GumDrops from Hawaii Medical. These are the only pacifiers that our two sons would take. Beware of other products called GumDrops, but not made by Hawaii Medical -- these here are slightly firmer and hold up well over time. We like the GumDrops over the green Soothies (from the same company) given the nose cut-out at the top of the paci."
We love our wubbanub!  Makes it so much easier to keep up with our daughter's pacifier.  In the car when she drops it... it's easy to find and we don't have to dig around in her carseat to figure out where it rolled off to!  She likes to hug and hang on to it as well.  Two thumbs up!
I wish they would have been pink but they are so cute and we just love them. It made a nice stocking stuffer for Christmas.
My grandson loves this little wubbanub and he has 4 and when it is time to break the passy we will remove it and let him keep the stuffed animal.  Makes for an easy break from the passy
This pacifier is for a child over 6 months.  It is my grandson's favorite and I had to order multiples.
These are great. My kids were loosing there pacifiers at night while they were sleeping and screaming their heads off. These are much easier for them to find in the dark.
Shipped quickly and arrived on time. The only &#34;binkies&#34; my son has been willing to use since he was born!
"My daughter and her husband really got a kick out of this, and anyone who sees it has a good chuckle. It even works ... most of the time."
"I Love The Wubbanub Pacifiers! My Daughter has 4, Her last one was getting kind of worn, ordered from Babyhaven, No problems at all. And deliverey was on time! I will be ordering from Babyhaven in the future. Great Prices"
"Each baby has his/her own favorite tastes and preferences,my daughter's totally different from my son's; however, this product was the only one my son would even consider.  I wish I had found it when my daughter was a baby, because as a parent I really like the fact that it is all one piece and made from natural rubber."
"I mean, this is a must for him (and for me). This is the piece that makes my son sleeps! I am telling you, my house is full of these pacifiers they are all over the place. You can never go wrong with this. The one comment I would make is to makre sure you pick the correct one based on the baby's age. My son is 10 months now and he still does not like the 6+ months one (they are thicker). This product with time and after you sterilize them so many times it will get a little bit thiner but it works like a charm!"
"My daughter is 6 weeks old and these pacifiers are the only ones that she seems to like. Sure, they can fall out a little easy but if it soothes her and gets her to stop crying, there is no way I am taking them away."
Great product! We never lose this pacifier! It also helps keep the pacifier in my daughters mouth safely!! Would buy again!
Easy to keep up with!  We always have a toy to play with and a soothie when she's sleepy!  Love all wubbanubs!
I purchased these for my daughter when she was 4 weeks old and at nearly 4 months we're still using them! They're so fun and much easier to keep ahold of then a single pacifier. Plus having something to snuggle with or teeth on is a bonus! They're light weight and brightly colored so she's still fascinated by them.
it took my daughter just a couple of tries to warm up to her new pacifier.  i'm so happy she loves it!
So so so cute!!!!!!! I love these little things. I just hope that my baby will actually get to use them and that they are safe. So far so good because no one can use them yet. But they are SO so cute.
"Our dtr used her WubbaNub for over a year. It was perfect from newborn, where it helped keep the binkie in place, to when she was older so she could find the binkie and put it back in her mouth. I recommend this to everyone with newborns!"
Happy I found these pacifiers. I had been looking around for awhile. Happy the baby will be matching with his brown outfits!
SO SO SO SO SO<br /> CUTE LOVE IT I GAVE IT TO MY COUSIN IN LAW AND SHE LOVED IT
Great natural alternative to the silicone pacifier; comfortable fit that baby seems to prefer in comparison to other brands. Recommend
"My 2 month old daughter loves it, and only a dragon would be epic enough for my child. Rock on."
i love this monitor. the picture and night vision is awesome. the sound is great too. i used velchro and attatched it to my daughters crib. i can walk around and clean the house and still be able to see her while she is napping. i love it!
"i couldn't be happier with this set!  i'm expecting my first little girl, but i'm not a pink girl myself, so when i found this set i was in love!!  for the price (some sets i liked were well over $200!) this set was worth the $$$.  and personally, i did not want a bumper, so i was happy to see this set was available with either option."
this cover is cute and very soft. we like the print and it looks and works well for us. good purchase!
this holds more than it looks! i had a skip hop of similar shape but because of the design it held much too little for the needs of a newborn! this is beautiful and well designed!
"from the moment we gave it to him our son has happily chewed on this rubber toothbrush. he's very interested in watching and imitating us when we brush our teeth, and this teether does the job of starting him on that habit. highly recommended."
my daughter really likes these now that she is 5 months old. (at 4 months she didn't as much.) she finds the ends easily and appears to enjoy them.
"one word: amazing!  i swaddled my daughter from day 1 and she has always slept wonderfully.  anytime i wouldn't swaddle her, she would sleep for half the time.  this particular swaddle is nice because the velcro on the flap would stick wherever you stretched it to.  my daughter was on the smaller side, so that made it much easier to get a good snug fit!"
outstanding! the stroller is super smooth and life's with no effort. the only thing missing is a safety lanyard to keep it from getting away....a 10 dollar fix i took care of myself.
"~background~<br />i purchased this bib for my 3 month old son.<br /><br />~pros~<br />- great quality.<br />- unique and fun design that's definitely a conversation piece.<br /><br />~cons~<br />- not absorbent.  it's more repellent due to the material and finish.<br /><br />~notes~<br />- definitely for smaller/younger babies.  as a previous reviewer stated, the interior circumference of the bib closed is approximately 11 inches.<br /><br />~conclusion~<br />this is more of a novelty item than functional bib.<br /><br />we used this in conjunction with the [[asin:b007m2og86 mustache pacifier]] for even more fun!"
we bought this to keep our puppy off of the carpet. it was easy to install and it works great!
"without a doubt, if you're going on a plane, get this. so much easier to stuff the stroller in, throw it over your shoulder, and go... while maintaining the warranty while underneath the plane. i can only imagine the kind of torture it's put through..."
"looks excellent, very good eye catcher, and durable. my little one is now 20 months and loves to look at the ocean animals on the sheets."
"i am not breastfeeding, but this is certainly a useful product because i place my baby in it to feed him as well as keep him upright for a while after feedings to reduce spitting up.  the adorable sheep on it adds to the cute factor."
great lunch bag.  beautiful colour and well made.  fun to take for lunch - definitely something different!  my daughter loved it!
wow thanks to everyone who recommended this as a transition off the bottle. it has worked perfectly for us after trying so hard to get our son off bottles
my son has slept with a white noise machine since birth.  my husband and i got this specifically for a plane ride and trip out of town.  my little guy liked it so much that he continues to tote it around the house with him.
very soft and fits my changing pad perfectly.  this changing pad also washes well without shrinkage or pilling of fabric.
"i debated if my 4.5 year old would fit, he does just fine.  he love riding with his baby sister.  i also take my baby on her own when my son wants to walk and it handles fine.  i am tall, 5'11&#34; and have no troubles running with it.  love the handling."
"this is great.  it holds all of my son's toys and makes it so easy to clean up at the end of bath time, just scoop everything in and you're done.  the top is nice and wide and makes it easy to get toys in and out."
i bought this for my son and daughter-in-law and my new grandson.  the picture is amazing--especially at night.  the night vision image is as clear a s a bell.  would recommend to anyone for baby shower gift
"love the fact that the silverware are pba free, and they came with a carrying case! would definitely buy again."
"this is the cleanest, simplest and most efficient training potty out there.  it doesn't have silly bells and whistles, but rather gets the job done well and fits my son comfortably.  it's super easy to empty/clean and doesn't distract from my clean decor at home."
i bought 4 of these and gave them as gifts to my grandchildren's grandparents - myself included.  much better quality than i have found in similar products.  a creative and treasured keepsake.
this mattress pad cover came quickly and was exactly what i needed to store my son's crib mattress until the next baby.
it fit the mattress great and did not slide off  it was also very soft and washed and dried well
"good product, very good condition and presentation. it works in perfect condition. good choice. great for personal use or for gifts."
"love, love ,love. prefer over thirsties for sure. this cover is a little thicker due to the soft lining on the inside but i love that feature. velcro is awesome quality"
"my daughter loved her sophie. she used it a long time, i now get this for baby shower gifts for friends."
these covers are great. they take up no space at all in your pocket and completely cover the potty on the sides and front.
it matches exactly to the color on her bugaboo cameleon..and it keeps her warm and it cleans easily if anything is spilt on it.
great sheets for the price!  they fit the dream on me 3&#34; portable crib mattress perfectly.  i'll be purchasing a few more as the quality is very good.
this is a good bottle brush. we've had many and i think this one is just as good as any we've had.
"bought these for my son a year ago. the design is perfect for toddlers learning to feed themselves. the deep spoon allows them to scoop and no spill as easily-which make meal time easier and fun. liked them so much, we bought sets to keep at grandma and grandpa's too!"
"super lame pun, i know.<br /><br />okay, so i started out using rockin' green hard rock when i first started cloth diapering, due to the extremely hard water in our area.  a very kind person bought it for me off of my registry.  when i ran out, i started using all free & clear, because i had read that people with my type of water were having success with it, and we didn't have a whole lot of money to spend on nice detergents.  i'm not sure if the all free & clear just wasn't cutting it, or if perhaps i wasn't using enough, but i certainly know that i didn't have detergent buildup, but my diapers all of a sudden got super funky, which they had never been before.  i have a feeling the funk came in with some used diapers that i got, but i just couldn't get rid of it!  so i broke down and bought some rockin' green again.  and what do you know?  i am getting rid of the odor problem!  it wasn't completely fool proof, because i've had to adjust the amount and the rinses several times to figure it out, but we are getting there.  yay for not being punched in the face by stench when taking out the diaper pail!!!  thank you, rockin' green!<br /><br />also...  i have a very sensitive baby, and the scent doesn't seem to bother him.  however, i can't even smell it at all by the time i take my diapers out of the dryer, :( so why even bother getting a scented detergent?  just a thought."
my granddaughter was so thrilled when she got this for christmas.  she is not a toddler but 13 and has always loved piglet.  this was one of her wish list items on amazon.
"you're going to love these blankets! the softest swaddle blankets out there. love the simple and muted patterns. consider getting two packages. we ended up keeping one in the car, one in the baby bag, one in the stroller... just love them!"
"the best 30 bucks i've spent! my little bub was screaming her head off right before i put her into the carrier and once she sits right in, boom! smiles all round!! and she'll still keeping still and happy as i write this review!! can't think of any downsides yet! good job infantino!"
was excited to get.  it and was not  disappointed.  very cute and lots of good information to write in!<br />i would buy it as a gift too.
"Product was BPA free and good for use with infants, so I was even more delighted that the pacifiers read &#34;Mute Button&#34; and &#34;Pull to Sound Alarm&#34; -- the bonus is, she loves them!"
this binky is very cute for all occasions my 7 month old son just looks so funny but its adorbz! recommended for your lil monters
Easy tool to use; my granddaughter cooperated very well with the non contact method. Recommend highly to other families now
This a great pacifier. It doesn't leave a red ring on babies face like sine others do. It's great for babies who like to chew on there binkys. My little guy loves this one. My sister in law uses them too.
"buy this. seriously. well, first have a baby. but then you should buy this. we have our first little girl and she just moved into her own room. it is so convenient to check on her without opening the door and potentially waking her. also: we have now traveled twice with it and we use it at family and friends' houses. seriously. buy this."
everyone that received  these gifts at my sisters shower loved them.  i thought the price was average and they gave the elegant touch i wanted for my sister's special day.  she felt like a princess.
the best thing for kids ever. if you have a kid learning to go porgy you need this for it.
the is a great pack and play for the price.  it's just what i wanted.  i recommend this pack and play.
"what a simple but genius idea to prevent that nasty sour-milk smell when milk or formula gets trapped in the folds of a baby's neck. the fabric is soft and absorbent, the velcro is very grippy, overall good quality (which is important since these bibs are a bit pricy compared to the average bib). despite the fact it specifically says it's for newborns, i'm still able to use it on my nearly 6-month old who is a tank and has a nice double chin going on. :) great product."
"fits with most of my carriers. it's easy to put on and wraps around baby's legs, keeping the heat inside. good fabric, easy to wash and doesn't wrinkle in the diaper bag. the hood comes of for face front position!"
"yes, i could swaddle my infant with a regular baby blanket. however, when i was a sleep deprived parent of my newborn son i found this to be one of the greatest conveniences! it was quick and easy to get him swaddled and soothed. he looked so cozy it it. when he woke up in the middle of the night for feedings and needed a diaper change, we could do it without unswaddling his arms so it was easier to soothe him back to sleep. my wife also likes the cute designs so we are definitely getting more of these for our daughter who we are expecting soon!"
love my maya wrap! so easy and versatile. people stop to ask me about it and i always give rave reviews!
only had the seat a few days but so far so good. little girl loves her big girl seat- even fell asleep in it the first ride. her head did not fall forward and she seemed comfortable . really like the easy install and how the harness fits her. its also great that the harness is so easy to adjust- do not have to take it out of car so makes it easy to adjust around big heavy coats. have not had to wash cover yet but does not look like it will be too bad getting back on since it snaps. its not quite as soft as i thought it would be but she doesn't seem bothered.
"my grandson loved him, to manipulate sound due to the material they are made, so it was a success! is an excellent present that i recommend!"
thanks... it's perfect.... nice... i reccomend! i hope i can find more items like this one. thank you again we loved!
lived up to fisher price reputation.  very colorful and attracts baby's attention.  mat is great for rug surface.  would not recommend on hard surface.
"i like this. my son loves the projections although i wish there were a few more per page. that would be my only knock on the product. two projections per page seem to be enough, though, to help my son fall asleep so i still gave it 5 stars. cute pictures and i like that the music lasts an extended period of time. great product!"
"Our son is a little mover and we purchased this changing pad because of the slopped sides and the safety belt. Although the belt and sides cannot stop a super determined crawler, this was very helpful in minimalizing his movement and helping to make changing time more manageable. great buy!"
These pacifiers are so easy to find when thrown or missing. My son loves the WubbaNub line and continues to use them every day.
So did we. Cutest thing ever. We kept it in the car and baby loved to play with it on car trips. Well made.
"my daughter is much more comfy now, very happy w the purchase. i feel better knowing she feels better. happy!"
my granddaughter loves this. it has become her favorite thing when going to bed. it is a great night light and shuts off after a while so when she goes to sleep it doesn't waste batteries. the illumination on the ceiling and walls is a nice effect with moon and stars. as it offers several colors of light it keeps it interesting for a 4 year old.
"bought this for my first grandson, i had bought his furniture at pottery barn kids (expensive) but got the mattress here.  he is 3 months old and the mattress is wonderful.  reasonable priced and well made."
"this has been the only babyproofing cover that my son has not been able to figure out at the ripe ol' age of 2 1/2. my covers get a lot of wear and tear on them, so i had to purchase an additional set when one broke. i also love that i am able to throw them in the dishwasher if they happen to get dirty."
these car seat's are awesome and well worth the money!!  they are a breeze to install and easy for the child to nap in comfortably without their head falling forward like in most car seats.  i bought this for our second car because we love the one we have in our first car so much.
ordered this to make christmas gifts for grandparents and they were a hit!!  this kit is super easy to use and they best part is there is little to no mess.  many of this kits i looked at you had to mix the clay up but with this one all you have to do is take it from the package and mold it in your hands for  a few minutes.  my only recommendation is the instructions say the final molds only need to sit for 3 days however it you want to write something on the back of your ornament i would recommend letting them sit for a week.
my wife always tossed and turns. while pregnant she wouldn't travel with out this pillow. worth every penny. helped keep her on her side and helped her get some better sleep.
"i first heard about these from my mother-in-law.  i bought my own set because i liked them so much.  these bumpers go right under the sheet and keep your child from rolling off the bed.  for anyone who travels with their child, is transitioning their child to a big kid bed, or sends their child to grandparents for sleepovers these bumpers are a light-weight, easy to travel with must!"
ove it...was easy to install and looks gorgeous on the landing of my stairway.........would recommend this company and will probably order again for another room in my house
"i have every teething toy... i have bought dozens. literally.  and finally my baby boy enjoys this one, right out of the package!  hooray!"
this was a christmas gift to my granddaughter & my daughter-in-law said she just loves it :) she even sent me a picture showing me how much fun she was having with them :)
we used and loved aden + anais blankets with our first daughter & ordered this blanket when we found out we were having a second little girl. very soft and warm. beautiful pattern.
"it was very useful on our trip. it inflates and deflates quickly. it does smell like plastic but that is to be expected, it was not overwhelming by any means. crib sheets fit well. our daughter is 2 1/2 years old and about 40 inches tall and this fits her perfectly. easy to carry, inflate, deflate and fold up which we had to do at least 5 times on our trip."
wish it was still available but couldn't find one recently when i looked to buy another for the newest addition to our. family.
"i have been using this tubing for about a month now. it works perfectly and connects perfectly to my pump, the medela pump in style advanced. it is still perfectly clean...no milk in it or anything. just make sure to keep it running for a little bit after pumping to make sure all condensation is out of it. love it and can't beat the price!"
"we are very happy with this bag. lots of compartments and space, and great quality. the bag is also very stylish and not too girly. overall very pleased with all aspects of this diaper bag. we would definitely purchase another jj cole bag."
this doll is great. it has been teaching our 1yr. old the parts of the body. if doll isn't being touched for about a minute it says \\i'm bored\\.<br />this is unnecessary.
"for anyone with children, or if you just want to organize, this item is soo perfect. my 3 and 4 year old can not get into it no matter what they try. perfect safetly precaution. i am going to buy another one for under my bathroom sink."
very nice look and fits perfect the quinny modd stroller. easy to use and not so heavy as thought. totally recommended.
perfect tool for the transition from baby food to table food.  should be used earlier rather than later...once a child has teeth it becomes less necessary.
i bought this for storage in our playroom.  i also have my girls' big doll house on top if it for easier playing access.  it was fairly simple to put together and is very sturdy.  great product!
i use these decals to help keep the birds from crashing into my windows. they have been very helpful. the number of fatalities is significantly reduced.
i like it! it served it's purpose. our baby was too small for the actual seat. the snugseat helps him stay up so that he is able to see everything when we go out for walks. he just turned four months.
"i wish i'd gotten this when we first started doing bottles.  it does best if you do 28 ounces or less, but even if you have to make two batches, it's so much easier than making the bottles seperately.  it also does a much better job of mixing the formula, it seems to give it a completely different texture (in a good way).  i've read some reviews that it's flimsy.  thruthfully, i've washed it as directed in the top of the dishwasher and had no issues.  even if it did, i'd just shell out another 10..it's a small price for the ease it provides."
works very well. highly recommend constantly making certain the conct remains if you haven't used it for awhile for safety's sake. same product was much more expensive at a local store.
bpa free. lid closes securely. excellent quality. definetely a must buy. don't settle for the wrong things when it comes to your baby :)
"this is my favorite bag of all times.<br />the quality of this diaper bag is amazing!<br />i love everything about it.<br />the numerous pockets, the sleek look of the shiny leather,the different size straps.<br />i strongly recommend it.<br />i love this purse."
work very well and has lots of space for different bottles. was purchased for a baby shower and a \\must have\\ was cheaper here than in the stores.
we bought this for my 4 month old for christmas. she likes to get her hands under the bands. it's bigger than it looks. this sensory ball is great!
"actually my daughter loves it.  it does exactly what is needed, where it is needed.  easily keeps my granddaughter safely out of harm's way."
this is the second of this product. we are still using this for our son in us. my wife gifted a second one for her niece. they also love this.
this window dressing is adorable.  the colors are vibrant and bold and the quality is great.  a perfect addition to our zebra print decor.
"This is a great rattle! It's pretty large as far as rattles go and makes a nice rattle sound when shaken. My 5 month old has a hard time holding it because it's on the thick side, but he will grow into it."
"The pros:<br />Adorable appearance.<br />Good quality construction.<br />The pacifier stays attached, so you don't have to worry about dropping it on the floor and watching it bounce away (like the regular soothie does).<br /><br />The cons:<br />Occasionally my baby will accidently pull it out of her mouth because she gets ahold of the giraffe.  But this con is heavily outweight by the pros.<br />You cannot detach the pacifier from the toy for washing.  Some may not mind, but I do not wan't laundry soap residue on the pacifer.  Not a huge deal though, I'll just hand wash it.<br /><br />Overall, I would purchase more of these, and they would make a great gift if you know someone who is already using this type of pacifier."
I ordered this for my first grand daughter. Mahra took a liking to it quick. This is the one she prefer over the others.
These are such a great idea. My little one loves that she has something cuddly and soft to rub while sucking on her binky.  I also love that it helps her to be able to find it in her bed in the middle of the night.
"My son loves this, it's his favorite pacifier! I will be buying more of these. Everyone that sees it thinks it's so cute!!"
"We were given one of these pacifiers at the hospital and our son refused any other pacifiers once we got home.  We ordered the six pack because we couldn't sterilize the one fast enough to make the baby happy!  The package arrived quickly.  I like that these pacifiers do not have the deep bump at the end of the nipple (like the pacis meant for 3+ month babies), so they don't catch in his throat and gag him (which is what would happen with other regular shaped pacis)."
"We got a monkey for my son as a gift and he loves it. The problem was he would drop it all the time. We ordered a dragon and it was to stiff, no flexibility. We started looking for something like the monkey and the turtle workers amazing. Sits just right not heavy enough to fall out when you hold the baby upright."
"I like that this stays on my child's chest while she sleeps, so it doesn't wander too far (until she learns how to throw!).  Nice also to find it - very visible with the giraffe attached."
fast shipping and i love this jogger. it's so comforable and not as heavy as my regular stroller. fits easily in the back of my car too :)
"easy to assemble, only 4 screws to worry about, sturdy, my niece went crazy for it - great product!  would buy again!"
"this chair is cute and cozy, but certainly not for a toddler over three years old. it is much smaller than i thought. however, my little niece loves it, especially the rocking component. just a word of advise, you need a drill to attached the rocking chair component."
no leaks here (so far) and they are beautiful. my daughter especially loves the white 'peacock' one! easy to clean spouts too. seem a little roomier than some we have and you can see better if it's getting clean or not. good buy!
"my daughter was given a different style of this brand for easter of 2011.  she never goes anywhere without her.  i have to steal her away to throw her in the laundry lol.  we  bought her this style for christmas hopinng she would love her a much....now she carries both.  it is a very pretty doll and well made for the cost. perfect doll for a baby girl, soft with no parts that can come off.  difinitely would recommend."
i bought this because my 1 year old needed something before just being in the regular tub. this item is fantastic !<br />holds air and is very comfortable. he sits well in it.
this was a great addition on top of the wood floor in our playroom. as she got bigger we made different combinations. i even made cubes with them. easy to wipe and wash and soak in the sink for deeper cleaning.
"these work great for my 8 month old son. he loves the different feel of each block. some are noisy, some have mirrors, etc. great entertainment for him."
"this is a great gown for giving birth and i'm so glad i ordered it! i want to feel more like me on the day i deliver, and this comfy, nice looking gown is way better than any sterile, awkward hospital gown. i purchased mine in solid black and it looks really chic for what it is! (who knew you could describe a labor gown with the word 'chic' right?!) the cotton is super soft and i won't be showing the world my butt as i walk around in labor. great price, i recommend!"
The MAM brand are the best Pacifiers that I have found so far. My daughter used a Pacifier up until she was a year and a half. She tended to chew on them and other brands wouldn't hold up for very long before getting ripped up. These held up and are very durable. Was signed up for Amazon Mom so free shipping and this qualified to earn extra months of prime account.<br /><br />CJB
Love it! My grandson loves this. So glad I bought it. Thanks :) Will be back to buy more as needed.
"this pacifier has truly saved my life! my daughter loves that there is something to play with for extra comfort, and I love how much easier it is to find around the house. the reason I bought it was because of the fact that my daughter wakes up looking for her pacifier. with the extra weight, it stays in her mouth better and she gets a better night sleep. I would recommend this to anyone!"
These are the only binkies I could get my baby to take. There is no loop which seems to make other binkies too heavy causing them to fall out a lot. And I've been able to use other brands of pacifier clips with them as well.
I BOUGHT THIS PACIFIER AS A GIFT FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE. IT WORKS AS REPRESENTED AND IS A GREAT GIFT FOR ANYONE WITH A NEW BABY.
"We use this pacifier pod all the time. I had originally bought it to attach to the diaper bag but instead we have it on our daughter's carrier and it is so handy especially while riding in the car. I turned it inside out, machine washed it and laid out to dry and it holds up great!"
"My friend suggested this little dude and I was hesitant to purchase it after my dismay with a similar binky holder for the Tommee Tippees, but this guy is great!<br />After watching her daughter with hers I thought I would give it a try and I am so happy I did. My little guy uses this at nap time and sometimes at night when he sleeps in his swing (upright). He will randomly spit the binkie out when he is sleeping and freak out during the middle of the night to find it. As long as he has not swatted it away, he can easily find it on his chest.<br /><br />I have heard that it improves when they get a little older and have more hand control, right now he is 3 months and is able to grab it but often tosses it instead of bringing it to his mouth.<br /><br />The monkey is very cute and comes with an avent binkie attached. You cannot remove the binkie, but you can easily clean it with the monkey attached.<br /><br />I will purchase this for many a baby shower coming up as it has been a great item to have."
I BOUGHT THIS PACIFIER AS A GIFT FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE. IT WORKS AS REPRESENTED AND IS A GREAT GIFT FOR ANYONE WITH A NEW BABY.
"This was part of a donation that I gave to a therapy dog cause.  Hoping it helps the owners adjust to the way-too-early loss of their beloved Stacey Mae and the joy of their lovely little puppy, Kasey Mae!"
"Used the bear for the first time last night.  It really works!  Our newborn is already very mellow and even tempered, but he has been gassy because of bottle feeding.  He slept all night without a fuss (BTW, we switched to Dr. Brown's bottles yesterday too, and it works great as well.  No gassiness, fussiness, or anything!) The only thing about the bear, it does not shut off automatically, just like what others have said.  However, I don't see a problem with it.  Mother's heartbeat never quit either in the nine months he was in her.  It will run all night long with the generic batteries it came with.  Just buy a set of rechargeable AA batteries and you are good to go."
As a very young infant I would say helpful but could live wo.  As our daughter became 2 months old we seriously could not make it a day wo.  The pattern is interesting for development.  The stuffed animal makes so you don't have to put their pacifier back in 60 times.  They will just hold on themselves.
My son took to his wubbanub with ease. He loved the alligator and refuses to let any one play with it.
"If you want to use a pacifier.  We didn't, until a trip to the ER with the third baby.  Baby was screaming and they dipped one of these in sugar water and instantly calmed him.  Needless to say, we grabbed a handful before we left the hospital and love them for quick distraction during a diaper change or to calm him down when he has gas and a full belly so doesn't need any more milk."
so cute will occupy him while soothing him goes with all the other awesome things I have purchase from amazon.
they are nice and practical. very happy with the shopping. . . . . . . . .  . .
"Both my kids use this binky and now it has been discontinued.  They changed the whole style and shape of the &#34;binky&#34; brand, and it is nowhere near the same.  I have tried a lot of different binkys and my kids only want THIS one.  So what am I to do? Pay a ton for them on Amazon or Ebay, that's what."
My baby loves this little dog.  She likes being able to hold onto something when soothing herself with the pacifier.  I have three WubbaNubs and this one is a little smaller and lighter then the others (dragon and monkey) which would make it good for a preemie.
These paci's are amazing! My boy loves them!!! They are super cute and easy to clean too! Love love love!
"After getting used to these in the hospital, these are the only pacifiers our granddaughter will accept, so it's great to be able to buy the same one the hospitals use."
Great price!!! It looks just like the picture! It's perfect for a little girl. I can't wait to use this.
"These are the best pacifiers I've ever purchased! It has a great, solid base (for when my daughter is teething) and orthodontic nipple for soothing/naptime. I love that there is nowhere for air or saliva to get trapped, making these one of the most sanitary pacifiers you can have! They are definitely more expensive that the kind you'll find in Target, but I think they're worth every penny."
This is a great product! Perfect for babies and young kids. My nephew is only a few months old and he already learned to hold it and put it back in his mouth. Much easier than a regular pacifier
"So cute! And they are perfect fit and feel. Great value and wonderful gift idea! I wish they had more colors, because I would buy them all!"
This elephant so cute. We get comments and questions about it at least once a week. It also works as expected - it stays it a lot longer than other pacifiers. It is not as heavy as I expected but I am very pleased with it. Who knew my daughter would look so adorable with an elephant gaming from her mouth!
After searching for many different pacis we found these and boy are we never looking back.  ps no scent is great!
"I loved that my baby can hug the small stuffed animal and tuck the pacifier. She loved it. It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used.<br />I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe.<br /><br />BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Edited April 8, 2013:<br />I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie Pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though. My daughter stopped taking the pacifier around 4 months, but she loves to play with the tiny stuffed animal and chew on it sometimes :) So cute!"
"i love it and the price is cheaper,i will buy it next time,i wish the shipper will be faster next time."
"These are easy to find at night, you can buckle the animal part in the car seat with baby so you don't have to hunt it in the car! My boys both loved to just hold the light weight animal and used them for chew toys when teething!"
"These are AMAZING.  I love so many things about these pacifiers...First, they're all natural and BPA free.  They're also one solid piece.  There's no soapy water getting stuck inside the pacifier.  These are also GREAT for teething.  My son will take the pacifier out of his mouth throughout the night, gum and chew all over the pacifier and he never makes a peep.  They're extremely soothing.  They are bouncy, though!  We've gone through many because we lose them!  Save yourself the hassle of using other, hard plastic, pacifiers...just buy these!!!!  They're AMAZING."
If there were more stars to give I would!  The caterpillar was the first wubbie she had.  We got great use out of it.  My daughter was able to maneuver the pacifier and put in her mouth once falling out at a month or at least a little after one month old.  It's easy to spot if it happens to fall so losing it was pretty slim.  Once we started seeing the fabric starting to wear thin (this was after a year or so use) we replaced it...well that and because my husband and I are ber nostalgic we decided to replace the caterpillar with a new one so that we could keep her first and put it in her memory chest.<br /><br />We receive many compliments and questions as to where to purchase them.  I like to use them as part of a congrats on finding out your expecting/baby shower/new baby gifts because they aren't so mainstream so I find its a gift that stands out...parents love them...babies love them...
I thought this was a waste of money but our baby girl actually loved it more then her regular pacifiers
"Nice product! I love that.I always use this all year ,so I will buy this in the following days ,thank you ."
"My daughter can find these glow in the dark binkies by herself at night (started this at 6 months, right when we gave them to her)! they are awesome. Unfortunately the glow ones are only made in the 6 months and up size, I wish they came in 0+ and 2+ month sizes too."
I bought these as a gift and not only did the mom like them but the baby loved them as well
baby can't roll out. it has a great shape. easy to use. big enough to last quite awhile. i highly recommend over flat changing pads.
"my niece has tried many pacifiers but this one is her favorite. she is only 6 mons old but has developed a likeliness for this particular paci, so much so that she refuses to take any other. great product and a lifesaver , as my sister says."
"even though we only used it for a few months, it worked great, much easier than wrapping and she never got out.  she outgrew it before we were done using it, but she is a big baby.  love it."
this makes the superyard a little larger but does not interfere with getting around in the room.  this is being used for my puppy and it works great. very sturdy and safe for the puppy and anyone who needs to go in and out.
"we tried several sippy cups before finally finding one that my 17 month old daughter would use  our issue with other cups was that she likes to lay back in the morning and evening when she drinks her milk and all the other sippy cups flow to quickly.  this is the only cup that she can lay back, not have it drip, and drink without having to stop, swallow and start again."
"do not ask me why the medium size comes with the pump.  i do not have large nipples, but pumping is much more comfortable with the large.  also, my production went up with these."
"it not as big as the picture seems, but it still looks nice!...i added some flowers to the tree from another order just to give the room a little color, an wow, it looks great.. my daughter (4) love this....it looks like a shadow, to a 4 yr old the can be really scary waking up an seeing that in the middle of the night, so some pink flowers, an some birds...we love it"
if you have leather seats do yourself a favor and pick one of these up unless your leasing your vehicle and don't care about the condition you leave the back seat. the extra storage is nice up front and comes in handy. if you don't want it just tuck in under. well thought out design and has a nice feel to it.
highly recommend this product to anyone looking for one! arrived in said amount of time a well. thanks and god bless!
"use it for my 9 mo.old grandsons baby food. does great job,shipped quickly.small enough for a single serve or several days of foods."
"i got this for the kolcraft cozy crib mattress.  not only does it wash up terrific, but you couldn't ask for a better fit!"
"my husband talked me into getting this pump after my electric one wasn't cutting it. i finally gave in after reading the amazing reviews on it. i am so glad i got this pump. here's why;<br />this pump is so much quieter. with the electric one i couldn't even watch tv while i pumped, it was so loud. some of the reviews talked about this pump squeaking... that is nothing compared to the noise my electric pump makes.<br />this pump is so much faster than the electric and i love that i can control the length of the \\pull\\ on me. it works the best if i compress the handle for 2-3 seconds before releasing. this allows me to pump in about half the time<br />if you are contemplating a manual pump just give this one a try, it works so much better than i thought it would and it doesn't tire out my hands as i thought it would.<br />please know i only pump twice a day,in the morning because he only nurses on one side then and i pump for his last feeding of the night so he can get a good feeding in and so my husband can get in on the feeding action; so i'm not sure how well it would work if you need to pump all the time."
"Good camera, even in the dark, and very good sound, it does not have any interference. The product  is great."
"If your child takes a pacifier, I can almost guarantee they will love any of these animal pacifiers! But be sure to get at least two of them because, they will not take any other after they use these. And as we all know sometimes one gets missed placed, lost, left at grandma's,etc.. They love to hold the animal on the end. It comforts them and becomes a friend. They are machine washable and are well worth the money."
I bought the wubbanub for my sister's son and he loves it! It is easy to manipulate and super cute!
"Certainly is useful to be able to tuck it in to keep the pacifier from disappearing... take note that the pacifier is bonded into the critter, so that it can not be changed or separated from the plush toy portion."
I bought this pacifier for my 5 month old nephew. It's the only paci that he will take in his mouth. He loves it!
"Certainly is useful to be able to tuck in to keep the pacifier from disappearing... take note that the pacifier is bonded into the critter, so that it can not be changed or separated from the plush toy portion."
Great prices! I would recommend to others and would use again in the future... My lil son loves these pacifiers!
My daughter loves these binkies. They are great! Watch out if you have a dog. They seem to like them also...
"We have tried so many types of pacifiers. Our little one liked many of them, but loves this kind. It may just be a personal preference, but he loves them!  Plus they are super easy to clean and very durable since they are all rubber. And there isn't anywhere for germs to build up since its all one piece. They are a little pricier, but last forever and keep our little one super happy. I'd highly recommend:-)"
"These were the only pacifiers our baby liked, I just had multiple because I seemed to misplace often. The best part about these are the same as the wubbanubs use."
My daughter loves the wubbanub pacifier animals...they are the only pacifiers she will use.  They have saved my husband and I much time finding the dropped/hidden pacifier with the nice size stuffed animal.  They also have lasted several washings!  We especially love the giraffe but the lamb is perfect for smaller hands on your little one.
we bought two of these as gifts for our children's newborns.  it was the best gift we could have given.  this monitor works great!
i'm so happy to have extra parts! it makes pumping that much easier and take the hassle out of having to clean up after each time.
this arrived just as pictured and described. what a lovely gift for my first granddaughter. :) i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special gift for a new baby.
"these cups are great! i didn't expect them to be 100% spill proof but they are!<br />my wife can carry this cup in her purse and there was no 1 drop leaking out and the cup didn't stay upright all the time.<br /><br />i tried to drink out of them and it is easy, so no worries that baby will suck hard and get nothing out.<br /><br />the shape is great for little hands to hold it, they are easy to clean, colors are universal- get them!:)"
i love having extra parts it making using the pump that much easier. they fit great and arrived in record time.
this car seat was purchased to be used for our grandchildren when they come to town.  it is great for that purpose. the price is right.
this is a great product for just children who are just starting to teeth. it is just big enough to fit in their mouths so they can chew on it! it almost looks like a pacifier when they have it in their mouths!
excellent product and price and i love the fact that i can carry all my brushes together (and add some that didnt come in the kit)
great bids if your baby is like a st. bernard! it has the plastic on the inside of the terry cloth so it wont run onto your babies clothing.
"had the tommee tippee cups for a bit, got these and switched over. you can see how much liquid is left inside, and they are easy to clean and put together. milk can splatter a bit if the child lets go of the straw before the liquid is finished, but only the amount between the valve and straw end (1.5&#34; worth), so much better than most!"
"i first got this product as a gift when my first child was born.  i used it for so many years.  there are seven years between my girls.  once the older daughter grew out of bottles i used it for small items like small dipping cups, medicine cups, and other small items that needed a safe place to take a bath in.  when my second child came along, i again received one as a gift.  it's just a great little baskets to store small things you put in the dishwasher. from bottle pieces to shot glasses, it does the trick.  i have actually given several at a gift myself to new moms,  i love this little product and am pretty sure one will always live in my dishwasher.  they hold up and last, plus are a great price!"
"i purchased this after my 4 month old daughter loved playing with the one at my sister's house.  it has been great.  it keeps her attention with all the different parts.  she'll chew on the antlers, the feet, the tail, etc.  this is our go-to toy when we leave the house.  he hooks easily onto our playmat or our stroller.  a good investment!"
"Can't say whether these things sterilize or not, but they do work well for cleaning pacifiers, teethers, and anything else you kid may like to put in their mouth and possibly drop or be touched by another kid. The little pack they come it keeps the wipes moist for a very long time. We don't use them as much now as we did when our daughter was younger, but still keep them on hand. Have a pack that was opened a year ago and wipes are still wet and ready to use. They are kind of like baby wipes you use for changing diapers but without the soapy like feeling so there shouldn't be a bad taste when your kid puts the item back in their mouth after being cleaned with these. Don't believe me, try cleaning a pacifier, teether, or other object with a regular wipe, then with these and see which time your kid makes a frumpy face. :-)"
"My daughter never wanted to use a pacifier, not to bite, now this new release, I like very much, given much attention."
"This seems to by my infants sons favorite pacifier - and the only one I don't seem to lose :) It's easy to find, when digging through the diaper bag, or spot, in the house. Love it. Highly recommend."
My daughter is a preemie and she does very well with these pacifiers. They are easy to keep in and soft enough for her to use.
"My oldest son was not a paci baby, but our newborn daughter is! She loves her soothie and so we wanted to try the WubbaNub since it would help it stay in place. The animal isn't as weighted as a beanie baby, but it is great for keeping it in her mouth in the car or when rocking her to sleep or when wearing her in my baby carrier as I often do since we have an older brother to keep up with :-) My only concern is how to wash it, but I plan to just dip the nipple in boiling water and spot clean the lamb as the instructions say. I do wish you could replace the pacifier after a while since you are only supposed to use them for a few months due to the integrity of the nipple possibly decreasing. But so far we love it!"
"My son's room is decorated in knights, castles and dragons so this was perfect! He never really took a liking to pacifiers but this looks great in his room!"
These were hit with everyone especially the parents of newborns.  Lots of photos were taken with the MUTE and laughs...What a nice idea.
my 6 month old can grab it easily and suck on it or play with it. Great gift for new babies
"Super quick shipping! Bought as a shower gift, and the parents LOVED it! Would def reccomend this to anyone who wants something 'different'"
My daughter loves these pacifiers won't take any other kind. She snuggles the stuffed animal when sleeping and holds their hands while awake and playing or driving in the car. My recommendation to all new moms.
"My daughter would only use soothie or gumdrop pacifiers, so the wubbanubs were very helpful.  We have the elephant and the lamb and she loves them both.  She has switched from pacifiers to sucking on her fingers now, but still loves to hold the wubbas.  They are perfect for her little hands."
My son was given these in the hospital and he loves them. Love that they came five in a pack and were reasonably prices compared to babies r us.
My grandchildren love these Pacifiers and so does my daughter. They are practically never lost. Would buy again and suggest to friends.
We loved the first one so much we bought three more! I just wish they were a little heavier(our boy is a moose!)
"The only thing I wish was that it was a bit heavier, but other than that the baby loves it...we ordered three more!"
I love these pacifiers and these aer the only ones that my son will take. These are easy to clean and cheap!
We have a few these for our son(different designs obviously) and got this for our niece...i'm sure she'll love it too!
"Every OU football fan will want these cute Sooner pacifiers for their baby! The baby hasn't arrived yet, so I can't attest to how well he will like them, but I have pulled and twisted on them to be sure they won't fall apart. They look great, no sharp edges, and delivery was fast."
"Daddy wanted these binkies for his baby boy, but fortunately baby boy didn't like these binkies. But they are very cute."
I literally have probably 10 of these lying around the house at all times. A nurse had given me one in the hospital with him and I immediately bought more. Unfortunately my dogs love them too so I have to keep buying more but these are amazing!
"I ordered this to keep a couple of pacifiers within easy reach in the diaper bag and it has worked out great.  The little bag fits perfectly in one of the large front pockets of the Skip Hop diaper bag.  It easily holds 2 pacifiers (I use the Avent Soothies).  I have not used the strap to attach the bag to anything, so I can't comment on the use of that.  Overall, very pleased with my purchase and received timely delivery from Amazon (as always)."
Just like the ones in the hospital except with a cutout for the nose.  Exactly what our son was looking for :-)
It's just so cute to see my eight week old hold the lamb by one of its legs.  I love this pacifer.
"this is a wonderful pacifier, i'd recommend starting with this from the get go..my baby loves natural rubber pacifiers and won't touch the silicone ones, this has a nice one piece construct so its easy to keep clean."
This was given as a baby shower gift and the mom and dad of twins loves this!  Great gift for all!
"we have been using this brand and kind for two years since my baby was born. these are good. slicon doesnt hurt her face. soft and colors are good. after they were off, we get new ones."
"My daughter LOVES this.  It is easy for her to hold on to, easy to find in bed in the middle of the night, and soft and cuddly!"
"My son is not a big fan of pacifiers, and was not loving the Avent 0-6 mo one, but this one was a hit! It has an intresting shape, I want to believe it's safe for the growing teeth."
"Great product!  Very happy with the purchase, great for the little Lion fan! I recommend for all who are avid football fans!!"
When we first tried this non-contact thermometer we double checked it's accuracy with a contact thermometer. After a few times we found that this thermometer was very accurate and needed no further verification. Temperatures can be taken when the baby is sleeping.
My daughter absolutely loves this binky. She was able to grab it and put it in her mouth a lot sooner than a regular pacifier.
"My daughter LOVES both of her WubbaNubs.  She has this giraffe and the monkey.  She plays with them and teethes on their various appendages.  Whoever came up with these is a genius.  So much easier for her to hold on to!  Both of our WubbaNubs have been through the wash many times and have held up to some rough treatment also.  I don't put them in the dryer, but they dry within a few hours anyway.  Great product and every baby should have one."
My baby five months old and He love this blanket so much... Great baby item and easy to clean. We call this blanket with &#34;Blanky: :)
I love this product! My granddaughter uses the Avent pacifier and this is the only pacifier holder that works. I would  recommend this product!
She said she show it to her GYN doctor and the dr told her this was the best one on the market right now she loves it now she want the bottles also by Avent
My daughter has 4 different WubbaNub pacifiers (or binkies as we call them).  She's been using them since she was a few months old & they were perfect for those late nights when her binky would fall out & she was able to push it back into her mouth & go right back to sleep.  I had used the plain soothies with nothing attached when she was first born & I spent countless nights being woken up because she lost her binky & couldn't get it back.  These are great.  About once a week I toss them in my lingerie wash bag & wash them & they come out practically dry.  About an hour on a drying rack & they're good to go.  Do not put other items in the bag though because any fuzz or lint will cling to the pacifier part & you'll have to rinse it off.  I usually rinst them off in hot water anyway right after they've gone through the wash.
"I love horror movies and bought this pacifier for my son. I love that vampire boy, so does my wife."
"My daughter loves the WunnaNub's plush doll cat and we love it as well.  It is big enough so we don't lose it, which saves on the cost of the other lost cheaters. Great product for parents."
The baby pacifiers are great and of great quality and are cute for my baby. I love the graphics and most of all I love the timing
"Great quality stuff, it looks great and it's not going to fall apart anytime soon. Woo hoo! It's so fun!"
"When my son was born in 2008, the hospital gave us one of these and he loved it. I just had a baby girl and searched like CRAZY to find these again, and she loves them just as much as he did!"
"We love that this paci is exactly the brand my son loves, doesn't fall far if it falls out of his mouth, and is easy to find in the night because if the sie and feel."
Super cute and baby loves it. It's so cute when she holds into the dragon. This is actually the second one that we bought; needed a backup (just incase).
What more can I say. This was a super cute pacifier that didn't look like one. My daughter used this for so long! The shape was perfect for her and the elephant gave her something to hold on to and snuggle. Highly recommend despite the cost. It's well worth it.
This is a great accurate product.  I was skeptical at first but I am now a believer.  So easy even a cave man can use it!
This is cute and my great grandson's mother loved it.  The skull isn't too big or scary and the nipple is the right shape.
"Wonderful because my four month old son could manipulate it himself after just a few days. Saved lots of time searching for a pacifier, especially when driving!"
"My 9 month old son absolutely LOVES this pacifier. I bought the doggie one for him when he was 5 months old and added the giraffe and dinosaur to his collection a couple of months later. These pacifiers have been of great help to us because my baby wakes up several times during the night looking for his pacifier. Most of the time, he wasn't able to find or grasp the regular pacifiers, so he would start crying and we would have to get up and help him. Since we bought these pacifiers, we don't have to get up anymore. He finds them quickly and can easily put them on. Sometimes, we find him asleep with two pacifiers on at the same time, super cute!"
Great!  Baby's second one. Had to get a duplicate. Easy for him to hold and less likely to loose. Thanks!
"So, my newborn son has a tiny tongue and is NOT a fan of these.  That being said, they're still amazing pacifiers.  My daughter used them for 10 months and would take no other.  The caps are easy to get on and off, the handle is a good size, and they were easy for her to handle."
My Grandson was born just a couple days ago and has to be kept in the NICU.  It is very conforming to me that soon as they turn on his dexbaby bear he settles down and looks relaxed.
This pacifier is really cute. Gets lots of loughs. It's kinda' small so it's good for 0-6 months i think.
This is a great buy. Our baby only wants these and won't take any other pacifier. they are excellent quality and certainly recommended.
"Our baby loves the binky and therefore we always travel with one. Somehow we constantly lose them. This WubbaNub is the perfect solution. It's easy for him to navigate into his mouth and we never lose sight of it. He even finds it in the dark to stuff back into his mouth when he's half awake. They come in different animal shapes too. Love it!<br /><br />If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com.

". I had purchased EVERY SINGLE brand and style of pacifier.  My daughter refused them all except the soothies. The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part.<br />2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry. I washed our monkey this way.<br />3. Washing machine : put in garment bag and wash.  Let air dry. Do not put in dryer."
"I use these for my baby because they have lots of strength so he can really bite down, they last, and they are made of natural rubber. Thanks!"
"You can not buy these in stores. They come from a medical supplier.<br /><br />I've tried so many different kinds of pacifiers, and have still ended up with two finger suckers! This pacifier was the closest I ever got to getting my infants to suck well and contently."
the baby loves this. the monkey makes it more easy to keep track of and also helps somewhat with keeping her from spitting it out.
Great colors--requested by soon-to-be-mother. Should be better for baby not to swallow air like old pacifers. Ordered several so there will always be a spare.
"Surprised our daughter-in-law at her baby shower. She used the skull in a lot of her decorating, so this was a fitting gift."
My son is 4 months old and he loves this blanket. He like to hold on to things while hes using his pacifier and it makes him feel comfortable. I love how it has the pacifier holder and teething corners. I would suggest this to anyone. Thanks
I bought my daughter other brand pacifiers with fancy color and designs. However she loves this one the most.  I believe it has to do with the texture and design. Easy to clean.
I recommend this product to anyone and everyone. I luckily haven't had to use this product to much but sometimes when I see it I use it just for the heck of it each time I use it I still get the same great accurate results.
"These are the only pacifiers my baby will take and these came faster then they said, only 3 days! Great service, great product!"
Nice finishing. It works for what it was ment to be. My baby is 3 weeks old and this still a bit big for him but in 2 more weeks I am sure it will fit him perfect
pillow was great while pregnant and is still being used after baby!  makes sleeping very comfortable.  my daughter loved it.
"we previously had a summer infant video monitor but after just a few months of use it started to malfunction and lose signal just feet from the camera. i decided to splurge on this monitor and i have now had it almost a year. i have not had any issues at all with signal issues, malfunctions or anything. it has been a great monitor. the camera is awesome and i can see my daughter breathing while she sleeps. the pan/ tilt option is great as she moves around her crib often and the night vision is perfect. i can see if she has pulled a blanket over her face or she threw her pacifier out of her crib. overall i would recommend this to all parents looking for a reliable monitor that doesn't malfunction like the rest on the market these days."
"i bought these cups to get my 2 year old daughter to start learning to drink from a more regular type cup instead of her \\sippy straws\\ and \\sippy cups.\\  these are closer to drinking from the real thing, but with a lid.  note:  this product is not spill proof!  i didn't expect it to be! the lids just slow spills down.  it is a training cup for toddlers, not a spill proof sippy cup.  it is exactly what i was looking for!!!! they're dishwasher safe and microwave safe.  i love these cups!  very happy with the purchase!"
we used this gate to block off our tv and dining room.  easily positionable and easy to install.  love it.  well worth the cost.
"started off w a different nursing bra that used a velcro closure, which i found so annoying.  besides being loud, it also was a snag hazard while you opened/closed it.  so first, i love this bra's zipper closure.  the black fabric is thick and stretchy, so supportive and comfy.  the design is also very effective ... no worries about shield or bra slippage, even though i use it without the optional shoulder straps. this is def a 5 star bra!"
"my poor little baby girl started teething at 2 months old...bummer! she wasn't really  aware of holding things at this time so i struggled to find something she could chew on easily. i tried a lot of things people suggested but couldn't find anything she liked (besides my knuckle). i happened to have this teether on hand since it got so many good reviews. so i decided to work with her on holding it by wrapping her hand around the neck repeatedly and by 2 1/2 she was (somewhat) able to hold it in her mouth all on her own! now at 3 1/2 months she loves it and will chew on the face and leg very happily! i am so pleased!! she also loves the squeaky sound it makes! and with food grade inks and all natural rubber, what more could you want!?<br /><br />what a wonderful teething toy!!!"
"i have a kindergarten teacher.  these have been a wonderful investment and time saver.  i use them in stations for sight word, letter, and number games.  i have not had any problems with the papers falling out when the students roll them.  they are great!!"
"i keep two of these bags in my purse for when i'm out with my boys and we buy a snack they need to share. i used to get so frustrated searching the car for an extra cup, or something to divide out their snack with. these bags are great because they don't take up any room. the kids enjoy them too! they are easy to clean -- either wipe out with a damp cloth, or wash (hang dry). and they do well with fruits and dry snacks. we just have one set of \\mini\\ bags and that's been fantastic for our needs."
it' s a really great blanket.  it' breathable and warm at the same time.  it's also big and soft and withheld many washings.
my son loves when i stick this in his mouth and sing the brush your teeth song. it tickles his gums. we have been using it since he first got teeth at 7 months and we add it into the routin. he really likes to bite on it.
i love these i bought 2 threw them in the wash and dried them too no shrinking and no wrinkles! love them
"lots of carriers on the market. we tried several. each infant is different and what works for one may not for another. our infant son loves the boba. nothing else we tried compares. it reduces nap time stress for parent and infant. if he's fighting we just plop him in the boba and boom, nap.  he also just loves to ride in it while we work around the house.  he can watch everything from a safe spot. he loves riding on back. incredibly comfortable to wear. very heavy duty. very adjustable and easy to adjust so either of us can throw it on quick.  seems expensive but honestly, if it were three times as much it would be worth every penny. we've been using it for 6 months and a family member still uses hers on her 2 yr old so it lasts forever.  saying the boba &#34;changed our lives&#34; seems dramatic; but it did."
"This mattress fits our Graco Pack N Play perfectly, no gaps all around.  This mattress is a huge improvement over the thin,cardboard like mattress pad that come with the pack n play.  I highly recommend purchasing the American Baby Company Organic Interlock Pack N Play sheet to go with it."
"we love this monitor! especially because it lets us know the temp in our child's room, which really came in handy the other night when our heater went out. we also love the two way communication. now when our child wakes up in the middle of the night, i am able to soothe her back to sleep without even leaving my bed. wish we bought this one a long time ago. we had a summer video monitor & it broke."
i love these utensils!  they're just right for my two-year old daughter!  i've tried a number of other ones but these are #1!
works great. suction works well but not to hard to where i am worried that take to much of a suction. that was my number one concern and my friend recommend this kind.
"i love the convenience of just zipping the sheet on and off as needed.  i am over 50 and raising my grandson for a little bit.  i am short and can barely reach over the side of the crib so the ability to just replace the part of the sheet that is being slept on, compared to wrestling with the entire mattress, is a big help.  the sheets wash up nicely.  i do take the mattress out at least once a month to wash the entire sheet that sits under the mattress, that's when i rotate the mattress or turn it over.  so easy to manage.  yes, i would recommend this to a friend."
i purchase this for my niece & their parents like it very much while her father is driving she was in save as she sleeps<br />& she use it as a toy
i've begun using this instead of the giant genie.  each stinky diaper is safely sealed and thrown away.  i've hung it above the trashcan for convenience.  i've got one in the diaper bag too.  it really helps with my older son's pull ups too.
this was a great tool. of course its medela and they have just about perfected the paraphernalia needed by nursing moms. these were a great addition to the ones i already had.
"i bought this to make sure my 17 month old didn't take off in the book store or the mall.  it's great, although don't tug too hard because the little ones will just keep going and fall back.  still, it's great as an added safety measure and the best part is that my daughter absolutely loves &#34;piggie&#34;.  she kisses him and hugs him every chance she gets and it's never a struggle to get her to wear it."
fits nicely my bugaboo. i bought it here half price- the original price is about 90$ -sweet!<br />love the color- dark brown.
"the structure of this bottle is great in minimizing stomach issues:  colic, burping, reflux, etc., and we've tried lots (tommy tippee, avent, medela).  dr. brown knows best."
"great seat and super comfy for my 4 year old. recommended by the national highway traffic safety administration. cheaper than britax, but quality just as good!"
"immediately soft, adorable pattern, and just the right weight for a spring/summer baby.  we used these as swaddled, burp cloth, shades over the carrier, wind shield, and even as a sling support (over a moby wrap).  they have held up well in frequent washes, pack small, and have a lovely textured surface that baby loves to explore.  now that its cold, these are being layered under heavier blankets like a sheet.  very light fabric works great for us since our little one likes to pull blankets over her head."
"what other stroller can you push with one hand and still be able to control? none that i am aware of. my family owns a single bob revolution so when i found out i was expecting twins i knew this was the stroller for me. i cant wait until summer comes and we can hit the outdoors. love the ride, the new canopies, and the ease of use. granted it is a little larger, but i have a ford edge and with this sitting on its side it takes up no more space than any other double stroller i have owned."
my son got this for his first birthday and he adores it.  he cries if we take it away.  he can't even ride it yet.  he pushes it all around the house.  we do have hard wood floors and when he gets it onto carpet it does look a little less fun as it takes more effort.
got this for grandbaby for christmas. i am sure she will love it. this is her first christmas. can wait to see her face when she opens it.
"not only does look really cute on the little ones it seems to really soothe my son, sometimes!! i love it! it goes with everything he wears! i'll be getting the bracelet soon."
"firefly is so cute!  bright colors. and it hangs on car seat, stroller, pack n play,our baby loves to reach for it."
"this is my second baby with nuk binkies. love them, the best part is the little ring can be stuck on a finger for easy holding while feeding the baby. you do not have to do the search and find after the feeding is over. love them!"
"this is the best crib sheet i have ever bought. i have had multiple crib sheets that just aren't up to par. every single one of them doesn't fit over my daughters mattress without a lot of stretching, struggling and effort. this sheet fits perfectly and it is so soft. i love this sheet so much to the point that when i wash it i don't put another sheet on, i just wait for this one to finish in the washer and dryer. so i decided to buy two more for her crib. i have another baby on the way and i bought a sheet for her crib and one exactly like this for her cradle as well. it is a must buy in my book!"
for my grandson he loves his bath time now. he laughs and plays.  giggles.  he is a joy to watch.
"very cute bath toy for a frog fan.  floats and hasn't gotten icky yet, though it may just be a matter of time, bath toys just seem to do that.  great price too."
"a pump bra is a must if you plan on pumping at all.  this one is not pretty, but it's super functional.  i would usually put it on over a zip-up sweatshirt to keep warm while pumping, so the adjustable feature is nice.  this thing is a brilliant invention.  you won't regret it."
"i could not sleep at night without this monitor!  it's an amazing invention!  i rest easy knowing my son is safe in his bed.  it has gone off before because of extremely light breathing, but it's still worth it!  i would rather get scared a couple of times and it be nothing then wake up and it be something...  thank you for having it at an affordable price!"
"we use these often for our twins.  they are a nice size for the beginning eater, and the coating on the spoon seems to be kind to little gums.  one of our babies chews on the spoon when eating, and so far the coating has not shown any wear.  the white did stain when we ate carrots.  i like that the handle is made of recycled materials, and that it was made in the usa."
"i have been through so many different shaker bottles, and they all get broken or chipped quickly from me dropping them especially the cheap gnc ones. these bottles are tuff, i have dropped them several times when full and they have not broken. the extra compartments are really convenient too, i use them to hold my protein. if you need a shaker this is the one."
both of my grandson's have this and what a great product.  it uses minimal water and yet the baby feels warm and secure.
"my grandson is a handful.  he likes to run around in public places, and short of carrying him everywhere, i have no way to keep him by my side.  this safety strap allows him to run around, but not too far.  he has the freedom to walk, which makes him happy, and i keep him close, which makes me happy.  it has saved my back, and saved us from having to chase him.  it's the perfect product."
"i am an experienced grandmother of nine, who always loved these for my our children and grandchildren and i also did home visiting for at-risk moms and toddlers who loved learning to call out names and colors and to compare sizes and have conversations about stacking up, falling down, nesting, etc.  we like that there are eight cups, with numbers on the bottom and a great learning tool!  recently i bought two more sets - for my niece and for my sister who is also a wonderful grandma needing more good toys in her home."
"we have two kids, and have gone through 5 or 6 different baby monitors, before finally getting this one. the others were all analog, and cheap, and had a lot of problems with static, range etc.<br />this monitor works great - there is no static whatsoever, and it easily covers our entire 4 bedroom house and the yard. another neat little feature, which my 3.5 year old son likes a lot is the two-way radio capability, which i use every morning when he wakes up to acknowledge his presence, and he cracks himself up.<br />5 stars, don't waste time and money with cheaper products."
"i bought these to go with my chocolate/kona organic ergobaby carrier for my daughter's drool problem. she loves sucking on them, they are resistant, easy to remove and wash. i highly recommend them."
"these bags made all of my wildest breastmilk pumping and storing dreams come true!  i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

"i gave this to some friends who just had a baby.  their experiences with it have all been good.  babies, apparently, like it when you hold them.  holding them usually takes hands, but this baby carrier does the whole holding part and suddenly dishes and other basic tasks become possible.  apart from free hands, my friends mentioned that adjusting and fitting the carrier straps was easy.  the only downside is that if the baby does not want in he can make it difficult to use, but this does not sound like a defect which can be held against the product designer as much as it can be held against the baby.<br /><br />my friends' baby is still more interested in looking at his parents, but when he really starts checking out the world they like the idea that he can be turned around to look at what they are doing.<br /><br />a perfect baby shower gift, but for very young or small babies note that there is a minimum weight of 8 lbs."
these bins are easy to assemble.  i ordered 12 of them for a wall of my playroom.  only 1 arrived with hardware missing.  customer service online was quick and easy and the hardware arrived quickly.  it's much easier to keep toys off the floor now.
"when you look at our 11 month old, he does look swallowed up in this item, but it works great.  it keeps him warm, gives him plenty of room to wiggle, and he's able to walk.  we have not had an issue with the legs falling down."
"i had initially purchased a simple wishes hands free breastpump bra but returned it due to: 1. poor fit, 2. fabric lint sticking to the pump parts. as soon as i returned that one, i needed to look for a replacement that was going to work better for me. i found pumpease. it comes in pretty colors and patterns which i like. this product just works. easy to use. good fit. comfortable."
very comfortable for baby and me! easy to get baby in and out of. love that it works both ways for baby to face me or face out. this is a life saver at the grocery store. my son gets upset in the store with all the attention and noise and by the 3 isle he's crying if he's in his car seat in the cart. with this carrier he is close to me looking at me the whole time and it stops people from getting in his face. with this carrier we make it through the whole store with no tears! we've been using it now for about two months (he's almost 7 months old) and he and i love it! it also comes in handy for walks that don't have a sidewalk or path for the stroller.  i definitely recommend!
this chair is great to store flat for when the grandbaby comes.  it does not take up much space and it works really well on our table.
"just picked this item up, along with the flower, to complement our grass drying rack for baby bottle parts.  it is a godsend- the small branches are perfect for bottle nipples and collars, and that frees up tons of space for more bottles or more parts.  if like us you have dr. brown bottles, you'll know how much of a pain they are due to the number of parts you have to clean and dry.  highly recommended."
"well, the whales &#34;have it!&#34;  my one month old granddaughter sleeps like a baby (haha!) while the whales are singing!  as soon as it is turned off, she wakes up until it is turned back on!  a must have!!"
the bassinet cover was as beautiful as it is in the picture and of very  good quality. it was shipped safely and very quickly.
"i love this wearable blanket.  it's very soft and warm, and not static as acrylic is.  i wish they made them in bigger sizes, i can't find anything like it anymore."
"very cute, i will enjoy putting my baby in this. i originally bought it because of it's unisex quality when i wanted to be surprised, but that didn't last long. my son will look adorable."
"i left this outside all summer and most of fall.  our child loved it. i ordered a second one for our home.  it'd durable, quality, and has some substance to it.  i threw out some thin mats we had purchased before this one.    update: it's two years later, the kids still like these, and they still look great.  they are very easy to clean."
"after buying a smaller diaper bag, i decided to purchase a larger bag since i'm expecting twins. so far i love it!!!"
"I bought pack n plays to use while camping and was afraid that my twin boys wouldn't not sleep well in them since they are used to sleeping in a crib. I bought this mattress to use since they would sleep in their pack n play for a week at a time. When I first opened the box I was afraid they were to soft. But once I laid my son down on it, it did not sag or give in so I was not afraid to use it on my 4 month old twins. In fact they slept better on this mattress than they do at home. I ended up buying 2 of these for both boys and for the price I am happy with my purchase."
"My little one adores this paci. She had the teddy bear and loved it so I purchased this one to add to her collection. Cute, good quality, easy to clean."
"Sometimes the pacifier or a toy get a little too gunky to give right back to the child right away, but the kid just wants it. These are great to keep around for a quick wipe down and they don't have that strong cleaner smell."
These pacifiers aren't just cute.  The tiny stuffed animal helps to keep the pacifier in the babies mouth.  It is much easier for babies to grab the animal and then wriggle the pacifier back into their mouth (so you don't have to.) When they do have them in the animal rests on their chest and helps to keep the pacifier there.  The pacifier part is the same kind that they give you in the hospital.  My daughter would never take a pacifier but my son did and he loved these.
"They are lifesavers.  They are cute to look at, and fun for the kids.  Plus they really help the little ones who don't quite have the motor skills to put their pacifiers in their own mouths.  These are much bigger and even the younger babies can manage to push them back in.  And they're easier to catch before they hit the ground."
"It's amazing, it works exactly as they advertise!!! It really closes when it's dropped, the plastic closure pieces somewhat press on my baby's cheeks but I think it's because he has a fat face"
We are diehard Cowboys fans and I had to order these for my new grandson! My son n law wasn't too happy...lol
These have lasted forever!! They are all one piece so you don't have to worry about them falling apart and being inhaled or swallowed. Easy to clean and disinfect. My daughter keeps hers around at all times.
"This is the only pacifier that my little girl will take. Not only is it drop dead adorable, but she loves the nipple on it!"
"i knew exactly what i wanted when i was going to get baby monitor for my baby daughter. i searched both for a video and audio monitor and decided on the samsung sew-3037. as far as i am concerned, i don't mind spending a little bit more as long as i am getting what i paid for. with this in mind, i quickly decided not to go with an audio monitor. i think the option to monitor my child with both video and audio would worth the extra money i spend. then focusing my attention on the video monitors, i settled between on the samsung sew-3037 for several reasons.<br /><br />before making the purchase i looked at the features  of the monitor. the monitor offered a great range and an interference free connection. it also has some features that really tweeked my interest. i thought the two way talk feature was pretty useful and the fact that you can connect up to four cameras really got me thinking about the various potential uses of this system. (maybe not only as a baby monitor). lastly, it had the vox feature that i didn't know too much about but it got me interested. it said something about noise cancellation and i wondered how that would work. lastly, i was very excited about the ptz feature on the cameras.<br /><br />as for design, i believe samsung's monitor looks sleek and elegant. the black on white really makes the monitor look like a quality product. the overall design of the camera, the color, and shape of the monitor is sharp, and the four way directional button to control the camera is very convenient and easy to use.<br />why i decided to go with samsung: i purchased the sew-3037 because of three reasons.  as a company, i trust samsung. they know how to make electronic products. i love their tv and i love their phones. i figured, they'd do a great job on this as well. secondly, the overall image quality, the ptz feature, and the vox feature. lastly, the monitor being expandable to four camera system.<br /><br />after receiving the monitor: i love it. i tested it for a couple of days and i can't stop playing with it. the overall video and audio quality on the camera is very good. the range hasn't given us any problems and we have a pretty sizeable house. i don't believe it's available now, but i definitely plan to purchase more cameras. the vox is a great feature. it saves battery so you get a good couple of hours on the monitor. it also keeps things quietly and goes into sleepmode when my daughter isn't making any noise for a minute or two. then it comes alive again if she stirs. you can set the sensitivity and also turn it off all together.<br /><br />the feel of the cameras and the monitor is solid, not flimsy at all. the color and design is as i thought, very sleek. i love the look of the camera. i'm thinking i'm going to find other uses for it even after my daughter gets older. i think this was a great buy and definitely will recommend it to my friends."
"i have had three of these bibs and they are great. they last a long time and are easy to clean. these are better than other plastic bibs because of the snaps. you can unsnap it to clean it thoroughly. you can even put them in the wash. they have a lifetime guarantee which i didn't take advantage of yet, but will for the next bib that gets worn. one bib last me about 1 year of dailly use before it was so worn i had to throw it out."
"i have a medela manual pump that i got from the hospital, it hurts! i was then turned off from pumping however with my second baby, i decided to try an electric pump and i am so glad i did! i read many many reviews and decided to pay a bit extra for this pump because of all the positive reviews. the instructions are easy to follow and it is not noisy. i pumped with my two babies fast asleep next to me. i am relieved to have found this pump so now hubby and i can have a life again!"
"perfect for newborn, easy to put on, better than using wraps, good quality, will probably last till she is 3-4 months old"
this dummy is hilarious. i bought it as a joke for a friend and i'm sure it will be well received. hope she uses it on the baby becaise it will look hilarious!!
"it's been a month since we purchased this carseat. our daughter seems to like it.<br />it looks very comfy. based on the safety ratings, it's one of the best out there.overall, it is a very good carseat.<br />i just wish it was a little easier to carry around - we live in nyc and rent a car whenever we travel, so carrying it around is not comfortable. it is bulky and big, but this is true for any convertible seat on the market. we didn't have a problem fitting it into the car.<br />update. so far we drove mazda 3, honda civic, audi 3 and had no problem fitting this car seat in the back seat."
i had this product when my children were babies and loved it then!  you can use a regular bathtub hands free and the babies love being submerged in warm water.
"i was expecting them to be in different colors, but white will do. these were supposed for children, not adults. i mean i have read the descriptions and reviews, i'm not complaining. now i'm using these for my scarfs and belts; they are good!"
this sheet matches sooo well with our room decor it is sooo pretty. we are very pleased with it. we just love it.
"i received this as a gift from a hospital when my child was born. i tried swaddling my baby with a regular blanket numerous times, but i was too exhausted to fix it over and over. i loved this so much that i ordered two more; one with micro-fleece and one made out of 100% cotton. my daughter wears it on a daily basis and keeps her warm."
light weight and very very convenient. it is &#34;must haves&#34; when you have a bay in a capsule. love the big basket at the bottom. highly recommend it.
just got this monitor because it had all the features i wanted for 3 month old girl and it was a great deal.<br />it works great so far and i would recommend it for anyone with a baby.
used for a 12 hr each way trip with a 20 lb 12 month old.  worked great and she slept well in it.  have  it in a van pilot-type seat and it fits easily.
"previous bath toys were getting old and yukky, so these cute, colorful and soft bath toys were just the right bath companions for the grandkids. they enjoy playing with these sassy toys in the tub at bathtime. highly recommended for all kids."
At first I was worried about the fact that they glow and wondering what is in them but we see no signs of any wear and tear on these after months. It's so great to be able to find them without turning on the light. Just hold them up to a light for like 5 sec and they will glow for the night.
"My daughter was born prematurely, and this was the first pacifier she was given in the hospital. I've tried others, but these are by far her preferred pacifiers. I like them because they are much easier to thoroughly clean than most others, with no little crevices to harbor dirt or germs. I also feel safer with the one piece design, with peace of mind that these cannot come apart or break. Doubt that would happen with other pacifiers, but being a mom I naturally worry about everything with my daughter."
My baby only likes this pacifier.<br />I love the quality and color of this product. The only downside is that sometimes water or baby's saliva gets in them and there is no way to clean this since you cannot take it apart.<br />It was shipped and arrived in time.
I had seen a baby with this pacifier and thought it was cute.  I purchased it for my grandchild.  It is real cute and her mom had wanted it without my knowing it.
Bear was adorable and my 3 week old grand daughter was very interested in it . Seem to give her comfort. I would tell all mothers to purchase one for their baby.  Love that bear .
My son and I both love this paci.  Its so cute plus its easy to find.  I would get all of them if I could
My kiddo was supa' cute! This product is worth it for the laughs. He has enjoyed playing with it beyond Halloween as well.

"I bought these for a friend whose baby was in the NICU. These are the pacifiers we give the babies in our NICU where I work. The babies love them! I don't know if it's the light sweet smell they have or there fun shape, but those babies quiet right down :)"
started using this kind of pacifier after the hospital gave us one. baby gives it 2 thumbs up. still using this (not 3 months + one) at 5 months. will replace at first sign of wear.
"Bought this for my nephew.  He loves it!  Really helps them control the pacifier, less spiting out onto the floor."
"I had mixed feelings about using a pacifier, but when my baby refused to latch and we were forced to feed him breastmilk from a bottle, he needed some more sucking to soothe himself.  The hospital have us one of these, and we've used them since.  Easy to clean as well.  Buy lots! They tend to disappear around the house!"
"This is a brilliant invention. My twins like smoothie pacifiers anywa, and this helps the keep it in their mouths. The only drawback is its hard to clean and sterilize, but well worth it anyway."
"this is a brilliant invention. my twins like smoothie pacifiers anywa, and this helps the keep it in their mouths. the only drawback is its hard to clean and sterilize, but well worth it anyway."
"my son is 2 months old and i only use this pump about twice a week to store milk for when i'm away from him, or for the convenience to feed him from a bottle while im out & about. so far it's worked great for me. when my breasts are full i am able to pump about 4 ounces from each breast in 10 min or less...for now this is all i need but i will definitely look into buying an electric one if i ever need to pump more to save time."
i got this for my son when he was a year old.  he's 2 1/2 and still loves it.  i've bought it for other's for gifts too.  it's a good one.
"we do use grovia diapers and i bought these wipes thinking i might try cloth wipes.  as it turned out i've been very happy using cloth diapers for over a year, but never used cloth wipes.  i do however still love these wipes.  with a newborn they are irreplaceable.  a burping cloth was just too big and not very soft for the constant clean up of their cute face; these wipes were just the right size and amazingly soft.  i always had one in my pocket, and at least one more in arms reach.  we actually found that we almost never used burping clothes and bought a second pack of these instead.  now that our baby is a toddler we use them for blowing her nose because they are again so much softer then a tissue. - i would recommend these to anyone with a newborn for a variety of uses; they were a staple for us."
"loving this crib pad. waterproof, fits great, and nice quality. looks like some reviewers shrunk their covers... i'd recommend washing on cold and drying on delicate, low heat to avoid this."
"this light blue one looks like a scarf on my daughter.  navy and red look like western bandanas (so cute!).  absorbs like a dream.  well made.  wish all our bibs were these...we would only need 3 per day instead of 6 of the cheapos.  i have 7 in different colors and use 1 per day.  i save it for when we go out so that she still looks cute and her outfit isn't ruined by an ugly/huge bib.  if only i could afford 21 of these!  (had to buy some colors directly from silly billy's website, but shipping is cheap there.) love"
i really love this car seat! my daughter was very uncomfortable in her graco 35 maybe because the straps had gotten too tight. but this seat was very easy to install in the rear facing position. it is somewhat hard to loosen the straps at first until you get used to them. very comfy fabric
"this blanket is as soft and cute as it looks!  my little boy drags it around everywhere it goes, and it still looks brand new after a few washes."
we love this clock!  we had issues with my son waking us up at 6 am even on saturday's until we got this clock.  he now stays in his room till his little friend turns green!  i would recommend it to anyone that has a child that is an early riser like ours.
i purchased a dr.seuss outfit for babys first birthday as his party theme. was dr.seuss.he weighs 25 lbs so i took 24 months.he had a little bit room.he looked adorable.i purchased on amazon. very pleased.
"this is a lightweight diaper cover.  i have not had any leaks, but let me tell you how i stuff them which may be the key.  i use the gerber prefolds which tend to be a but long and bulky in the center.  i fold the excess in the front since my baby tends to wee upword (if you are not sure where the excess is use a disposable and check to see where the concentration of urine is-this will help you not to have leaks and better help you stuff your diapers to meet your needs/also how she is laid to sleep).  please be advised that i use many different types of diapers and different stuffing to meet the need. that has led to much success."
"i got this for my cousins baby shower, also matching bibs and burp cloths. it was very soft and cuddly, perfect for a newborn, everybody at the shower loved it. much cuter than any pastel walmart or target blanket :)"
"very happy with waterproof liner, since it lies very flat, unlike other liners i've used. i've subsequently ordered 3 more liners!"
"great car seat!!! exactly what we were looking for great quality, easy use!!! would highly recommend this carrier.  love graco products!"
"we initially bought another rail which had a disc that you affix to the mattress. upon discovering how flimsy the attachment was, we returned it and purchased the dex rail. what a huge difference! the dex rail attaches to the spring frame of the crib, not the mattress. yes, it took a little more work to assemble, but it was well worth it. i feel much more confident placing my child his converted crib now. thanks dex!"
"we ordered this for our daughter's nursery. it was delivered very quickly, in great condition. it did take a while to put together but it was not difficult."
great for toddlers learning to eat with spoon and fork-- the forks w plastic prongs are too hard for kids to grab the food.  the lip on the plate helps them scoop food up. highly recommend.
this item is great.  i am glad that i purchased it.  my son is just coming up to 12 months and already eats on his own.  this spoon allows him to eat properly and the food goes straight into his mouth.  i would definitely recommend this item.
"love this product!  great height for my son at 18 months and still at 2.5 years.  great non-slip surface and loves to use it all around the house.  i would recommend this to anyone!<br />great product, great price!"
really happy. these are so cute and will be great with the tutu i purchased.nice material.i think they will hold up well.
"We purchased these in preparation for our new baby.  They started holding baby and diaper supplies for us to use and now a year and a half later have turned into toy bins for her.  We were able to re-purpose some of our existing furniture to make it more kid friendly.  We've used a combination of these bins on bottom shelves full of toys and the smaller bins on the above shelves with smaller toys and books.  I have also found them handy on a self near our front door for all those extra things you need quickly as you're running out the door with someone in your arms.  We now have 6 larger, 4 small, and 2 matching hampers used through out the house; and in the brown they match both in her room and in the public areas of the house.<br /><br />We also move every couple years and once the bins are emptied into moving boxes the bins themselves are inconvenient to pack and we have broken numerous different types over the years.  I look forward to our next move with these, and being able to collapse them all and put them in a moving box as well.<br /><br />--  Simple but great product, the uses for them are endless; and so good so far holding up to a toddlers use."
"Prevents paci from rolling into the land of nowhere. Saved my sanity when my babies were about 6months old.  Now that they are almost 1, they love the little animal.  My son will not use an ordinary paci to go to sleep. Had to buy some back ups!"

"This pacifier pouch does the job very well. It easily snaps onto my diaper bag handle and I never had any problem with it getting detached or anything. I like that it has a simple, velcro flap closure instead of zipper closure on a round case as many other pacifier pouches have, so it's very easy to get the pacifier out. I usually have my baby in one arm when I want to take it out, so velcro makes it easier for a quick, one-handed opening. I usually keep one NUK pacifier with a Booginhead Paci Grip attached to it, and it's a perfect fit. I have taken 2 pacifiers and it was kind of tight, but if you don't have the strap, 2 pacifiers would fit pretty well too. The outside fabric is wipable so it's easy to clean if anything gets spilled on it or something."
"I decided before my baby was born that I was going to use the soothies, so I stocked up. I just kept being told that they were the only ones that their babies would take! But a friend of mine bought me a pack of MAM pacifiers and my baby loves, loves them! The shape of the nipple is great, and the sterilizing box is awesome. I've only ordered some from Amazon once, and luckily I got blue ones for my son. I've also bought some from Target, who carries all different sizes. I gave some to another friend with a newborn and now her baby girl is hooked too! Such a great product with such cute designs."
"[[ASIN:B004IY6AGW Mary Meyer Ella Bella Elephant Wubbanub]]<br /><br />I LOVE WUBBANUB'S! What more could I say? This is my second Wubbanub purchase.I ordered one for DBG before she was born with hopes that she would take to it and she did!We have used our first one which was a small pink monkey now for nearly three months and it has been through a lot and still holding up.I wanted to have another as a back up.I ordered the ELLA BELLA Wubbanub because it was just too cute.We finally got it and I am very pleased with it.It is super soft and super cute.It is a good size not too small and not too big...just right and it's not heavy at all,just enough weight to it to help it stay where you want it to.I washed it and tried to give it to DBG and she would have nothing to do with it :( to my suprise.I decided to let her sleep with it for a few days along with her monkey Wubbanub and it worked! I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)"
Convenient and cute. It is nice to have on the carrier.  It matches the diaper bag well too.  I love it.
My grandbaby loves his God Bless Lamb. Kuddles it all the time. The pacifier is just the right size for a 1 to 2 month old and up.
These pacifiers are awesome.  I love that they glow in the dark so I can see them in the middle of the night if baby wakes up after spitting it out.  I just wish I could've found them in the smaller size when I first introduced the pacifier to my baby.
"My son tried 6 different pacifier brands and this was the only one he would use. I've purchased close to 100 of them in the last year, since we lose them like crazy. Sigh. Anyway, when he needs a pacifier, it's desperate, so we have them all over the house now. I like that these are mostly clear, so we can still see his happy little smirk through the pacifier. And they aren't too distracting in photos, etc. They come in a variety of colors, and we have just about every one of them. I would definitely recommend them, however, it's really up to your baby and their preference. The pricing on Amazon is pretty consistent with Target pricing."
My granddaughter absolutely LOVES her wubbanub.  And it helps us keep track of her pacy.  We absolutely LOVE THIS ITEM!
My daughter started using these around 3 months and wont move up! She loves these binkys and these only! Easy to clean and holds up well
"My grandbabies love this pacifer, the toy that is attached to it is easy for them to hold and find.  It is easy to wash, I put it in the dishwasher when needed and it comes out good as new.  Better yet it is easy to find and easy to notice when it is dropped."
"We purchased this once we removed the breathable bumper (when my daughter started using it to try and climb out, lol). When all the other binkys fall out, this one stays in. Saves me from a midnight trip to give her a binky!"
My son loves this pacifier and its perfect for church! It is very soft and easy for him to keep in his mouth- not to mention its easy for me to keep up with!
I purchased 2 pacifiers 'Just Chillin' and 'Pull to sound alarm'. The mommy to be absolutely loved it and burst out laughing along with the guests. It was a hit. The picture doesn't do it justice. It looks very durable and very well made. I was very pleased and I highly recommend for all those with a sense of humor.
"My husband and I received these pacifiers in orange while in the hospital after the birth of our daughter.  We had, as new parents, gone out an bought what we thought were great pacifiers (Tommee Tippee).  We quickly learned that what you think you will like vs. what you actually use is sometimes quite different.  I'm not sure if it was because she was born small, (roughly 5.5 lbs,) or because she just likes the feel, but our daughter refuses the TT pacis and instead prefers these alone. The nipple is more similar to a breast, and to a baby who is exclusively breastfed, I would imagine that it is more soothing. We ended up buying more of the Hawaii Medical Gumdrops because they are awesome.  They have a great one-piece design and a little handle that allows you to manipulate the pacifier in you little one's mouth.  I would highly recommend these to any parent."
"I watch childern in my home. After someone telling me about these when my 3 yr old was born- it had been her best friend since. It is so nice to have for them to be able to hold and find easily when slips out of their mouths. This is the ONLY binki she never lost!!! Was so nice to have on trips, and was such a comfort to our child. When I started watching 2 new borns, I bought one for each of them. One mom loved it so much she bought some for friends of hers that are getting ready to have babies! :)"
When the product was recieved it was packaged well and all portions of packaging was intact. The product seems to be of great quality and is durable. I intend to buy another variety of billy bob baby pacifiers in the future as my daughter loves hers! Thanks for the awesome product and quick shipping as well!
"This was the only pacifier my son would take. But while sterilizing during a football game, my husband melted the only ones we had. This order came promptly and at a good price for 6 units."
These are our favorites. The gumdrops are cuter but my baby always seems to shift them around in his mouth. It's nice and easy that these are round. Every baby is different but these ones work great for us.
"My little guy LOVES this!  It serves as both his paci and lovey, so it is his go to item right now, and has been for about 4 months (he's 9 months now). The monkey's feet are the perfect size for little hands to grasp, and the whole thing is machine washable. My son also chews on the monkey's tail to soothe his sensitive gums when his teeth are coming through.  I received our first one as a gift, and purchased 2 more to have handy. I highly recommend this!"
This item was GREAT! it is awesome! GET THIS!! My experience was great! You're baby will love this! I very much enjoyed it because it was soft and squishy!
"Orange and Blue! Great product, very happy baby, durable, washes easily.<br />Chomp Chomp, bink, bink! It's great to be a Florida Gator...<br />GO GATORS!!!"
One of the greatest baby items we own! We have two of these and I am considering a third! Our lo loves it and We love that she can put it back in her mouth in her own! Just can't say enough about this wonderful product!
"We Love our wubbanubs, they are perfect! Very easy to keep up with and stylish! We always get compliments on how cute she looks holding them!"
"Love the item.  WubbaNub pacifiers are a sure hit for new borns.  They can quickly control it themselves and usually do not care for any other pacifier when they realize this.  The animal body is always soft and cuddly--a plus for baby and mom.  And just throw it in the washing machine or dishwasher when needed.  BabyHaven prices were reasonable and they shipped this immediately.  Makes for easy, quick and appreciated gift for any new baby."
"My baby loves her wubanub!  The little pink bear helps keep the pacifier in place, and she can hold on to it, even though she's only 2 months old.  Also makes for cute photos."
"My 4.5 month old has started waking up all through the night looking for her paci.  She is just barely coordinated to get her paci back in about 1/3 of the time (that I see, although she probably finds it sometimes and I don't even know).  Since she has figured out how to roll over, she only sleeps on her belly.  Mam pacifiers are great for belly sleepers because they have a low profile and don't get knocked out of baby's mouth when she turns her head, and they are super light so they stay in easily.  I have sprinkled like 6 pacis around her head at night to increase the odds that she'll find one.  Until now, she had been using the under six month size, but I wanted to get the 6+ size to see what the difference is.  The shield is a bit larger and so is the nipple, and the nipple is more bulbous at the end.  I haven't noticed that she has an easier or harder time keeping them in than the smaller size.  She seems to not care which size I give her.  The glowing is genius.  Only the knob glows, not the shield or nipple, so the glowing part doesn't touch her face.  Makes it a snap for me to find in the night, and I'm hopeful that it helps her find them more often, too!  I held them under the light for like 10 seconds before I put her down, and they were much dimmer but still glowing 12 hours later."
I love this little monkey! The passy atually come with it and it is permantly attached! my son lov monkeys they are his favorite!!!
"My son and daughter-in-law love pirate things.  They decorated the room for the baby boy they were expecting in a pirate theme and we had a pirate baby shower for her (Ahoy, It's a Boy).  I bought this pacifier as one of the many things to fill the whale baby bath tub.  It was a big hit at the shower!"
"We live in San Diego, California and are huge Denver Broncos fans. All we could find around here in local stores is Chargers gear for our baby. (Boo) So being able to find it on here for the price is great! Happy with the product. Can't wait til our little one is here to use it!"
"Buying a pacifier is always hit or miss. Kids are fussy. Thankfully my niece loved this one and it was adorable! Unfortunately the dog got a hold of it, so I had to buy another, but it was worth it! The product came with a cover and didn't break, so I'd recommend it!"
"I bought this for my 2 month old daughter.  She didn't get it until just shy of 3 months, and now hugs it, and can therefore hold it in her mouth.  I think they are adorable in come in so many cute animals.  I love it!"
I like this pacifier holder because its large enough to fit 2-3 pacifiers in it and it's great that it can be attached to the outside of the diaper bag for convenience. I really love the Mixed Leaf design as well. I purchased many JJ Cole items for my new baby and I really like all the items I have. They are high quality and very attractive designs!
As a newborn he could only use a Soothie preemie paci because his mouth was small even though he was full term. By 4 & 1/2 months he needed to move to a newborn size so we decided to try a Wubbanub. He adores his monkey Wubba and it fits him way better now that he is a bigger guy. :) And best of all it is easy to find and doesn't bounce and roll when he drops it :)
I use for bottle nipples as well perfect for a diaper bag. Safer than using baby wipes. Great product and price
Very good and cute soothie. My son picked up on this immediately and easy/soft for him to hold on to it.
Received the package VERY fast and I am really pleased with the paci tho so for a diaper cake I am making :)
There's a nice smooth cool side for hot days and a soft fleece side for warmer days. Nicely sized for hugging (not to cover baby) and teething corners make this blankey a recommend!
He loves this .he holds on to it can not go without it and he is 3 weeks old .if you have a baby or grandchild I recommend  you get as many as you can of these.
"I got this for my 3 month  old and he seems to LOVE it! He gets excited and  gurgles when he sees it coming toward him. I like that it gives him something to clutch and feel while sucking on the paci. I have read that at this age, babies like textures. I am going to order some more so that he always has one to play with wile the other is being washed. That said, others have complained about the paci not being able to separate from the plush part, I just fill a bowl with hot water and Meyers laundry detergent (just a dash) and let it soak for 10 minutes,rinse, squeeze it out and line dry it."
I love these! I have used them for my baby since he was about a month old. He is almost 5 months old now. They seem to work great! I love the size. I tried a few other brands and my baby just would not take them. They were all too long or the shape was one he didn't like. These seem to be the shape and length that he likes. I actually bought a ton of these because the baby kept dropping them everywhere. I seriously will not buy any other kind. They don't have these in the store so I have to purchase them on Amazon and just wait for them to be shipped. I will be using these for my next babies for sure.
This pacifier is light and shaped right.Soft and consists of whole thing not different parts. Our son's favorite pacifier.It lets him breath as it has a space for nose.
I love that these pacifiers are all one piece. My baby doesn't take a pacifier too often but when he does hes able to keep it in. He also really loves to just chew on it and I don't have to worry about him hurting himself. Compared to other pacifiers where the plastic is harder. He seems to really enjoy them.
"I highly recommend this product to anyone who is or is planning on using nooks for babies. It easily snaps on and off so I have this one hooked onto the diaper bag and another onto my purse. This allows you to now have to dig through pockets or the bottom of bags to try and find the nook. It's right there and easy to grab, especially when you need to ask and older child to bring one to you. It also keeps the pacifiers clean. It can easily fit 2 or 3 in there at a time. The colors are accurate too."
"I ordered this Wubbanub pacifier for our daughter who is due in a few weeks. I was excited about it, because it is so much different than the ones they sell in stores. It seems like around where I live they only sell pacifiers that look little boy-ish (Green Frog and Red Dog). So when I saw this I knew our daughter needed it! When it arrived I was so pleased. It is so much cuter in person than the picture (and I thought it was adorable in the picture). I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to others with/expecting a little girl."
our delivery nurse gave us and recommended these pacifiers and i ordered these so my daughter always had a new one and they are exactly like the ones provided at hospital. with added design!
"Out of all of the pacifiers that we have tried, this is the only one that works. The pricing also makes this one the best bang for your buck. This pacifier has been very helpful in soothing our newborn. It has saved us from many a sleepless night. If he's not hungry, all we have to do is pop it right back in his mouth and he soothes himself to sleep at night. We have ordered this pacifier over and over and will continue to do so for the next month."
The wubanub is great! Its light enough to remain on baby's chest so that you don't lose it. Baby can grab this a bit easier than just a pacifier alone. Her Ellie is her favorite paci & toy! Definitely recommend it to any parent!
"Shipping was very fast for this product. I am expecting so I didn't get to use this yet for the baby, but I did get it out of the package and there was not 1 thing wrong with it. It was perfect!"
We placed our order on saturday and we received it on tuesday! Very quick shipping and wonderful product. It is almost exactly like the picture except the zebra stripes are grey instead of black. But it is still just as cute!
Love this cow! So cute. My daughter loves it. Very soft and easy to find when my daughter drops it out of her mouth. Would recommend any of the WabbaNub line to everyone.
Dr. Brown's pacifiers are the best for our baby(three months old).<br />She prefers them hands down over other brands I have tried.<br />They work and the quality of the product is great.
Adorable sheep! I bought this for my friend for her birthday and she loved it. Soft and cuddly and a nice small size.
"This is very cute, and it comes with a cover for the nipple part. I am taking it to a baby shower, and will probably get lots of comments on it. I'm very excited!"
I bought this with the princess paci clip as part a a twin cess baby gift..they better in person. Since this is a gift for twin I bought 2 extra in case they loose one... I only saw these one other place on the Internet so  they make a unique gift
It's a good buy to get your infant started off in the right direction. I've had no problems with it and neither has my son
"This item is great for my 2 month old and she loves it. Since she has really chubby cheeks, the other pacifiers that are more rounded tend to make a red mark on her cheeks. This item, however, does not have the rounded wings on it and it's a great item for her. I recommend this item to all chubby cheeked babies."
Baby boy loves the Soothie pacifier.  The plush toy makes it easy to prop up on the baby so the pacifier stays in place.  Also helps me keep it from hitting the ground when moving him around.
I got these for a very good friend who is expecting twins. She is a huge fan like myself and it was a huge hit at the baby shower.
"I got this wet bag to throw in the diaper bag for cloth diapers when we are out. It's super cute, and keeps the stink out! It came with a pacifier bag too! Very convienent. Great price too! Love it. I would purchase again."
"This is my absolute favorite baby product.  This pacifier is amazing.  When my son was a small infant his pacifier would constantly fall out meaning he would wake up and want it back, but being a infant he could not find it.  However with this product, if the pacifier fell out of his mouth it would still be lying on him and he would be able to find it again to sooth him back to sleep.  Not only that, but when he was so young he could start holding it and directing it back into his mouth or pick it up.  Now that he is just over one, it is his lovey, he likes to have it with him when he is ready for a nap or needs comfort.  When he is too old for the pacifier part, I plan to just snip off the pacifier and he will have his little friend he will have a much easier time letting go.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention it is adorable!"
This has been a life saver and is super cute at the same time! No more searching for pacifiers in the middle of the night. I recommended purchasing 2 of them. I use 2 in the crib and there's never an issue at night with trying to find a pacifier. Which means more sleep for me! This is all my little one uses!
"These are seriously the best pacifiers I have ever seen !!<br /><br />The pacifier part is the same as soothe pacifier but with a elephant hanging off. The small animal attached to it makes it incredibly easy to find compared to a regular small circular pacifier, which is easily hidden under beds, throughout toys, and behind the couch!<br /><br />For my daughter her Wubbanubs are soothing and relaxing and help her sleep, she couldn't live without them!  She has used them since birth and still does at 2 years old!<br /><br />The dentist recently told us we made a good choice in pacifiers, even though he discourages the use of ANY pacifier!  Her teeth are perfect and I credit that to these pacifiers!<br /><br />5 stars and the best of the best !"
"My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free."
"couldn't live without them and love that i can wash them too!  when my son lost his, we were using baggies like crazy.  i feel like i'm doing something good for the earth and they are convenient too."
"bag is not overly huge but not to small either. had no roblems with it.very comfortable to wear. of course this bag isn't made to please everyone i will say it can withstand some tugging, pulling and plenty of spills. easy to clean. and since i bought it for my wife she thought it was perfect. it suited our needs and most of the time i wear. and as you can see it's quite fashionable lol. i have no problem wearing this. but now if it was pink and flowery.... ehhhh idk. but overall it's a great product. if your a dad and you know you'll be having it with you most of the time, look no further."
"a very useful device to keep my eyes on my 80 yr old father who is mobility challanged. this monitor not only works for babies, but is a great tool for the elderly! he's a bit frustrated on the lack of privacy... but i convinced him that his safety was our primary concern and he can cover the camera lens anytime he wants. he doesn't like it, but i love it!"
"i have 2 year old twins and we are still using these cribs. i have loved them the entire time. they set up easily. love that the instructions are on the bottom platform so you can't lose them. we have gone through the chewing stage, there is bite marks but you can only see them when your up close. we are expecting our 3rd baby. i'm do happy that this crib is still available. i will be buying another one. i love that it will grow with our children and we only have to buy them one bed. they are beautiful cribs!"
"i just bought another one of these for a gift, because i think it's so great!  i originally purchased for my baby at 6 months old and i wished i would have had it sooner.  there were times where baby would be crying or coughing and suddenly stop.  was she ok?  i didn't know without pulling over until i got this mirror.  now a quick check in my rear view mirror and i can see how/what she's doing (and sometimes she is doing the cutest things in her car seat :).  also, with the recommendations to leave babies rear-facing until age 2, it's extra nice to have this.  my daughter loves this too -she'll make faces or smile at herself in the mirror.  also, this mirror is not gaudy looking - it looks nice a subtle in any car interior.  i would highly recommend."
"the first thing i noticed was how soft it all was, right out of the packaging. i rarely write reviews but had to make sure to write one about this set. it was very soft, and i love the fact the top flat sheet has bottom edging so it doesn't just get kicked off by the little ones. almost like a half-fitted sheet, very nice. any kid that loves sesame street or elmo will love this set, my little man loves elmo and i love the fact one side of the pillow cover has a big picture of elmo (the other side is cookie monster) it is not all elmo though, so if you are looking for just him it's not for you. but there is sufficient elmo that my little guy loves it. :)"
"i haven't given this to my daughter yet because it is for her 5th birthday next month but i tried it out. it casts so many stars onto the ceiling. it actually surprised me that it covered the whole ceiling of my bedroom (my bedroom is pretty big). i guess i just imagined it would project enough to cover a small section of the ceiling. my 2 year old son was in the room when i tested it out and he was amazed by all the stars as well. he was mad when i had to put it away. guess he's getting a turtle version of this for christmas. the ladybug is also adorable. i saw that some of the customer pictures featured one with closed eyes but in the main picture her eyes were open. mine arrived with her eyes open and i was pretty pleased about that. i think she's cuter that way. anyway, i think my daughter is going to love it. if not, i'm giving it to my son. :)"
"easy to install, looks cute, and serves it's purpose.  also keeps my daughter's legs from getting stuck in between the crib slats."
the toy exceeds my expectation.<br />my son enjoyed kicking at it.<br />both my wife and i think it is well worth the money if the kids love it.
"The Munchkin website only illustrates this quick install gate for doors, but I bought it as a solution for a window and it works great.  The honeycomb plastic lets air pass thru and keeps toddlers from pushing against the window screen and falling out.  I can tell you that this is very secure if installed on the interior window jam.  My window still is able to slide up and down without interference from the gate.  It can also be removed in seconds if needed to use the window as a fire escape.  The seller on my gate was shipped and sold by Amazon LLC, and shipping was very quick."
I bought two of these pacifiers for a friend's Baby Shower. She LOVED them! I think one might be used on the husband... O_o<br /><br />The items arrived swiftly after purchasing them.<br /><br />GREAT quality!
such a great idea to have these glow in the dark i wish more companies did this with there pacifiers
"I bought this for my little one, she loves the 0-3 Soothie so I figured she would like these once she got a bit older. They are same size as the 0-3 green one, they are just a bit more stiff for the older mouth. I would definitely recommend this pacifier."
"My wife bought this for our new baby about 2 months ago. She has used it every day since. She loves the soothie brand pacifier and she loves this one a lot. Baby likes to grab the plush body while sucking on the pacifier. Great product, would definitely recommend."
these are great. my newborn can keep this paci in his mouth better than soothies. the nipple is the same shape as the soothie which was important since i'm nursing. we have had zero nipple confusion. our lactation consultant also recommended using a paci (soothies or gumdrops only to prevent confusion) saying they've actually been recommended to prevent sids...SOLD.
"I received my first wubbanub at a baby shower, and I am so glad that I did!  It has been a life saver because like the other reviews say, it stays in place very well on my son's chest.  The only negative comment I can make is that the area where the paci is sewn to the doggie mouth has begun to rip and is almost completely separated.  It is beyond repair, but it is worth the $15 to replace.  You will be satisfied with this product."
"This a great product for baby. It was shipped fast and reasonably priced well. Baby just loved this item. Thanks, Amy"
My son loves this and holds the giraffe too! Ordered a bear too ! Easy to wash with mesh bag in machine.
"We've always used AVENT brand pacifiers and our daughter has never had a problem with them. We boil them for 2-3 minutes before giving them to her, and put them in the dishwasher regularly. They clean very well, and they are durable. The only thing is that when we hand wash them with dish soap, the soapy water gets into the inside of the nipple from the handle part, like the picture part of the binky. So we have to hold the pacifier nipple-side-up and squeeze the nipple for the water to come out. Otherwise we love these pacifiers."
These are absolutely adorable and useful. They are bigger so they keep the pacifier in babies mouth and also are good for baby to hold. I love these.
"my daughter is a pacifier junkie, and while it would be nice to start weaning her off of them, i value my sleep at night, so i got these to replace lost ones and seems to satisfy her fine."
"After trying numerous other brands, this is the only one my dd would use. They are also cute & come with a carrying case."
"great pacifiers for babies.  it gives them something to hold while on the pacifier and after weaning our kids off the pacifier, we cut off the pacifier part and they had little stuffed animals to sleep with.<br />we purchased a total of 5 for both our children, and is our go to gift for our friends with newborns."
"My children are long grown!  I haven't shopped much in the baby field since I don't have grandchildren but this is the cutest item I have seen in a long time.  I love the covers that are on pacifiers now, how smart.  bj"
"This product makes sanitizing pacifiers so easy and quick! I don't use bottles so I didn't need a big sanitizer, this is small so it doesn't take up much space at all. I wish I had found it sooner."
"If you are a Hello Kitty fan, these are a must for your little princess!  They are exactly like the regular NUK pacifier 6-18 months, just adorned with awesome HK"
"The expected mom loved it. It got here fast.<br />Would buy again. Other people asked me where I got it.<br />Though I think you have to wait till baby gets older, not for new born.<br />You should buy it if you want a unique gift. That's why I bought it. My friend was saying at the baby shower she got lots of new born clothes and the baby would never be able to use them all."
We all love this! Daughter likes to hold monkey's paw even when not using the soothie.  Friends and family think its such a cute idea.  I was little worried about price but she enjoys it so much! The monkey is well constructed and so soft.
This was a great gift for my grandson.  He loves these little pacifiers.  At 4 weeks he can push them into his mouth!
Great idea to make mom and others laugh and a plus for the baby. Why? Because he will recieve more attention of course!
"you could buy the same gate for pets at a chain pet store at 3 time the cost... works the same, looks the same, so cheaper is always better! very happy with my purchase."
"i bought this chair when my grandchild was born and used it for our second. it's portablility makes it a breeze to bring to a restaurant, as well as use for the home and it takes up very little space when folded. my experience is that it has been sturdy and i appreciated it being adjustable to different thicknesses of tables. this is the third one bought, two others were gifts and very much used and appreciated. i highly recommend this."
"i purchased this for my nephew.  before gifting it, i wanted to listen to the songs to know what he would hear.  i liked them and thought it was great.  he is now seven months old and i just saw a picture the other day with him holding it in his hand.  i think the music is stimulating while the beads offer moving parts for even more interest.  he looked like he was enjoying it very much!"
"we bought a more expensive tub first and returned it, after which my mom bought us this one. needless to say, it was perfect. we used it when our baby was tiny with the little butt bumper in, and now that he's almost eight months old we use it without the bumper and he just sits up in it (i lay him down to rinse his hair). we'll use it for as long as he fits! the little orange cup is one of his favorite toys, and the price is excellent too."
"for the inconsolable baby, especially during the middle of the night, this item just might do the trick.  if they never get used, that's ok too."
i purchased this gate for my boston terrier.  it works great because there is nothing for him to put his back legs on to climb out like the other gates.
it' is so beatiful and good quality. my first baby like this bumper(she have good sleep). i recommend this item. thank you.
"we've had this highchair/booster for about a year now and absolutely love it.  it's really sturdy and stays put in the chair.  the tray is a bit of a pain to snap on and off, but if you snap off just one side and then lift that straight up it comes right off.  it folds quick and easy, though really doesn't get small (basically the back rest folds over), but it's better than nothing!"
daughter loves the variety and the high contrast. the ball is just the right size for her little hands. i likes that items are different developmental levels such as the book and the rattle.
"this is such a great way to decorate a child's room without the hassle of painting. knowing my daughters taste will change over the years, this is a convenient way of decorating and then changing the design when needed."
"i have the older version of this swing for my 1st boyy, who is now 5 years old. i used it for my 2nd and now for my 3rd child! i must say it is very durable, i brought the swing along with me to overseas, and several cities in my luggage ( taking apart and utting them back together, by myself with a small screw, which takes only a few mnutes!!!).  i bought 3 others as gifts. my 2.5 years old still wants to sleep in this, then i transfer him to his bed. such a life saver."
my daughter hates it. she can't get past it. now we have peace of mind knowing that she won't get under our feet in the kitchen. great should have bought it sooner.
i purchased the ergo options carrier just so i could have the option to change the covers. this set is really cute and i can't wait to use it!
"i purchased this item for my best friend. its perfect for someone seeking an smaller alternative to a crib, because it looks and acts as one. the shipment came exactly on time, i loved the whole process and the bassinet. great purchase!"
this purchase arrived quickly and in perfect condition. it is easy to assemble and adjusts to fit different tables. te children enjoy sitting up to the table to enjoy their meal with the family.<br />excellent investment!
"i bought this pad to protect our bedding from all the spit up, diaper leaks, and you name it that comes from a baby. after reading the many reviews about the product material pilling, i was a bit concerned but decided to buy it and see for myself. i ended up buying 3 continental quilting waterproof pads to have around the house and also for back up so i'd always have a clean one if the others got dirty. boy am i happy with this product! it is perfectly sized, not too big, not too small, and completely waterproof as advertised. i've sent mine through the wash plenty of times and i'm happy to report that not a single one has had any pilling to speak of, considering that i have 3 of them i don't think it's luck of the draw that all three have not had any pilling. the fabric is not very soft however i just put a thin blanket over the pad so that my daughter is only in direct contact with the blanket covering the pad. love this pad!"
"this chair is amazing! we started using this for our son when he was about 6 months old. it is useful for many reasons:<br />1. your baby can sit at your level with you when you eat.<br />2. the chair cradles the baby (most high chairs for kids, especially when they are young, are way too big). we were not worried that he would fall back in the chair and we didn't have to support him with blankets like we usually do.<br />3. maybe most important - you don't have to worry about your baby hitting their face on the table (or using the table as a chew toy).<br />4. very portable to leave in the car and use when you go out to eat.<br />5. very good quality. extremely sturdy."
easy to assemble.  sturdy and well made.  i am going to put cushions on the top to double as extra seating in my office/craft room.  i bought two and love them.
mh daughter started teething hard core<br />at about 3 months. i purchased the giraffe teething toy and it was huge for her little mouth. fell across this one while searching and purchase it. absolutely amazing. she's almost 5 month and absolutely loves it still. there's always a place for her to chew on. it's easy to hold and clean. having dogs makes keeping things smelling good hard but the scent on this toy doesn't go away  awesome teething toy
"i've only used this on restaurant high chairs so far, but it's been great. my son is big for his age and started sitting up on his own at about 4.5 months, but we still thought he was too small to comfortably sit in a wooden high chair. a friend recommended this cart cover, so we got it and we love it! it's so soft and plush that he is very comfortable, and now he can sit at the restaurant table with us while we eat. (before, my husband and i would each have to take turns holding him and eating since he hated sitting in his car seat or a stroller at a restaurant.)<br /><br />before we bought this one, we checked out other, less expensive covers. we're happy we got this one because it has the following advantages:<br />1. it is very soft and plush (as i said before), so it pads the seat a bit for your little one.<br />2. it straps to the chair, and has its own little strap that holds the child in (it's like a little triangle-shaped piece of fabric that you put his feet through and straps around his waist, so it really keeps him in there! i've seen toddlers crawl out of restaurant high chairs and onto the table, so i think this feature would come in handy for children older than mine, too).<br />3. the tags! our baby loves them. we also use them as loops to attach links ([[asin:b001abzgu2 bright starts lots of links]]) and toys for our son.<br /><br />the main disadvantage to this cart cover is that it's kind of big. that's no big deal when we're taking it out in the car, but we like to walk places too. so, we purchased a 4l stuff sack ([[asin:b000sthhqi sea to summit ultra-sil stuff sack]], size s) for it, which makes it small enough to squeeze into the diaper bag when we're walking out for dinner. i'd recommend getting one if you're a walker too!<br /><br />we love our cart cover! i'm sure it will be great when we use it on an actual cart, too ;)"
i received this item fairly quickly and it was still in its original wrapping.  i am very positively impressed with this purchase.  highly recommend!  thank you:)
"this is one of the best 12 bucks i have ever spent in my life. my baby simply adores this toy. i never thought he will hang on to any toy for so long. it has been 4 months since i got this my baby is 7 months now and this is still his favorite. the designer of the toy has been so thoughtful of the colors, patterns, fabric material etc so well. my baby has got amused with every little thing dangling from the toy even today. he looks at it as if he is looking at it for the very first time. love it when i see my baby get amused."
"soft, beautiful, cozy and a great purple!<br /><br />bought as a gift for my baby-to-be!!<br /><br />i definitely recommend this as a great blanket for kids! they love the softness and the silky border!"
"i purchased this as a baby gift for my grandson and my daughter just loves it she does not have any negative comments at all. sure wish there was these products when i had my children.  the screen is very clear and the sound is great.  all in all a great product and would recommend it.[[asin:b004e9swq2 angelcare 4 piece baby video sound and movement baby monitor system ac1100, gray/white]]"
"i was worried about getting this vs. the more expensive cushee, but am glad i didn't fork out the extra money. this seat is very durable, doesn't tip over (no matter how weirdly my son climbs in), cleans easily and looks good too. highly recommended."
fits perfectly on our britax seat and it comes off so easy to clean. i would definitely recommend this product.
i bought this stroller as a happy medium between an umbrella stroller and a full size stroller and so far i am very happy with the purchase.  i was debating on this stroller and the city mini because they seem pretty comparable.  i decided on this one over the citi mini because it wad 50 cheaper and i liked that this one could work as a travel system if necessary.  we haven't used it for that function but have been using it for our 3 year old and also have a 6 month old who will also use it.  what i like most about this stroller is that it is still light weight like an umbrella stroller but it is so much more maneuverable.  this stroller pushes very easily and is great to take on walks and shopping.  overall i am very happy with the purchase.
"i have now purchased this gate three times!  once as a gift and twice for myself.  when we initially tried to install the gate, we couldn't get it to latch together.  we thought it was defective and needed to be returned.  that was not the case!  they actually have a paper that says there is a gap (i can't remember the reason) and they tell you how to fix it.  if we had read the paperwork carefully, we would have known this from the start.  unfortunately, we have not had to use the extensions so i cannot review the extension at this time.  also, i cannot review this product in terms of a toddler.  we are currently using it to keep pets out of bedrooms as we don't have doors on the hinges right now.  we have had no problems passing through these gates late at night without lights and i do imagine this will make an excellent gate whenever we eventually have children.  the height is very nice.  we had a wooden gate but our little yorkie was able to jump high enough to pull herself over the gate.  the wooden gate also had places where i felt she could get her little claws/paws caught, which is not the case with this gate.  we this gate daily and have had no problems with the latches or anything else!"
excellent product ...looks nicer when you recieve it than online! our granddaughter loves it!!<br />it is made of ceramic material and is easy to turn on.
"I was looking for a blanket that was soft and warm, yet not too warm. I also wanted one that was feminine with a classic look. That's exactly what I got when I received this blanket. It's perfect."
"My grandson, who is now 5 months old, cannot be far from his pacifier when he is tired...it calms him and off he goes to zzzzz!  This is a wonderful item....He has two other animals.....I love it because it is easily found....AND it is machine washable!  Now that he is a little older, he can put it in his mouth himself!  One caution!  The puppy I got was NOT brown, it was a gold color...but I didn't care!"
We have loved thr Momma Bear since my son was a baby & now we love giving it as a gift.  I'm glad Amazon has them!
This is the second one of these we have purchased and they are both great products. Would definitely recommend purchasing. They are nice because I don't know how many pacis we have lost but these are pretty hard to lose track of.
"We bought TONS of Nuk pacifiers for our baby and they were fine...until one day when I picked her up at daycare, the woman told me she had the best nap she had ever had there (slept for hours for the first time). Ok this might be gross and unhygienic but our daughter picked up another baby's paci and immediately calmed down and went to sleep (it was a Mam). what! that night I ordered these on Amazon and we will never ever use another brand of Paci. She loves them. I have no idea what it was...but these things are awesome. Right around when we got her these she started sleeping through the night (I can't directly contribute it to these but I can't discount it either). I'm a little bummed because I have a pile of literally 20 Nuks that I am just going to end up throwing away but sleep is worth it as you other mommies know :-)"
"I got these for my son when he was around two months. Prior to that I had used the smaller size in Mams (Mam Start). This is the only brand our son likes, when I would give him a different brand he would just spit it out. I love the cute designs, although it says colors may vary and we were sent pink, oh well! I also got the Mam pacifier clip."
This is one team my fiancee and I can agree on. We don't have a baby yet but wanted to make sure we got the deal on them now.
"my 7 month old boy loved this mattress. he was having difficulty getting comfortable enough to sleep through the night, waking up constantly. the graco play pen i bought him had a hard and thin mattress. i began to compare different items online by reading others reviews and came across the dream on me mattress. when i first placed the mattress down he was happy stomping his feet on it trying to walk around he liked the feeling of it on his feet. and by the miracle of god he fell asleep through the entire night and morning. it's soft but firm enough."
"this is a great changing pad.  it closes up to easily fit in a diaper bag or large purse , has room for wet wipes, diapers etc.  and can quickly and easily be wiped clean.  i highly recommend it and the color choices are terrific"
"i love this item.  my son is super tall and 2.  he outgrew halo sacks because they don't make them over an extra large and i hate the halo toddler sacks because they are fleece/polyester.  i love these sacks: great cotton material and comes in longer lengths. i also bought one for winter but haven't used it yet. you may be wondering why i put my toddler in a sack still.  well, i do it for thee reasons: he is used to it, it guarantees he is warm if he moves around and finally, he can't crawl or fall out of his crib. i highly recommend this item."
we bought one of these before for our 2 year old.  now he's three and he's got a one year old brother so we bought a three pack.  really good idea.
"super quick to ship! my son used it until he was 10 months old! he loved it! easy to clean, light weight and easy to move with one hand. have recommended to all our friends who are new parents."
love them. they work great and match our crib and crib set. great value for you money. definitely would recommend if you don't want bite marks on your crib.
"this teether is cute. it's not super soft, but sometimes my son prefers something harder to chew on while teething than a really squishy teether.  it's also fun becaus it doubles as a rattle."
"i'm so glad that i got this caddy to use as our main car seat stroller for my son for the first few months of his life.  originally i was thinking of buying a &#34;travel system&#34; (consisting of a full-size stroller, plus a car seat).. after testing them out i decided to get the caddy instead, and have been totally happy with my purchase.  here's what's so great about it: - it's super lightweight and portable - very easy to fold up and store in the car, then open up and pop baby in and out (without waking him, etc.) when running around town running errands. - handling is very good and it's actually pretty versatile, more versatile than you might think given how lightweight/portable it is.  it's definitely not an all-terrain stroller (the wheels aren't large or robust enough), but we took it on some walks on mostly flat dirt trails (nothing too bumpy/crazy), and it held up just fine. - storage basket is pretty darn generous for such a lightweight stroller.  it's no uppababy vista or anything, but it's plenty large for a diaper bag or groceries.  it's pretty easy to access too.  you may also be considering the snap n go generic caddy stroller, especially because it's so much cheaper than the chicco.  i struggled with the same thing, and am so glad that in the end i bought the chicco caddy made specifically for chicco carseats.  the chicco carseat audibly snaps into the chicco caddy and is much more securely attached than it would be on the snap n go (where there is no &#34;click,&#34; and you are supposed to manually close a strap over the carseat every time you attach it).  otherwise, i found the two stroller caddies to be pretty similar, in terms of ride/handling, quality/materials, etc.  but the greater security/safety & convenience (not having to use the strap) of the chicco caddy were good enough reasons for me to spring for it.  if you have a chicco keyfit car seat, and you plan to do a lot of in & out of the car, then i would definitely recommend that you get a caddy ... and this is the best one available for chicco carseats.  the only time i wouldn't recommend that you get a caddy is if you are primarily going to be strolling from home, and/or you really need an all-terrain stroller.  in those cases, by all means get a full-size stroller and just get an adapter so it can carry your keyfit.  but for most people, i think this would be a totally worthwhile purchase just for the added portability & convenience.  ------------  update aug 2016:  we kept this stroller around and just finished using it for kid #2.  she was tiny, so is still in her infant car seat at 15 months (!), so we have gotten a crapload of use out of this thing!  and it is still in great shape, totally functional.  the foam surrounding the handlebar is not as squishy as it was when we first bought it 4.5 years ago, but otherwise it's working as well as the day we bought it.  this really was a great buy for us."
"a must have for potty trainees.  we have extras, so we can easily swap out the piddlepad after an accident.  i've heard of parents using plastic bags, etc.  this is so much easier and very inexpensive. they run easily through the wash too and air dry in no time.  my daughter calls it her \\mat\\ and thinks she's special to have it.  i can't imagine she'd feel the same about a plastic bag. . ."
"these are basic bottles, at a cheap price.  they have a slow flow nipple that vent well, the nipples are actually different colors which i thought was really cute.  i bought 3 3packs and none have leaked yet.  i always buy the [[asin:b000mqsjqo nuby 2 pack soft sipper replacement spout, clear]] for transitioning to sippies to get my money out of the bottles i buy and these fit perfectly."
"it is a great product, my son loves it. he is able to relax in the shopping cart while i am buying all the things that i need."
"i love this walker, got it for my baby when she was about 6 months, she loved it and figured out over a month or so how to turn it around and everything. now she is almost a year and chases me around the house in it. the toy that is in the tray comes out and she enjoys it both in and out of the walker. it has held up really well and is pretty easy to clean. i recommend this to anyone looking for an easy to use walker with adjustable height."
we previously borrowed this stroller from a friend for a trip to chicago with two grandkids... it was fabulous for the airport and the zoo... plenty of space for the two of them with a little storage too.
my son loves sassy rings and at a great price u can't lose!! i had gotten bright starts rings and they were made cheaply and my son showed no interest
"i was totally pleased with my purchase, it came in a timely fashion, was exactly what i ordered and i thought it looked even better in real life then it had on the computer!"
"it's so soft and cute!! i'm very happy i went with this frog bed set!! looks just like the pic, love it!!! cant wait to set it up!!!"
"just got it and put it together, i love it!!! it's just like the picture but way cuter in person!!! it was easy to put together, can't wait for my son to use it!!! i know he'll love it when he's here ;)"
"one of the reviews complained about not being able to protect the pictures, but the pictures have been fine in mine and i have a 5.5 month old who puts everything in her mouth. anyway, pictures only cost like 10 cents to print, so i don't really care if one gets damaged every once in a while. it is a great way to help the baby be able to recognize her grandparents since she doesn't seem them as often as we'd like."
when i saw the theme precious planet flannel blankets i just had to order them.  i didn't expect them to be very high quality because of the price.  but to my surprise they were very well made and can't wait to use them in january 2013 when the grand baby arrives.
"this wet bag is super cute, and it seems to be doing its job well. i've only washed it a few times, so i can't speak to its durability."
"i use diapers to clean my house. they do not leave any lint behind and they are great for cleaning windows, mirrors. no streaks are left behind. they leave a great shine on my furniture, glass table tops, and my bathrooms. i was them first before using them when i first purchase them. i only use degtergent and bleach. no fabric softener. i rewash them after each use the same way. if you use fabric softener, they will not absorb. i just use luandry degtergent and bleach and wash them in hot water. they sure save on other cleaning cloths due to you can use these diapers over and over again until they are worn out. it takes years for them to wear out. it is worth the price and i am happy i was able to find more. where i usually purchase the cloth diapters, they do not sell them anymore. they are also great for waxing your vehicle. after you give your vehicle a wash, just take a clean diaper and wipe it down to dry it off and does not leave any scratches or streaks. best to use in the shade. same when waxing your vehicle. your vehicle will shine and sparkle and make it look brand new. no lint left behind or streaks."
"Great size! It will be plenty big enough for her inside shoes during the winter. Decent weight nylon, unlike some cheaper packs you can get at the general stores. Great buy and she loves it! Colors are true to picture too.The straps are navy, like the side pockets, with the trim and hanger in light blue like the piping."
We have 8 different Wubbanubs and they are great.  My daughter absolutely loves them.  The best thing about these paci's is my daughter can grab the stuffed animal part and put the paci back in her mouth in the middle of the night--saving my husband and I from having to get up and do it.  We can't live without Wubbanub!!!
Great quality! Great product! My grandson loves his new pacifier! I bought 6 or 7 differnet pacifiers and my grandson didn't like any of them until we found this one. He loves the large round center! I now have a happy baby boy!
My kid didn't love paci's but if we could get him to take one this was the only one he would take.  Seems like its lighter and easier for him to hold in his mouth?
"These things are great. We have had two previous ones (one for the diaper bag one for home)for a long time now and a round of bad luck hit us when we lost both of them just within a couple of weeks because my son threw them out of the stroller and I didn't notice :(. We ordered another right away because my son, now 11 months, loves holding on to the little animal. After losing our last wubbanubs I realized they were a security blanket for our kiddo. The other huge plus is that unless you have a baby like mine who likes to throw them out of the stroller they are so hard to lose, which is good!! These would also make fantastic gifts. I ordered our first one because I thought it was cute....little did I know how amazing they actually are."
"My coworker called these things baby crack and said that if your baby's given these pacifiers in the hospital, she's reject all others.  My coworker was right!  My baby absolutely loves these, and rejects all other pacifiers.<br /><br />I gave this 5 stars because, as the mother of a colicky baby, anything that calms her down is a godsend.  One thing I don't love about them is if you drop them, they both bounce and roll.  Doesn't sound like a big deal until youre crawling around on the floor at 3 am with a wailing baby in one arm, praying the thing didn't roll behind the couch."
I never loose this pacifier cause it's attached to an animal. The baby never loses it cause it's tucked into his shirt which also keeps it in his mouth. Great product. Already recommended to everyone!
"Our baby girl who is almost 3 months, is able to hold her pacifier in her mouth because the WubbaNub is big enough for her to grip on to. She has enough dexterity to hold the lamb with her hands, and she is so cute squeezing it as she falls asleep. We love the WubbaNub, it's her favorite pacifier by far. I totally recommend it for your babies."
"Great baby shower gifts!!<br />If you choose to use a pacifier this is a must have for infants! With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy/pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear... Well this is the closest thing to that without the odvious no-no's a headgear would bring ;-)"
i get laughs in church and at the store with this in my kids mouth. It is actually his favorite binky!
There really is no difference between these and any other pacifiers just the look.  But beings that my wife is a Packers fan it sure is fun having the Cowboys pacifiers around.
"We love these pacifiers. They are so much softer then the regular silicone pacifiers. Even if you don't get these for health reasons get them because they are much softer and gummier for the baby. We have used them since our boy was born. Even though he is breastfed, we did not have any issues with nipple confusion. He took the pacifier when he was not hungry. When he was hungry he didn't want it. They do have to be replaced once they become sticky. But for sanitary reasons it's best to replace any kind of pacifer after about 2-3 months."
"There are a few companies who make the Gumdrop pacifier and this one is the best. It is the most flexible, soft and lightweight. If your child cant keep the soothie in, get these! I used these until my daughter got the hang of her soothie."
"If I had seen this in a store I would have never bought it because at first I thought it was impratical. But after seeing such good reviews and seeing that the price wasnt steep I caved, and I'm so happy I did. Trust me when I say if your child likes the soothies they will ADORE this. My daughter doesnt even use the pacifier half the time and she loves the monkey. She has three of these (we had four but the dog ate one) and we keep one in the main areas of the house and one in the carseat. It is her little travel buddy, SO CUTE"
"I love these little guys! So cute, so easy to find, and pretty cheap. Just make sure your kid loves the soothie and your dog doesnt find it before you."
Bought this for my friends baby and had some good laughs! and it shut him up for a while too!
My daughter loves these pacis and now that shes teething she loves to chew them with my finger underneath. Cute colors and delivered on time. Would reccomend to anyone who has a child that is teething that was/is breastfed as they are more like Mom then other brands.
"I loves these but my daughter hated them she preferred her favorite paci...they r nice and very flexible don't have any hard plastic ,so if u have a wild sleeper they won't b hurt but these if they roll over it or hit it wit their face if it falls out!! :)"
These tethers are long enough to allow baby to play the attached toy but not too long to be dangerous.  Snaps securely on both ends.  I'm quite happy and would order again.
"These are the same as other nuk pacifiers except they have hello kitty on them! My granddaughter loves them.  I have sterilized them hand washed them several times already and the image is still perfect.  I was afraid it would rub off, but no worries."
This is a great pacifier. I purchased this right before the birth of my little girl and she has been using it since the first day she was born. Its easy to find if its dropped. She loves the softness and print of the giraffe. Its super easy to wash as it is machine washable. I recommend this to everyone. I've purchased another one for a friend since we love it so much. You won't regret it.
"i bought this, already have two others of two different brands.  i am really impressed with out strongly this one grips.  i will buy more of these."
"initially, i purchased one set to try and since they worked well i bought 8 more sets.  i was very impressed with these cabinet locks.  we do not have exterior handles on our cabinetry and wanted a concealed lock. i followed the instructions, used the templates and had no issues installing the locks.  my baby is just beginning to crawl and has not attempted any cabinet opening yet, but i have tested the doors and think they will hold up well.  i also like the ability to swivel the lock. even though i don't plan on disarming the locks it helped in the installation. i was able to swivel the hook when attaching it to the drawer/door and it made it much easier to get into tight corners."
"i loved this formula dispenser! you can't really tell from the picture that the side with the lid is funnel shaped, which makes it easier for the formula to flow out into the bottle. i nursed my daughter at first, so i only needed it for 6 months, but it held up well.<br /><br />why it's way better than sassy on the go formula dispenser: at first i bought the sassy on the go formula dispenser and hated it. there is no funnel under the lid, it's just flat, so some of the formula would go into the bottle, and the rest of it was stick inside the container. why bother premeasuring the exact amount you need if you can only get part of out of the container? go with the munchkin dispenser."
it helps my baby alot and he likes it so this is a good product to by and it will last a long time for u and your baby
"this booster seat is the best...no annoying straps that no one uses and just get in the way... soft and easy to stay on<br />and easy to stay in the chair where you place it.  love the orange color as it blends with my decor.  my grandson was<br />delighted when it arrived and we were able to remove the two phone books he had been sitting on.  (it arrived in a speedy<br />manner as well) i am more than delighted with this purchase....and his other grandmother upon hearing my praise, bought<br />one too...in black."
"love these bibs because they clean easy, wipe right off for several uses and then throw in the washer later. best of all, they're soft & fit snuggly around baby's neck to actually serve the purpose of a bib"
"this bag was perfect for what we needed.  we did not, in fact, notice that it was for gate check, and we checked it with our big suitcases at the ticket counter.  it stood up fine for 2 flights (or 4 flights, we had lay-overs), and also made for a convenient way to lug the car seat from the car to the airport.<br /><br />it was definitely worth the money.  it packs up very small and kept the car seat in good condition during the trips (we even stowed a baby ride-on toy in the bag with the car seat on the way home)."
perfect for what we needed. we are using it as a way to block off the litter box from our dog.
my wife and i have an ez-cling sun shade in each of our cars. it works wonderfully for such a simple little device.<br /><br />it clings instantly to the car window and is very easy to move and center.
i love this pump. it works great and i love the design of the shield and how it kinda massages the breast. its very easy and quick to clean.
"we ordered these at 5 months, and really regretted not getting them earlier. she loved playing with the legs of the ladybug and the antennae of the bee. our daughter is 12 months old and still loves these. she carries them around with her all over the place. i like that they're small, but too big to choke on. i highly recommend them."
"i love it!! it was so easy to put together i didnt even need the manual!! i wouldnt want any other pack n play other than my graco pack n playard with newborn napper! i love the color too, it's great for a boy or girl :) they also shipped it to me within 2 days. i couldnt be more happy with this product and how well they did with shipping it to me."
i bought these for my grandkids because their little hands just can't hold the larger cups without all the spills.  these are perfect for toddlers.
"My husband and I recently purchased two sets of these blankets to supplement the various store brands that we own. These receiving blankets are superior to all the other brands we own.<br /><br />They are larger than brands bought from Kohls and Wal-mart. They are a solid 30 x 40 inches which is more than adequate for wrapping up a small infant. None of the other brands came close to this size and they drew up substantially in the wash on the first washing. Not so with these Carter blankets. They can handle multiple washings with little shrinkage.<br /><br />I don't know about you but receiving blankets take some abuse here. When you have a newborn, I've found that anything will do in a pinch...so receiving blankets get put through the ringer as towels and burp cloths, etc. These blankets seem well equipped for the job. Overall, they are of great quality.<br /><br />They are pretty shades of 100% cotton flannel in mixed prints of brown and pink. They are soft on baby's skin.<br /><br />I am happy to have bought these in two sets. They are a little hard to find online sometimes and I wish I had bought a couple more sets."
"We love this paci tether!  As with all toys, parents should watch for degradation of materials.  We use this as a tether, not a 'teething' toy.  When I see a crack, I remove the bead, removing just 1 or two beads does not render this tether useless.  I've only lost 1 bead on each of the tethers I own (2)."
Our particular daughter Mia loves the pink binkys so she was very happy to receive these in the mail quickly
The product was purchased as a gift and the new Mom loved it.  She thought it was very clever. It was delivered in a timely fashion and there weren't any problems to report.
"My daughter was having a hard time keeping her paci in, and every time we put her to bed it would pop out and she would start fussing until we came and put it back in. I wanted something to prop it in there with but didn't want to have a suffication hazard so I found the Wubbanub! & it worked like magic! We set it on her chest or on the bed next to her and it keeps her paci in until she doesn't want it. Also she Loves to hold on to the soft giraffe- it's like a double soothe. It was smaller than I thought which I was happy about. I didn't want anything to overwhelming for her. (It's about the size of a beanie baby) Everytime we go places people are always commenting on how cute it is.. and how cute she is with it!"
"I am so pleased with this adorable erosion of the elephant wubbanub. This product is not only cute, it's a lifesaver for babies who constantly spit out their pacifier. Highly recommended."
I tried countless other pacifiers with no luck before finding these. My son loves these and they really help him at nap time. Glad to find them because the stores are no longer carrying them.
"Great, I just loved the baby MUTE BUTTON pacifier! It arrived in a timley manner in great condition and looked even better than described in the ad."
"What I love most is the fact that its one piece & easy to clean,<br /><br />Also- these are extremely cheap"
"MY SON LOVES LOVES LOVES THESE They are softer than the ones from WALMART. They are bendy, and he is 5 months now, but took them well since he was born. I love the cut out so it doesn't cover his nose, like the old ones from the hospital"
"I ordered these pacifiers for my grandson because they were like the older style I had used with my kids.  They were shown in blue, and said colors may vary, and I knew without a doubt, we would end up getting the pink ones.  We have a boy and wanted any other color except the pink.  He does like these pacifier's better than his other ones, but my daughter won't use them when we take him out anywhere in public. He's only 2 months old and you can't really tell if he is a boy or girl at this age."
We have other Wubbanubs but wanted something different. This is a very cute pony and matches many outfits. The baby likes this paddy just as well as his first one.
Eco friendly and safe. My baby is 100% breastfed and took these with no hesitation. He likes to suck a lot and momma needed a break. I love the fact that these are 100% natural hevea rubber.
"My 3 day old granddaughter came a little early - 36 weeks, 5 lb 12 oz - and she would just gag on any other pacifier.  The lamb is really cute and it helps keep the pacifier in her mouth.  Highly recommended."
"My wife has wanted a Serta sheep for years and I finally got her this little guy a little while ago and she loves it.  It is well made, the price was good, and it is just all around very cute."
"My daughter absolutely loves these pacifiers!  She won't take any other kind, plus they are super cute..... we have the giraffe and pink pony as well and i am always getting compliments on them."
"I'M SUPER HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. ITS WAY BETTER THAN WHAT ITS DESCRIBE AS . ITS SUPER CUTE, GREAT QUALITY , IT CAME WITH THE PACIFIER IT ARRIVED ON TIME. I WOULD LOVE TO BUY MORE SUPER SATISFIED. PERFECT SIZE FOR A BABY."
"When I saw this pacifier attacher, I thought it was the cutest thing ever! Honestly, I didn't want my son using a pacifier past six months old, but I'm picking my battles. I ordered this when he was about four months old. When he was about five months old, he was able to put the paci in his mouth by himself. I think having the giraffe attached to it made it easier for him. This all translates into longer naps and more sleep at night. We get so many compliments on how cute this thing is. I think when we're ready to wean him off of the paci we will cut it off and still let him play with the giraffe. But seriously, he loves it!"
My son loves this teddy. It puts him to sleep and soothes him. It also helps him stay in a deep sleep. Sometimes if I shut it off too soon he will wake up instantly and cry. Best $20 I've spent in a while!!!!!
Pacifiers were as I expected them to be. Good price for a busy mom who can't always make it out to the store after the puppy eats another binky.
Bought this little bear for my baby because she was having a hard time keeping the soothie in her mouth without someone holding it. She sleeps with it at night and even when she doesn't use the paci she falls asleep cuddling it! So CUTE!!
"We love these binks.  I also like that with the size 2, gunk doesn't build up around the base of the nipple.  Stays very clean."
"My daughter was always a bit of a pacifier addict but once we switched from Soothies to these at about 5 months, she didnt want to let them go. The other amazing thing is that with the loop on the back she can carry them around on her own very easily AND when she was smaller, the bulb style ones made it much harder for her paci to fall out and wake her up. My daughter is now 10 months old and has been through many of these. I know they aren't as cute in color but being natural and seeing how much she loves them has encouraged me to continue to purchase them. Now I just have to figure out how to get her to not want them anymore since she is almost 1 : ("
"My son loves NUK at all times. He is 4.5 months now. we try to avoid the paci during day. In the night we let him have one.<br /><br />NUK fits his mouth perfectly. He does spit it out once in a while but mostly he holds it in..<br /><br />Soothie - well he doesn't recognize soothie as a pacifier. For some reason, he doesn't suck on it most of the days. Even when he is cranky, he will not suck on soothie for long. Probably the shape of it doesn't appeal to him. I cannot talk about how habit forming it is, as my son is just 4.5 months old.<br /><br />NUK Pros:<br /><br />My son loves it, he is able to hold it in his mouth for long periods<br />Orthodontic, so I worry less about my sons teeth allignment<br /><br />NUK cons:<br /><br />Water enters the nub when I wash the paci. I squeeze and shake to get it out.<br />Sometimes when he sucks it for too long, the shape of the exterior of the paci leaves an impression around his lips.<br />In amazon, pink color and green color are paired, boy colors are not exclusive."
"We absolutely love our Elle it is the cutest thing ever! Great product!  Would definitely recommend, if your baby likes smoothie pacifiers"
"It is hard to find the silicone pacifiers in the biggest size, but not on Amazon. My son refuses to use the latex kind. This is his favorite. Now we just need to figure out how to break the habit."
I got a few of the Gumdrop pacifiers from the hospital when my daughter was born 4 months ago and I love them.  She's not a paci addict like my son was so it helps to have the hole that I can stick my finger in to help her grip it.  We still have a few unused from the hospital but I wanted to buy some in different colors.<br /><br />Note: I tried the Nuk pacifiers too because we received some at our shower but she would not even keep them in her mouth.  I don't think she liked the shape of the nipple.
I got this for my 10 month old son. I wasn't sure if he would like it because this is not the brand of pacifier he normally uses but he loves it!! I plan on getting him more!
I love this pacifier. The fact that it's one piece is great! Easy to keep clean and it's safe for baby!
"These are really great. Daughter loves them. The only thing is that a little water gets in it when you wash them, but I think that happens with all pacifiers. They are cute and do the trick. They don't leave a mark on the face like the Nuks do."
"I love these rubber pacifiers! I love that they are chemical free & come from a natural plant, the rubber tree, vs being manufactured like silicon. My little one loves to suck on these!"
I bought this (and a couple of other designs) for my niece that I will be visiting soon.  It is adorable!  I hope she loves the functionality of it as much as I'll love looking at her using it.  I really like the fact that it is machine washable.  I'm going to suggest to the Momma to either keep it in the memory box when the baby outgrows using it.

This pacifier is beautiful!! I bought it for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it!! She thinks its the cutest thing in the world! I will definitely be buying more from this buyer! Shipped fast and had ZERO PROBLEMS
"We had basically weaned my two year old of the pacifier - but we bought this one to use for his Halloween costume.  It made the whole costume and was completely adorable.  We got lots of comments, and since he already liked pacifiers, he had no trouble keeping it in his mouth.  He was pretty much the cutest vampire ever.<br /><br />We only used it for that purpose - and thankfully our big boy had no trouble giving these up for good after! :)"
"It is very funny to see my nephew walking around with this pacifier, he loves it and it doesn't break when it falls down."
"I love these pacifiers. My son was born into the NICU and was given the same pacifier. I thought it was big and ugly, so I tried to get him to use the smaller ones, he refused. I found these one day and loved the different animals on the end. I throw the whole item in the washer and dryer, then wash off the pacifier with soap and water before I give it to my son. He loved it, he would hold on to it's arms and pluck it into his mouth when just a few months old. Then when I no longer wanted him to use a pacifier, I cut it away and he was still able to comfort himself with the stuffed animal. They also make great gifts!"
"We love our Wubbanub! It's great for my son who's not all into binkys, but when he's tired the likes to have this guy around to hold on to. His old binky would fall out of his mouth and wake him up. If this falls, he just grabs it, puts it back in and falls right back to sleep! Makes a great shower gift, too."
Gumdrop pacifiers were the ones my daughter was sent home with from the hospital and the only ones she would take from then on lol they work great and without them I dont think she would have ever soothed herself back to sleep on those restless nights lol.
"My family and I love these pacifiers because they are all one piece. They are, sanitary, easy to clean, no hard pieces and all natural."
"I ordered the Wubbanub Monkey for my expecting daughter-in-law.  She has decided my grandson's nickname is going to be lil monkey.  I thought this would be a perfect little gift to add to my growing collection of gifts for my first grandbaby.  My daughter in law loves, loves, loves this monkey.  She said it was her favorite gift at her recent baby shower. Even though my grandson is not born yet, I am sure this pacifier will always be his favorite."
This Boston Red Sox Baby Set was such a delight to give as a gift. The whole set is very cute and hard to find in stores. I am very pleased with the whole set and will be back when we need another baby gift.
"This Pacifier is ADORABLE!!  I really loved it, the caption says it all!  Good Price & Good Quality.  Amazon Always!"
"Bought these for my new great-nephew. From what I understand, these are 'good ones'. Something about the inside construction. Anyway, these are his favorites, of course.<br /><br />Go Blue!"
"My daughter has really chubby cheeks. As an infant, the sides of paci's would almost cut into her cheeks. But these particular pacis don't. They curve away from the face a bit. So much more comfortable. They leave NO lines on her face. These are the only pacis that I've found that curve away. The clear color is hard to find once dropped. So stock up!!!"
"My son LOVES his Mango Monkey Wubbanub. The original we have had for 15 months. It is starting to get worn out. The pacifier ripped out when it got stuck in the couch a few months back which was totally my friend's fault, and had nothing to do with the integrity of the construction. I resewed it (no easy feat) and promptly ordered a back up. My son still prefers the original, but was excited to see the new one. It washes easily in the washing machine. The size is perfect and the different textures and colors are fun. When he was really little it was fun to watch him manipulate the monkey to get the pacifier back in his mouth. He was able to do that at about 4 months, so no more looking for dropped binkies in the middle of the night."
"What I love most is that this pacifier is completely rubber (no hard plastic part) so I know that if my baby accidentally rolls over it and it's under her cheek or something, it won't hurt her (and believe me, she has slept on it several times).  Even though this pacifier doesn't have a little ring you can hold on to, you can stick your finger inside it to hold onto it.  This is the one that hospitals use, plus they're easy to wash.  I just wish it came in more colors!"
"My son loves this! It helped him hold the pacifier in which was great, and he loved holding on to the dog! And it was much easier to find when it dropped on the ground since it didn't roll under the couch. Love it!"
My baby loves this pacifier and i'm pleased that she does it really comforts and soothes her so no fuss for her and no headache for mommy.
wubannubs have to be the best pacifier by far. I think it's the least likely to mess up a toddlers teeth!!!!
Great product. Just like the hospitals use. Bought pink/ purple for girl twin and green for boy twin so I can keep paci's separate!
Really nice little carrier keeps pacifier at hand (easily attaches to diaper bag strap) and clean.  Provides a way to keep from digging at the bottom of the diaper bag for pacifier.  I love that I had such an assortment of colors to choose from.  There's a color/pattern for everyone.
"Not only is it so flippin' cute (well, it is a giraffe!) but it is very useful. My 4 month old son loves to hold things when drifting of to sleep, and helps to keep the binky in his mouth! He is a preemie and his sucking ability isn't very strong. He holds on to it quite tightly! Only bad thing is you can't replace the binky if damaged."
My sister in law says that this will definitely help when the baby is born if he takes it. She is so excite and so nervous for this is her first one.
"We love using these pacifiers! They are sturdy, easy to wash, and BPA free! One thing I really like about Phillips AVENT is that they come with convenient cover, which is EXCELLENT when you are putting the pacifier in your bag or pocket so it doesn't get dirty. And the biggest plus is that our little one really likes to use it and it makes him happy."
"I researched what was the best pacifier for the nursing baby.  This product came highly recommended, I agree.  This was the only pacifier my nursing baby would take.  My only complaint is that it collects dust and other stuff so you will need to wipe it periodically.  The tab sticking out did not seem to bother my sleeping baby.  She loves her pacifier."
This little cow is so soft and floppy. Perfect for your newborn. My grandson has a few of the different designs but this one I ordered for a shower gift and was so pleased with it when it came. The underbelly part is a flowered soft cotton waffled material that you find in recieving blankets. Sweet.
My baby girl refused all pacifiers until this one. I am so happy I bought this. She doesn't care too much for pacifiers anyhow but at least she takes this one every now and then. I highly recommend these to all parents. They seem much more durable than your standard pacifier too. Love these!
These are the best kind of pacifiers if you plan to breastfeed.  Have used these before and my babies seemed to like them the best.
These are more expensive but calming our little one makes it so worth it. These are the only ones she doesn't spit back out. I also like that it doesn't imprint on her face like the plastic ones did.
I got this to late we switched him to a different paci waiting for this to come in mail but it's soo soft and adorable
"Wasn't sure I could get these anywhere, but was so happy to see them online, since the one that she got when she was born was almost MIA yesterday and that can be a problem with an infant.  So stocked up on these and love the different colors. only downside is that everything gets stuck to the material the paci is made of, so constantly washing off fuzzies/hair"
"A must have for a fun baby shower! Can't say that the babies are into it, but I know my two year old nephew loves to walk around with this in his mouth and get some laughs!"
"Great product, that does not hide the baby's face. I do not have anything more to say regarding this item."
"Like that this one could be used w/ the soothies brand pacifiers. Not using it too much yet, because don't want anything clipped on my infant, as it kinda gets in the way now, but will certainly use down the road and attaching in carseat/stroller.  Just wish I knew what design I was getting ahead of time."
My beautiful baby girl eschews all other pacifier brands/models except for these ones.  These are well-designed with an indentation for you to hold it with your finger (and your baby can feel your finger) and to keep it in their mouth.  The lip of the pacifier is also useful for parents to hold the pacifier in their mouth and keep their two hands free.
Received quickly. Loved it...a gift for the birth of my first grandbaby and ALL were pleased and amused with this item! A hoot!
None available.
We got one of these pacifiers at the hospital when my baby was born. I bought others after we came home but he really liked these best. I recommend them for any baby.
"This is not only a pacifier but a wonderful first toy for an infant. My baby loves this toy and is ahead of the game with her hand coordination because of it. She is always playing with it and enjoys putting it in and out of her mouth, improving not only her coordination but her focus as well. She could successfully put this in her mouth from her chest at just over 2 months. No other binkie will do, she has no interest in them, we have 3 and she loves them all. Easy for mom to find in a jam too!"
"I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free."
"These pacifiers are all my daughter will use. We came home from the hospital with a green one. I love the pink and purple ones. I tried giving my daughter the ones for 3+ months, but she prefers the newborn ones, even though she is now 9 months. She can put them in herself, and she even like to chew on the back of them for teething."
"These are perfect for our diaper bag! And they dont bother the baby at all. Im sure you moms know how often a pacifier gets dropped, so it is kind of neccesaary while out and abouy."
"I received two WubbaNub's at my baby shower. My son & I both loved them. So, as a gift for a friends baby shower, I ordered the caterpillar from Amazon. It's so cute for a baby girl! It arrived quicker than expected & was exactly what I wanted."
"My daughter doesn't use a pacifier, but this is great for her to nibble on while she's having trouble falling asleep.  She loves it and it's easy for her to keep close."
Got this for my 2 year old daughter who loves binkis...  this is one of her favorites.  She has about twenty of them and she carries them around in a small tray.  She enjoys making people laugh with this particular binki.
The pacifier arrived quickly and as described. It is really cute and very fitting for my first granddaughter due to be born very soon
My little boy loves these. We have been using the duck since he was born. I got this one to keep one at my mom's house. He loves to hold them and it's easy for them to put back in their mouth.
"My grandson won't take a pacifier no matter how many different kinds we've tried.<br />But this product is great. Just as promised and lightning fast delivery. It's not their fault the kid won't take it, LOL!"
"My daughter is obsessed w/her Wubbanubs (yes, we have 6 of them).  This one is SO CUTE and totally girly.  It washes very nicely too.  A couple others we have are covered in lint after washing and this one isn't.  Worth the price!"
"It is great.  Can't live without it.  You can only appreciate this if you have a child that loses his binky in the middle of the nite....easy to locate...happy, quiet child :)"
My grandson loves his dino pacifier.  He is 2 months old and is calmed by the pacifier and likes to hold the soft dinosaur.
"my baby had gas/constipation because of a tongue tie issue. this was great to give him some gripe water. he took it at 3 weeks old without any issues, even though he is breastfed. it is easy to assemble and easy to clean. will be nice to have as he gets older."
"i am quite satisfied with this car seat. easy to install, easy to use, the colors are pleasant. i am using this seat forward facing. my daughter loves it, and so do i. i would recommend this seat to a friend."
"great product! moving into a house with carpet in the dining room --- our son is a spiller/thrower, so  this will keep the carpet clean while looking nice. heavy enough to stay put, light enough to travel if needed."
My son loves his frog! I think almost every child has a comfort toy and this is his. I put it through the washer and dryer just about every week and so far (8 months later) it's holding up just fine.
"We bought these for our son once he was about 3 months old and switched him over from the [[ASIN:B0045I6IAO Philips 2 Pack AVENT Soothie Pacifier, Green, 0-3 Months]].  It took him a little while to get accustomed to them but accepted them pretty much right away, so we never had to test out any other pacifiers.  I highly recommend buying a couple of packs of these since they always seem to disappear!  Make sure to get a [[ASIN:B004323NHS Booginhead PaciGrip Pacifier Holder, Delicate Dot Green]] to attach to it!!"
"I never used a pacifier for my daughters, but since I can't get in the back to comfort my son on car trips I decided to introduce a pacifier. He wasn't thrilled with the ones commonly sold in stores, so I did a little research and found that breast fed babies tend to accept this one, with the vanilla scent.<br /><br />It being clear, it's kind of fun to watch his little mouth sucking on this."
"My son has had some sort of break out or allergic reaction to regular pacifiers since he was around 3 months old.  I have tried EVERYTHING you could possibly think of to clear it up.  Medications, creams, pacifiers with more vents, all different brands, latex, silicone, and even tried breaking him of using a pacifier all together.  He would have red bumps on the area around his mouth that would sometimes form blisters, crack, and bleed.  At 6 months old I finally bought these pacifiers as my last resort and since using them we have not had any breakouts at all!!<br />It has been wonderful for my son and me."
"This is the second wubba nub I bought for my daughter. I got her first one as a shower gift. She has the lamb, monkey & pink elephant. She is almost 6 months & this was the last one I got for her at 5 months. She LOVES it and never really took a pacifier until these. She loves to put the animal in her mouth too & she chews on it. Many people think they're a pain because you can't clean them but I throw them in the washing machine all the time with her laundry. I don't put it in the dryer...I just let it air dry."
"Fantastic!So much better than snapping it on to their clothing!They have the pacifier,as well as,a toy!!I would recommend this for any new mother or grandmother!"
This is the only pacifier my daughter will take. It has give in it unlike other pacifiers so it's more natural.
"I am very happy with my monkey wubbanub. It is small enough to be comfortable for an infant.  I think it is so cute, hopefully the baby enjoys it!"
My kiddo loves this! Great for when babies are small. The nipples are shaped perfect for babies mouths and the animal makes it easy to hold and recognize. I always buy these for baby gifts and all the mothers rave about it and ask where they can get more. I have 2 of the same so I can change them out to wash.
"Someone gave us one of these as a gift and we thought it was funny until we started using it, now we can't live without it. Our favorite part about this pacifier is finding it in the bed at night. It is much easier to search for this than anything else. My daughter through the first one out of the car and we lost it. We only made it one night without it before we found this one online and ordered it. My only regret is not ordering 2 just in case."
I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!  But the best part? It is so much fun!  People love to respond when they see it!  Very happy with this purchase!
"I had purchased one of these for each of my previous children so i thought i would buy one for my newest addition. Once again i was not disappointed. My son loves it and it goes everywhere with us. It has helped my son sleep in his crib over night, it gives him something to cuddle with. In short I love it!"
I ordered these because they are the pacifiers they give the babies in the hospital. They arrived on time and i am pleased with the product.
Avent is a great brand and there products are always 5 stars.<br />These pair of pacifiers are really good material and excelent choice for newborn babies.
I ordered this wubba for my youngest son and he loves it! He loves all his wubbanubs but this one is the cutest :)
"My son is a Natursutten pacifier junkie, and I just ordered the new butterfly style, and he loves them as much as the original!<br /><br />These also double as a fabulous teether. The texture and the density are perfect for soothing sore gums."
"Our baby boy used this and it helped to keep the binky in place, he would hold the doggy like hugging it while the binky stayed in his mouth. We got lots of compliments as to how cute he looked with that binky. I wish he liked pacifiers past 4 months so I could buy more of these, the are super cute and durable...good quality!"
"the little masks are so cute. i was so impressed with the quality. even the back of the mask is very well made and nicely finished. the elastic part is covered in fabric and feels comfortable to wear. you will not be disappointed with this purchase.<br />i'm not sure if it's obvious in the description but these masks are for children, probably suitable for 18 months- 6 years. it will fit on an adult's head because the elastic is very stretchy but the nose doesn't fall in the right place and it will look funny. this is a small thing but the eye opening placement is a little awkward, they seem a little too far apart. my son can still see through it but the spacing is strange, even for an adult."
"i was startled when i pulled this out of the box because it was so much bigger than i thought it would be.  i saw the pictures other people posted of their babies using this in the sink, and figured i could do the same.  i was completely wrong -- it's way too big for that.  i guess some people have really huge sinks!  so i was initially disappointed that i had to use this in the tub with a 2-wk-old baby -- but i loved it almost as soon as i tried it.  it's soft with plenty of cushioning so she's relaxed and comfortable.  the material holds in water and stays warm.  the head is slightly angled upward so it's harder for the standing water to get into her ears.  it's easy to squeeze out and hang up to dry on the shower rod (though it takes until the next day to get completely dry).  i haven't had any issues with it getting smelly, after 4 months of twice-a-week use.  but the directions on the tag clearly tell you how to wash it, if it does start to smell.  now that my daughter's bigger and her feet reach past the bottom, she loves kicking her feet in the water.  i think i'm going to start gifting these to pregnant friends."
"our baby was born with some breathing issues.  they are mild, but sent my first time mom mind into a tailspin!  this monitor works wonderful!  it is so nice to be able to roll over at night and flip on the monitor and see her as opposed to having to go into the other room and wake her up to check on her.  and knowing that the alarm would sound if no movement was detected.  the only issues we have had have been our own fault (ex.  forgetting to pause the monitor when lifting the baby out of the crib) but once the learning curve was over, it was fantastic!  i'm so glad we have this for our first baby and thrilled to be able to use it with our next child whenever that day may come!"
"this play yard was even nicer than i expected. you can see the 4 legs for support, but there is also more built in support underneath.  the construction is heavy duty yet not heavy.  setup takes less than a minute and there is lots of play room.  you could easily put more than one child in the play yard and still have plenty of room for toys. it also comes with a nice soft cotton blend sheet. this play yard is the best quality i have seen and i am very pleased."
"i'm a full-time mom, so i only needed a pump for occasional use, to build up a little stock in the freezer or for the odd day when i was going to be away from the baby. this pump is perfect for that.  it's plenty powerful - the variable suction strength more than exceeds what i need to pump as efficiently as possible.  i usually use it plugged into an outlet, but i've had to run it on the batteries probably a dozen times so far and i'm still on the original set of batteries.  it's compact and comes with a carry bag so everything stays together in my day bag when i'm out of the house.<br /><br />some other reviewers had problems with the flange - i haven't had any issues so far, but medela includes an extra two or three flanges with the pump, so it's an easy fix if something happens.  and yes, condensation builds up in the tubing during a pumping session, but i've never had the condensation reach even halfway down the tube toward the motor.  and the instruction book clearly says that if you run the pump (detached from the bottle) for a few minutes after you're done pumping, the condensation clears out.  works like a charm!"
"i could not find a cup for my son and he drank from this one during the first try!! great cup, doesn't leak and very easy to use. can't go wrong with this cup!"
"we love these bottles. the extra pieces to wash aren't really a pain, we either just soak them in hot suds then rinse or put them in the munchkin dishwasher basket and run them in there."
i will use this for pictures not so much for the main puropose of being a toy. good size though
i love this pillow! it's a comfortable size and it doesn't flatten out with use. it provides good support... my low back has felt much better since i started sleeping with this pillow.
"i bought one of these and tested today for the first time.<br /><br />i became very happy with the smart two way communication of this device. beyond the fact of the product allow the parents to talk to the baby over voice, it turns off the infrared lights of the camera when you are not viewing the baby!<br /><br />normally i dont like motorola products, but this is over my spectations!<br /><br />thank you amazon.com!"
this product is great leaves ur hands free and makes breastfeeding in public easy! easy to use and a great price. i would recommend this to any one.
"i have been cding my baby for eight months now.  i started out with aios but found that i prefer the cost-effective prefolds with snappis and covers.  i used the duo size 1 with small prefolds for seven months and they fit great until baby reached between 16 and 17 pounds, the same time she outgrew the small prefolds.  the medium prefolds fit okay in the size 1 if folded down in the back, and i probably could have stretched them out to fit until the specified 18 pounds, but as stated in other reviews, they are rather narrow (which is great for the smaller prefolds, but not so much for the bigger sizes).  i went ahead and ordered one size 2 duo to find out how well it fit.  these are much wider than the size 1 and fit the medium prefolds great, although i still have to fold them down in the back when the rise is on the smallest setting. i love thirsties for the extra leg gusset, we haven't had a poop explosion that this cover couldn't handle, even when the poop managed to get all the way around the prefold inside the cover!"
"purchase it for our daughter, she decorated her new baby's room with it.  good quality she said.  she really likes it."
I should have held off on purchasing since the hospital will give me a pacifier but I see a whole lot of babies using this
I tried a couple of other pacifiers (Nuk and playtex) and baby girl liked them just fine. I pulled the free Phillips pacifier from the hospital out because she was gumming my fingers after eating. She LOVED it and I immediately ordered two more. She alternates between sucking and gumming and I don't know which she enjoys more. Super easy to clean and doesn't get water trapped inside like some pacifiers. My ONLY complaint is that I don't know of an easy way to use a pacifier clip.
"So of course I can't NOT have my baby represent the NY Yankees, born and bred, perfect quality and very durable the vinyl colors don't seem to be wearing off. I LOVE IT"
As soon as I saw this I thought it was too funny and cute not to mention accuate. LOL It even came with a pacifier protector to keep it clean.
"My 4 month old loves this thing. He will only sleep swaddled, and when I would lay him down his binki would fall out. I'd put it back in and hold it in place until he drifted back to sleep then he'd drop it again and wake. Now, I place his WubbaNub on his chest with the binki in his mouth and when he drops or spits out the binki, it's still right there in reach for him to latch on to it as he pleases.  Of course, when he squirms it sometimes fall off his chest, but with this product I can find the paci a lot faster at night. Get one!"
"Love this so much I ordered another! I initially bought this in order to find the binki more quickly in the night.  Come to find out, my 4 month old can manipulate the binki a lot easier and is able to put it in on his own.  He occupies himself taking it out, loooking at it, and placing it back in his mouth over and over.  He is now 5 months old and chews on the animal's feet to soothe his inflamed gums!"
"These are best ever, i'm not going to get into details why, it's all been covered 500 times here already, i just wanted to give my vote and say that i am also one of the extremely satisfied parents."
"I purchased this binkie as a joke for my hubby.. He constantly is looking for my daughters pacifiers and refers to them as her mute button, so when i saw this paci.. I HAD TO GET IT.. Right now it hangs on a ribbon on our rear view mirror.."
"I use orthodontic pacifiers, so this holder is just the right size to hold 2 of them. It comes in fun colors and can be clipped onto a purse handle, diaper bag strap or stroller bar! Love it!!"
the quality of screen is very good. i'm very pleased with this product<br />you should buy it if you have a baby.
"this chicco dj baby walker, splash is a very well made product!!<br /><br />my grand daughter loves to walk in it for hours!!<br /><br />for the price i recommend this product highly!!"
my daughter wants more for their baby. it keeps her neck dry when breast or bottle feeding and it is comfortable for mother and baby. i wish these were around when i had babies.  i hated the milk pooling around their necks.  a must for every baby.
"i ordered this set for my new son's nursery and received it today. i could not be happier! the quality is amazing, the colors are beautiful, and you can't beat the price! i would highly recommend this! you won't be disappointed."
"this is a great product made by medela. i use the medela pump system so i cannot comment on whether or not this will work with other pumps but i would imagine that it would. before using this, i needed both hands to support the pumping bottles and could not do anything else while pumping. now that i have this, i can be doing other things while pumping. love it!<br /><br />i originally saw this in babies r us (for a much higher price!). there is a great sizing chart on the back of the box which made it really easy to pick the right size. since this is a soft cotton fabric, i bought the size that fits me now (2 weeks post delivery) and figure it would be very simple to have altered as i get smaller."
"the rattle is admittedly small, but adorable.  it's held up remarkably well in the few months that scarlett's been gnawing on it.  i would buy another for a baby shower basket."
love these covers. extra cute and leak proof. my son is 4 months and 18 lbs. we have tried a couple other covers and these are the most comfortable for him and havent had a leak yet. love the velcro and the snaps.
"this teether was purchased for my little guys as a baby shower gift, and my little guys were just crazy about it! they both loved this teether so much that i had to purchase another so that they both could have there own. i think that the things that they liked about it were the bright colors, and the fact that not only could they chew on it, they had the option to play with the individual pieces that they could seperate and chew on.  the things that i liked about were that it was netural, it could easily be used for a boy or a girl. (i have twin boys.) and the price. the only thing i did i did not like was the fact that it was the price to ship was more then the acutal toy but,overall a great value for something that my little guys liked so much! [[asin:b000m49mo4 fisher price monkey teether rattle]]"
i had these nursers when i had my children 20 years ago. so i knew that i had to get some for my new grand baby. would not do without them. i could not find them in any stores. online was my only option. they came shipped as ordered and on a timely basis. thanks so much.
i cloth diaper my daughter so these bags are a must have! this one is my favorite by far. i love that the draw string allows me to close the top. great product all around!
"i love this organizer. it fits my coffee, my camelbak water bottle, or any other container i use. it has a great closed pocket for money that no one sees so your money stays safe and two nice sized pockets for a key and a phone. the only thing i would change is to add a toggle to attach a pacifier or other leashed toy to."
my son is a new dad and just loves this backpack/diaper bag! he keeps it ready to go in his truck...just in case!  it's well built and is just the right size to fit all the basics...and he doesn't have to carry a \\feminine\\ looking diaper bag!
"i bought this cute little guy for my daughter. it is to replace the \\turtle\\ version of the same product that the light has burnt out in. she can't go to sleep with out these guys, she loves them! she is seven. they make the most beautiful stars around the room! i am going to see about a replacement bulb to bring turtle back to life."
"i have had this pillow for months now, so i feel i can give an informed review.  it took about a week to get used to sleeping with it and to break in the part where my head goes, but since then i have been more than happy with it -- in fact, i had my baby over a month ago and i still use it and find it incredibly comfortable.  the best part while i was pregnant was that i slept more soundly with the pillow so i didn't wake up to go to the bathroom as many times during the night, so i actually felt well-rested in the morning.  the best part now that the baby is born is that i can fold it in half in the middle of the night when the baby wakes up and it becomes a backrest for nursing - very comfortable and much better than just leaning against a regular pillow because it has \\arms\\ for more support.  one thing though:  the jersey knit cover is very comfortable and fits the pillow perfectly, but the regular cotton cover is not soft at all and it doesn't fit properly around that curved area at the top so it ends up digging into your neck/shoulder area.  stick with the jersey cover."
"i love these spouts, i used them for my first daughter and was trying to find replacements for the cups for my second daughter that just started using sippy cups. i am glad i found them on amazon!"
with twins and two kids 14 mos apart i have had my share of double strollers.  this is a great stroller for the mall or going on walks.  turns on a dime.  exactly what i was looking for. best thing about it is it fits through a doorway!
"i got this sunshade for my double jogging stroller because my youngest hates getting the sun in her eyes, but won't keep sunglasses or a hat on. yes, it is basically just a large piece of fabric that you tie onto your existing sunshade, but it really works great. my existing sunshade is flat, so the flexible fabric of the protect a bub kind of comes down a bit to protect in the morning or the afternoon when the sun is not straight up. (i wonder why a jogging stroller doesn't have a better sunshade - it only gets used outside! go figure) i have done both a long run and a sprint workout and there is no sign of this thing even loosening up. better yet, no crying from the wee one about the sun being in her eyes. definitely a good investment."
we have been cloth diapering for a little over a month and so far this is my favorite cover.  love the gussets at the legs and the fits works really well on our 5 1/2 month old. we use mainly fitted kissaluvs with it and it's not too bulky.  plus the print is super cute.
"the skirt is really cute in person, and a great deal for the price. the hot pink is definitely a bright pink color (not quite as muted as the picture) which is what we were hoping for."
"of all of the things we've bought for our baby, this is the item i appreciate the most.  this fantastic chair is super lightweight and portable.  when our daughter was only a month old, we'd put the chair in the kitchen so she could be with us while we cooked and ate.  we move it all over the house.  she is now 5 months old and she still loves the chair -- and the toys that come with it and easily attach/detach.  this is the best $$$ i have ever spent on anything in my life."
this car seat really lives up to its hype. it is very easy to use and my daughter loves. thanks amazon!!!
"we purchased this car seat for our daughter and it has worked out perfectly. we have the \\latch\\ hooks in our car, so installation is a breeze. the only thing i would change about it is the overall size. it simply does not fit anywhere but in the center of the back seat. i know that's the safest place in most cars, but, our bmw 3 series just doesn't have the room to put her anywhere else, even though i'm sure it's just as safe. the stroller itself is bulky, as all the rest of the reviews have said, but we haven't had an issue with it. it still fits in our trunk, so that's all we care about."
i bought this play gym for my 3 month old daughter. she loves to kick so much i thought she would enjoy the piano. she fell in love with the mirror and the piano feature. she moves around so much on it that she move out of the view of the mirror and then become frustrated because she can no longer see herself. i would definitely recommend this play gym. it has a lot of features to keep your little one entertained and bright colors to excite them. my daughter also loves to have tummy time on the mat too.
"received this item last week.  easy to install.  used them on our new bar counter top.  in the 2 weeks that we lived in the house, we had 1 accident and 3 near misses with our children running around in the house.  this has made the corners very soft, just incase they get too close again.  the color is a little lighter that what i had thought it would be, but it still blends in with our counter tops."
"i highly recommend the boba 2g! as an experienced babywearer (stretch and woven wraps) i have to say that the boba is up there at the top of my favourite carriers list. we're on a tight budget so price was definitely a deciding factor but if you're considering a soft structured carrier, don't let the lower price of the 2g fool you into thinking that it's not as good as a beco or ergo. my 19lb, 14 month old rides comfortably on my back or front  and i can wear him for extended periods of time without getting a back ache."
"this gate is amazing.  i have 3 of them set up in my home.  they are a little more difficult to install than the usual baby gate, but once it's done, they are wonderful.  i had other pressure gates that wore the wood down on the door casing so i had to keep readjusting so it would be tight enough, and then it would wear the casing down further.  with these gates, the presure holds the gate in place, but the swinging part of gate never touches the wood casing.  what a brilliant idea!  i would recommend this gate to anyone, not only for children, but pets too."
"this is a must have! my baby is restless and this baby swaddler was a life saver! my baby actually wants to be swaddled, it makes her feel all cozy like she was in the womb. when she is feeling a little stressed out, i just wrap her in this and she calms right down and falls asleep. one recommendation is to make sure the velcro is covered before washing as it make snag other fabrics. also, i didn't know this before, but the little slot in the booty are is for a car seat or swing buckle, so your little one can be snug as a bug but still safe in their seat. definitely recommend this."
"i switched to cloth diapers a few months ago due to my daughter suffering from frequent rashes. we were trying to rid her of a nasty yeast rash while using cloth. so, i decided to try these liners to 1. keep her skin dry and 2. protect cloth from barrier cream! i am happy to report these liners keep her very dry in terms of a barrier between prefold diapers that are absorbent, but wet feeling. this is the perfect solution! i am very thankful for this product and will continue to use them. not to mention, they do a great job protecting cloth from poo :) they catch the poo and keep the cloth diaper cleaner. great product!"
"very satisfied with this item. bright, colorful & easy to apply. my son loves it & adds color to my walls without paint."
i love it it comes as shown in picture it is easy to assemble as i did it myself i took it out and it didn't fall apart on me the packaging was good ups in the stroller box no rips in box and it came early than was given will order from seller again
we had been using a standard blanket for picnics but if the ground was damp or full of debris then we were sure to have problems. this blanket is very nice. fold and stores easily. its large size accommodates the average family and it wipes clean.
"this is the perfect first book! i purchased this for my 9 month old granddaughter for christmas with the hope that her interest in books would begin early. she's very attracted to the vibrant colors and picks it up often to look through it. after reading the book, we go back through it and i name all the colors and make up more stories about each of the very cute characters and other illustrations."
"i bought this not for a baby but for a way to keep a watchful \\eye\\ on an elderly parent. it has been the perfect way to give her some space and not intrude all the time. but yet make me feel better i can see and hear how she is doing. i can hear her clearly and she can hear me. for her she still has her privacy as you can turn off the visual feed. our house is cut up in levels. and this is the perfect way to not have to run up and down steps. this was the best thing i could have gotten for our situation. no interference from phones, computers or cell phones. picture is clear both in daylight and with night vision."
it is just right for my needs to keep an ear on the kids. lasts good and battery works great!! it is clear and the volume switch is good.
"i love the avent product line.  since i last used them, they have definitely improved.  with the new rings that hold the nipple in place, i don't have any issues with the bottles leaking.  this was a very nice surprise and a change that i don't mind completing an extra step for.  as usual, they hold up great and limit the fussiness.  the pacifier covers are lifesavers since i hate putting them into the diaper bag without protection.  with the cover, i no longer have to put the pacifiers into a ziplock bag to keep them clean."
this was a great toy for my two granddaughters.  it's just the right size for their little hands and \\grabs\\ their attention with the flashing lights and variety of music. the price was very reasonable.
as a young adult i found i've acquired many stuffed animals but had no where to put them short of storage. i ordered one of these and it was here almost immediately. not only that but it holds far more than i was expecting. even left with a little slack it doesn't hang too low. i'm even thinking about buying one for my 2 year old nephew. i'm 100% satisfied with this product and the seller. will buy from again!
we bought 3 covers and originally i planned to just use them for my 21 month old for a few months before we potty train. but i gave them a try on our 2 month old baby boy and they also work well for him! i'm really pleased. i also bought the thirsties hemp/cotton inserts to use with this cover and i'm glad for that purchase too. the thirsties/bumgenius combination absorbs a lot of the wetness so i'm not changing diapers every half an hour.
"This collections storage box easily fits in my pantry for storing plastic spoons, forks, napkins etc. Love the color.  Looks very pretty.  Could be used as storage under a sink or even to store magazines.  Pretty enough to have in your living room.  Very pleased with purchase."
"Our son has had one of these since 6 months, and now at 12 months is more attached to it than ever.  we now own 3!  They're adorable and practical."
"My husband and I love this bink link!! It looks really cool and it's so unique. My son loves it as well and is constantly playing with the beads. The length is nice, it's not too short or too long, and the clip is very durable. We use this as my son's going out bink link and we have gotten tons of comments on it!!!"
"I bought this because it looked so cute online and when we received it, it looked even cuter in person! I love it so much and can't wait for our daughter to arrive in May so she can give it a try. The quality is impressive and much better than most other pacifiers I have seen. Plus you have to admit that it is so much cuter than anything you can buy at Walmart...which is ALL we have around here. I know no other mothers here will have this pacifier which keeps pacifiers from getting mixed up with other babies. I recommend it and other pacifiers made by Personalized Pacifiers! Also, If you go to their website, you can special order one with your babies name on it. :-)"
"My 3 month old prefers to suck on her fist than a pacifier - probably because they fall out so easily and she doesn't have the motor skills to put them back in, yet. But with the Wubbanub she is able to maneuver it with her arm/fist so that if the paci part comes out she can push it back up towards her mouth. We got this yesterday and she took to it IMMEDIATELY! She seems to love grasping at it while she is sucking and she is sucking at it like a champ. Finally we're able to soothe her so easily. Plus it's darn cute, too!"
"Very good product, this is the only soother my baby wants to use. The best baby soother in market. I've tried 10's of different baby soothers and finally found this one. Do not have to try any others, get this great baby soother and enjoy quiet in your house:)"
"I was hesitant to give my newborn a pacifier at all, but around 4 weeks, she became insistant that she have something to suck on as she fell asleep. I was nursing her to sleep, but it came to point that after I'd try to slip away she'd immediately wake up rooting for something to suck.<br /><br />I bought several [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] (soothies), but she was never happy with them. When I tried to slip the pacifier in place of my breast after she was asleep, she'd immediately stir & fuss.<br /><br />I bought the Natursutten pacifier because I loved that it's all natural, BPA/PVC/Phthalates-free! I was skeptical that my little girl would take any brand, but this one has worked wonders. The pacifier is large enough that it rests against her nose just like my breast. I'm able to slip away after she's done nursing & slip in this pacifier without a problem.<br /><br />I should note that my little girl has had trouble figuring out how to suck a pacifier but this one she took to very quickly. We are both very happy!"
"This is a really funny, yet still practical gift for parents. I bought it as a gift for my sister. Love it!"
"If you love your team as much as I love the cubs, then you will get this for your baby. So they can grow up loving the same team you do!"
"SO HAPPY with this wabanub! The colors are GREAT and it's so soft. Baby hasn't come yet, but that didn't stop me from playing with it on my 38 week belly and describing it to the baby. My husband thought I was crazy, but I was seriously excited about how cute this turned out to be!"
I love these it allows us to easily clean off pacifiers and teethers! Smells really good too! They are great because what is not always available.
"This product was well priced, shipped extremely fast and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to see it in action!"
"We got the monkey & loved him so much we just had to add the zebra to the mix! Zaire the zebra is very soft, rocks a Mohawk, contrasting colors are very stimulating and she is the perfect size & shape for a young baby to grab :) My little girl is just 12 weeks old and the paci seems too hard in density for her to suck but she loves to chew on it!"
"My son loves these.  One of my cannot live without baby items for sure.  They are round, like a real nipple, instead of flat, and you can put your finger inside the nipple, so they really feel like they are sucking on something."
"I recieved the item fast and as decribed,my daughter loves it,since she was born shes been all about monkeys and this was perfect for her.  Thanks so much for a great service and a perfect toy."
"Everyone who sees my 2 yr old daughter with this thinks it's cute and funny. My daughter even looks in the mirror and laughs. She loves it n so do i, perfect fit for her. The pacifier is not heavy at all."
"I love the way this little dragon looks, and it's always easy to find the baby's pacifier.  However, I do not feel that it helps our little guy keep the pacifier in his mouth at all.  He's only 2 months old and was a preemie, so he has difficulty holding onto a paci regardless.  The soothie and gumdrop pacifiers are the only ones recommended by lactation professionals for nursing babies, so I feel like if you have to use one of the soothies, why not have a cute one?  To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.  I feel like for the money the dragon costs, I'd be too afraid to botch the job! Overall, I think it's an adorable novelty, but not incredibly useful.  We just appreciate it for being cute and the baby looks sweet with the little dragon laying on his chest, it looks like they're kissing."
Mothers and babies love them there are many animals to choose from. Enough to match any baby's decor no matter what
"I bought this as a little treat for my daughter, who is due in June, I'm sure she will love it.  This item is just as cute in person as on the web.  At first I thought it was smaller than anticipated, but that has more to do with me skipping over the measurement description than any real issue.<br />My husband is excited too, who doesn't love dragons???"
"Our Brian loves this pacifier! He holds on to it for dear life, and just loves the little monkey. This is one clever design, and it's the second one we've purchased in this series. I guarantee we'll be back for more, because the baby just loves it so much."
Have 4 month old twins and wubbanub's are all our babies have ever had.  We currently have 8 different ones.  4 for our daughter and 4 for our son!!!!  I'm sure we will buy more.  These are great!!!!
I purchased this as a Christmas gift and it made the entire day!  We all couldn't stop laughing when the baby put it in his mouth!  Definitely makes for great pictures on facebook and chuckles!!!
"We got our Soothie 2-pack today, while my son was napping.  I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look... I think it's hilariously cute.    Update 2/19/12 - Still loving the Soothie, still refusing any and all other binkies.  Longer review on my blog:    [...]"
"My little girl loves this toy, and she doesn't even really go for pacifiers usually.  I love how dino is easily grasped and she hasn't lost him yet (she's 7 months old now)!  She likes to chew/suck on the pacifier itself, the sides of the pacifier, and dino's nose, hands and feet.  As for cleaning, the tag says not to machine wash or submerse, but I usually just use a little soap and suds him up by hand, let him dry overnight.  Dino seems no worse for the wear."
"This pacifier simulates like advertised and everything. And its the closest looking nipple to me, as i strictly breastfeed. Ive tried several pacifiers for her but she just wont have it. But to a breastfed baby who likes pacifiers but is picky, this would be great i think."
This produst met my expectations. It was used for a gift for my friends babyshower and she loved it. The sparkles are so cute :) I would recommend this. And will be buying this again for another babyshower.
"My daughter loves her 'Monk Monk'!! He goes everywhere with us! It really helps that she can hold onto it and play with the stuffed animal while she's 'pacify-ing.' It is also more convenient for me to find 'Monk Monk' in her diaper bag, all the other pacifiers fall to the bottom and I constantly have to dig to find them.  You should definitely get one!"
This is the best pacifier on the market.  This is the type that they gave us in the hospital and my daughter won't use anything else.  We had other one's around but she always grabs this one.  It's nice also that it comes in other colors other than green.  We really love them.
"My baby loves the wubs! He has 5 and now we're waiting for the sixth to get here today. We have only lost one that he dropped at a large department store. These are awesome because the babies can find them in their crib at night, they don't slip through the slots and they are soooo cute!"

"I ordered some pacifiers from Personalized Pacifiers online and they are the only ones my daughter will take now. We needed a few extras to have in the diaper bag, car and bed so we ordered this one and a couple others. I LOVE this paci, we get so many compliments on it that I'm going to order another one as a back up. We've even sterilized it and the Zebra print didn't fade or wash off at all!"
"Great product for keeping a paci in an infant's mouth!  I wish I had known about it sooner.  Monkey is cute, too.  I can see my son learning to love it."
"We were running low on pacifiers, so decided to try out a new style.  Our daughter is 4 months old, and she is hooked on these.  Unlike the other ones we've used (soothies), she never spits this one out, even when we pick her up or carry her.  It also seems that the design gives her more freedom to breathe than other pacifiers.  Whatever it is, she loves these!"
"this pacifier lasts for very long, has great sweet designs that varies a lot, and has the air circulation holes in middle which we appreciate..  My son literaly throws any different pacifier I try to give im at me..<:"
"Why didn't I think of this? My daughter loves her giraffe. We have the duck and the puppy dog and decided to get her the giraffe since it was so cute. The duck and giraffe are nice and thin and light, making it easier for her to hold and not fall out of her mouth because of the weight. The puppy is really bulky and heavy and we had a hard time keeping up with it. She loves to play with the ears of the giraffe as well. It's great becuase the pacifers alone are rubber and bounce when they hit the ground. Attached to the stuffed animal, we haven't had to get down on our hands and knees looking for it. It's great!"
It works great our daughter uses it all the time. It was recommended by a friend of ours so we tried it and its a good thing we did its pretty cool.
i love these! im so glad i got the blue ones too. it said color may vary and i was worried i would end up with a girl color. i have other pacifiers i received as gifts but so far i think these are the best. its so cool they glow in the dark.
The sound it makes resemble more a truck passing by than in uterus sound BUT the battery lasts for ever and my little man seems to enjoy it anyway!
"These are the PERFECT baby shower add on gift.  My son is by no means fussy but this little buddy is his favorite car seat companion for the traffic ridden commute to daycare.  The nook is attached to the little animal making it easy for the lil ones to grab hold in the early days when the fine, hand to nook skills are a little lacking.  And if that wasn't enough reason, they are washing machine safe.  Highly recommend!"

"I was hesitant to buy this at first because we only use the Gumdrop Pacifiers and I didn't see how I could attach those to the bear. It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now."
i loved it my niece looked so cute=) im gonna end up buying more as soon as i start having my own kids they look funny and its a unique pacifier..
"I bought this pacifier for my nephew in Brazil. My brother in law is a joker and I thought this pacifier would bring lots of fun. It's a great quality material and come with instructions to sanitize before using it, which I think is very important."
"It all started at the hospital where they gave us a soothie pacifier. Yes, I know the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend introducing a pacifier until much later, but I requested it. Anyhow, I only had a vague idea about the different shapes pacifiers came in. My first reaction when I saw the soothie was what a weird shape this pacifier has! Especially the part where you're supposed to hold it. Of course the looks didn't matter much to our baby. She liked it. We tried the NUK orthodontic pacifier and very soon it was quite obvious that our daughter would only take the soothie pacifier so I bought some more soothies and our little girl likes them very much. We've used them now for two months and have not run into any issues."
"OK, I have waited quite some time to write this review BUT these are the only binky's my little girl will take.   It was really bad when I was traveling because I had lots of extras (which I ended up losing). So, I stopped on emergency to a local store and picked up The First Years comparable binkys.... No, no, no. She would not take them. I've even tried several other times since and refuses them. (They look a little and feel different.) Anyhow, thank goodness I was traveling to my friend's house who is a nurse in Labor and Delivery and brought me some to take with me until I could order these! :)   If your baby takes these home from hospital and prefers them... and is picky (haha) these are the exact ones!"
Tried this one out first before buying multiples for our son.  He loves it. So we bought the giraffe and the puppy too!
"I first bought my son the brown dog Wubbanub, which he really liked, so I bought him this Dino and the lion. Not only is this Dino wicked cute, my 6 month old has shown a preference to this one over the other two. Yeah I wish there was a way to change out the pacifier part (because it's sewn in just like every other Wubbanub out there) but its very easy to clean, I just toss it in with the clothes every time I do a load of my sons laundry. This was worth every penny I spent on it!"
My baby loves his paci and the animal attached makes it so easy for him to find it!  We will definitely buy another one for our next child(ren).
"I haven't seen these in person yet, but my son and daughter-in-law both like them. She even confirmed that the actual pacifer is the same kind given to their twins in the hospital. They appear to make the pacifer both easier to stay put and easier to find."
"this product does what it is purposed for.    we have been using it for about 8 months now and haven't had any problems with it.  we can easily see what's going on from a couple of rooms away and in some instances from over 90 feet.  the battery life isn't the best, so we have to charge it everyday--that's not a big deal.  also, the microphone picks up sound amazing well.  the camera rotates, is extremely easy to mount to a wall and has a 1 click zoom feature that works nicely."
"pros: simple and fun, unique, cheap, works as a portable speaker for an mp3 player  cons: not incredibly high quality, i can see the novelty wearing off after a while  i got this as a gift for my brother who loves music and plays piano and a few other instruments.  it was great watching him go from confusion to delight as he figured out what this thing was.  a few minutes later he was playing phantom of the opera on it, experimenting with sliding the stylo vs. lifting it, laughing and saying it was the best thing ever.  even if he gets tired of it after a few days, it was worth $20."
"this wrap has saved my life! as a first time mom it was difficult for me to go shopping, do household chores etc with a baby in tow. after discovering the moby i am able to travel by (new york city) bus and train with a decent sized stroller. sometimes it is so difficult to close and open strollers while ensuring the baby's safety, with the moby i just put it on under my jacket before leaving the house. when i get to the bus stop or train station i just place baby in moby and ta-dah my both hands are free and baby is safe!!   get the moby!!"
santa brought my grandbaby a bumbo seat to nannan's house and we love it. i can set her on the large island in my kitchen while i cook. i am still within arm reach from her. the tray is a great play station.
"i hesitated to buy these bumpers after reading the reviews here, but i'm glad that i took a chance and bought them!  some of the reviews made it sound like the bumpers would collapse at the slightest touch and then remain collapsed and have to be adjusted frequently, but i haven't found this to be the case.  as long as the bumpers are put on correctly - i.e. tightly, with the panels overlapping as per the instructions - this is not a problem at all.  i am delighted at how these bumpers look and work.<br /><br />as for the look, my son's room features chocolate brown, light blue and some yellow, and these bumpers look great with the velour chocolate brown sheet in his crib - they're a really nice shade of light blue.<br /><br />as for the function, make sure the edge of the bumper is just below the top of mattress; this will help keep the bumpers in place, as well as prevent little hands and feet from getting under the bumper.  you should also make sure to install these tightly when you velcro them around the crib rails; this will allow the bumpers to spring back into position quickly after little legs and arms push down on them.<br /><br />i like that my baby can see through the bumper a little and look around his room as he likes when he wakes up in the morning.  now that he's standing, of course, he usually looks over the bumper instead of through it, but at least i know he can stand there safely, unable to use the bumpers to try to climb out.<br /><br />the only thing i don't like about this product is that changing the sheets tends to pull it out of place, as the mattress fits very tightly in the crib and rubs against the railing coming out and when it's being put back in.  but this is a problem i would have with any bumper given how tightly the mattress fits into the crib.  overall, i love these bumpers!"
"this seat is great.  it adjusts easily, transports easily, and its easy to clean.  the great thing is that i know it will work well for a long time and i could probably even save for my own grandkids."
"i did a lot of research and this stroller was exactly what i was looking for.  it's extremely light and rides super smooth.  the turning radius is great as well.  i love being able to access the basket from the front and back.  i also love the child's tray can be opened on either the left or right side.  my daughter loves being in it.  another positive is the way it closes.  it actually closes yet remains standing so it's very easy to pick up and put it in my car.  my other maclaren umbrella stroller wold crash to the ground when i tried closing it.    my only negative would be that i can't seem to get my daughter to sit up as much as i like.  since the adjustment for the relining seat is a strap, it won't allow me to pull it tight enough to have her sit up straight.  that makes it difficult for her to get her drink or snacks in the tray.  i also have a bob duallie which i love but it's very bulky and heavy.  this stroller is perfect for quick trips to the store.  i also purchased the [[asin:b005pk1g76 diono buggy buddy stroller organizer, black]] and it works perfectly.  great for holding extra drinks, cell phone, keys, etc.  don't hesitate to buy this stroller!  highly recommend!  and as always the shopping experience with amazon was amazing!"
my 2 and a half year ols great grandaughter loves her doctor kit..carries it with her when she goes out..loves to chk out if you are ok.. i remeber having one like this as a child and was happy to find one reasonably priced...also purchased dora the explorer visits doctor and dentist books...she loves having them read to her.
"i fist saw these locks at my son's daycare.  they are amazing and i love that they don't require screws, which would mess up my cabinets.  these are really easy to install and my 21 month old son can pull to his heart's delight and they don't come open.  my husband, however, has managed to pull it open and broke one of the locks, but he had to pull pretty hard to do it.  you definitely need extra keys because there is nothing more frustrating than searching for a key to open your locks, hence the broken one by my husband.  my only problem with these is that they don't work well on drawers, as the drawers have a lip on them and they can't be installed.  they work wonderfully for cabinets though.  i highly recommend them!  i think that they would also work well for a cabinet, such as a medicine cabinet, that you don't want babysitters and other people to get in to.  for that kind of use, i would definitely use the screws to install."
i loved this. it's so cute. my 2 year old wears it for painting. easily washable and adjustable for size.
"i previously had a non-digital monitor and it was driving me crazy because there was always static coming through it and i was always trying to move it to a different location to decrease the static.  i lost a lot of hours of sleep to that thing.<br /><br />so i was looking for something digital and this is just perfect.  this monitor has several things i love:<br /><br />1. there is never any static whatsoever.  all you hear is the noises that are actually happening.<br /><br />2. it isn't set too sensitive, like most monitors are.  in fact there is a noise gate, so if the room is below a certain threshold, no noise comes through.  you don't hear breathing and eyes blinking, but you do hear any cry perfectly and even any thump.  we turn on very quiet music for my older child to listen to and typically we do not hear it at all through the monitor.  that's a feature, not a bug.  anyone who thinks this is not sensitive enough must be a first parent and wants to torture themselves with every little noise.  but it does hear any little cry from across the room, even ones that are not very intense.  i would say the sensitivity is perfect.<br /><br />3. it is sooooooo convenient to have two parent units.  one stays permanently next to my bed and the other is out in the livingroom.  you can turn the volume up or down as makes sense.  also there's a visual indicator of how loud the noises are.  works very nicely---in fact it is more sensitive than the audio, so you can see noises that you can't (don't want to) hear.<br /><br />4. these units also feature a vibrate warning if a noise at a certain level occurs.  my wife loved it but i am a light sleeper and found that feature too jarring, so we don't use it.<br /><br />5. the parent units warn you if they don't have a signal (e.g., if the baby unit got unplugged or something).<br /><br />i hear people complain about the battery life in these.  i can't comment because i don't use the batteries at all.  who does?  you just leave it plugged in in the relevant location and you always know what's going on.  there may be varying opinions on the right way to use these, but i can detect no reason to use a battery at all.  if you are carrying it around with you to get the mail or something, you might be a little too paranoid.<br /><br />these monitors have been a life saver.  they perfectly address all my concerns about monitors, sound great when they need to, and don't bother me the rest of the time.  i would definitely buy them again and recommend them to others.  they have helped me sleep soundly and also confidently.  that sleep is completely golden for the sleep-deprived parent.going on.  there may be varying opinions on the right way to use these, but i can detect no reason to use a battery at all.  if you are carrying it around with you to get the mail or something, you might be a little too paranoid.  these monitors have been a life saver.  they perfectly address all my concerns about monitors, sound great when they need to, and don't bother me the rest of the time.  i would definitely buy them again and recommend them to others.  they have helped me sleep soundly and also confidently.  that sleep is completely golden for the sleep-deprived parent."
i bought this for my baby and it is a perfect mat for playtime. it is colorful with great textures. also shipped very quickly!
"as a die hard ownder of a phil & teds sport (its 6yrs old and has carried 4 kids!), we were looking for something to use daily to retire the p&t for jogging only as its gotten a bit worn out. we decided on the britax b ready. ordered the doubles seat from amazon on a sunday and it arrived tuesday morning! when i opened the box, i gasped at how gorgeous the color is on the green...very rich. the seat feels very solid, nicely padded and roomy. we didn't get the main stroller part yet so haven't \\used\\ it yet but really it feels nice. i had our almost 3 yr old sit in it and he was very comfy. i like the 5 point harness and the fact that a kid can't unbuckle it (as toddlers like to do).   overall- so impressed with the shipping speed and the color of this is stunning."
"this is much better than the stick and peel decals that you can place anywhere.  this goes on the wall just as you see (if you want it that way).  it was in about 25 pieces, but the nice thing that i wasn't expecting is inside their is a diagram on how to hang it, and the pieces are numbered.  it made putting the dotting lines up easy.  it took a little more time but looks amazing.  i have it in the kids bathroom, and it really makes the little bathroom come alive like a pirate map.  the best part is the kids love it!"
"i am so pleased with this product! i ordered this so that i could see my baby girl while she is sleeping in my bed, we co-sleep and i am usually not ready to go to bed when she does, so naturally leaving her alone on our bed was a concern. i set this up in less than 5 minutes. the picture with night vision is super clear and the sound sensitivity is great. i love that the monitor hand held is rechargeable; i hate buying batteries.   the price was well worth it and the quality is more than what i expected."
Got this for my new baby grandson Keaton. He will be born on 1-16-12 and I gave it to his parents for Christmas. They were so excited and I know he will love his little monkey paci.
"These have been a must have in my house since my daughter was born. I love them bc they can be used in so many ways...I use for pacifiers, bottles, toys, basically anything that drops or needs a quick clean. Also, no need to get the travel pack bc you can put them in a sealed baggy or I use a really small plastic container that snaps and seals shut. They don't dry out either! My daughter stopped using a pacifier at about 3 1/2 months (she's 5 months now) but I still use them all the time for the above mentioned. Must have!!!! It's also a great shower gift bc that's how I got hooked!"
I love these. My son I'm sure will too. They seem to be made very durable for babies. I can't wait for my son to be here in a couple weeks to try them out.
These are the easies to clean and best shaped pacifiers out there.  Both of my girls only took these pacifiers and I trusted them and the product.  You can't go wrong with these!
"My son would't take any pacifier before giving him this one. An added plus, u can insert ur finger to harden it if he needs extra soothing for teething. Very hygenic too as water won't come in to his mouth from any hidden place after sterilizing. I love it"
"I don't really know what it is but my little one will only take these pacifiers. I tried pretty much every brand of pacis out there and the only ones she'll take are the ones shaped like the soothies. I love the fact that they are soft so if she rolls over them they won't hurt her.  At first I was worried cuz I thought the round shape covering her nose would be a problem, but now I see it doesn't block her nose at all and she seems very comfortable sucking on them.  I think these are just great."
This is the same brand used by the hospital where our children were born.  Perfect.  This is exactly what we wanted in lovely feminine colors
Just what I was looking for good quality and priced right. Shipped very fast too. Great to put in with other sports stuff
"In true breastfeeding fashion, we waited until our son was four weeks old before offering any pacifiers to make sure we had good attachment and technique down (don't really believe in nipple confusion, but it helps everyone involved not to be stuffing a newborn's mouth with a pacifier from day one).  One we passed that magic milestone of four weeks, we opened our new Wubbanub and a fast appreciation was had--babies love to suckle!  It calms them and allows them to gather themselves in the middle of a meltdown.  It is great to carry them through to the next feeding when they get older if you are trying to sleep train.  My son falls asleep within minutes when I put him down in his crib, awake with the Wubbanub--he always spits it out after he is asleep, but no need to restuff his mouth.  The little monkey legs and arms lay on the chest and help the pacifier stay put.  He also loves to grab it with his hands and arms in a big hug.  Our other pacifiers have laid useless in the diaper bag ever since we started using this one--would not have bought any other if I had know the power of the Wubba!"
We love it! Makes paci easy to find. My 1 month old wraps his arm around it while he sucks. Helps keep it in his mouth.
My son-in-law is a Yankee fan otherwise I would have purchased Orioles.  Of course after 14 years of losing mabey Yankees was a better choice.
"We love how simple the Avent soothie pacifier is, perfect for newborns and infants. These are BPA free and are the #1 hospital recommended. Typically the hospital has them there in the green color and since we are having a girl this time, I am bringing the pink/purple one from home :)"
"this blanket is very soft, warm and beautiful! its a great accessory for any beautiful baby :) i got this as a gift to my niece and her mom loves it"
"my 5-month old niece faith received this from me for christmas.  it is soft as butter, and intrigues our new little addition to the family.  she appears to love it as much as her older sister and brother loved their own 'taggies' when they were little.  it has been reported that she also perceives it to be a good pacifier as well."
bought for my 10 year old grandson for christmas.  i was impressed by the quality in the package upon arrival.  it was his favorite gift on christmas morning.  he started using without instructions and keep busy for hours.  the items are top quality wood and store together in the big box.  it just would be nice to have a way to keep the box closed for storage when not performing.
we love sophie the giraffe. my six month old can't get enough of her - great teether and easy for her to grasp. would definitely recommend this to anyone with kiddos.
"we ordered this swing after the one that we used with our first 3 children broke! we have loved it! the first time we received this package the swing seemed to be defective. however, we contacted amazon and within 48 hours had a new one at our door that has worked perfectly! it was easy to assemble, the material is extremely soft, seems very comfortable for baby, and baby loves looking at herself in the mirror!"
"i've tried several teethers for my a 4-month old, she's ignored every single one of them and continued to be very uncomfortable at times. then i noticed tiny bite marks on her little hands! i found this theether, thanks to all amazon reviewers. this one is just the right shape, size, thickness and texture - she can hold it and turn it the way she wants nicely. she still puts her fists into her mouth, but no bite marks any more - she uses her avent teether for when she needs to bite real hard. the actual colour is a bit warmer than the one in the picture. cute, safe and it really works!"
this lamp looks great in my sons room and matches the rock n roll collection perfectly!  it also give off just the right amount of light.  it's not glaringly bright like the ceiling fan light but it's still bright enough to read him books.  the light is a nice soft light.  coming with its own light bulb is a nice plus too.
"our little fellow has enjoyed this toy greatly.... he especially likes the mirror [super fun for making faces at, crooning to, and mouthing] and the clicking, moveable triangle teethers. he uses this to this day to chew as his teeth slowly emerge."
"i have found this nasal aspirator better than even the hosptial blue one.  i have found the suction is excellent.  i have used it for the past 5.5 years with my 3 children.  the two-piece aspirators don't give enough suction.  this one squeezes well.  i haven't found thickness in mine a problem; it is actually softer than the hospital version, and that's why i feel it's better.  the bonus is the cute-factor, which all my children love.  they are tempted, though, to chew on the trunk!"
good price for under $6 each. also like that one side is waterproof and the other side is fabric (cotton i think). and the size is spot on - not too small and not overly large as to be cumbersome. folds well so you can put it in your diaper bag. haven't needed to wash it yet.
"bought this as a x-mas gift for granddaughter.age 7.  seems to be made well, i really wish it plugged in so it could be used as a night light.  it's really cute.  she loves finding the constellations.  good item.  thanks amazon for great service, as always!"
Excellent quality and safe organic rubber material and most babies love them that actually take a pacifier. Our child won't take any pacifier however. If our child would use pacifiers these would be our first option.
"I thought they were just adorable when I started buying Wubbanubs as gifts for friends. Now that I am a mom myself I can see how GENIUS these are!!!! Since binky's alwaysssss fall out, these animals sit on their chest and prop up the pacifier! So if he yawns it won't fall out. It is also easy to find and he likes to hold on to it and seems to cuddle with it. They are just darling and we LOVE THEM. We just buy more as they get worn out from our wear and tear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and definitely worth every penny!!!!!!!!!"
Adorable.  Arrived promptly.  The parents were very satisfied with them.  The baby girl took to them right away.  She cries if she drops it.  I have to laugh out loud.  Parents are avid Cowboy fans.
"Works great for breastfeeding mothers.  Has a nice cutout for the nose for small babies, great for premies to use.  They're soft, not hard plastic, and helps our baby sleep through the night.  Highly highly recommend!!  Only downside is that it's hard to find these outside of Amazon, though they are starting to sell a variation of it under the First Years brand."
Was a little big when my grandbabies were newborns but they quickly grew into them
"This is the most adorable little creature!  My baby is actually a Nuk fan, but she will take the Soothie from time to time, especially when her sweet lamb is attached!  It has been a great way to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth, and she loves to hold the lamb while it's on her chest.  I'm just so disappointed that the lamb is currently unavailable.  I've searched several times for it for recently born babies, but no luck.  We haven't had any issues with the pacifier falling off, or the lamb getting dirty. I think it would hold up to a good washing, though."
I love that the nose is cutout for infants!!  Soooo smart!!! We always thought the ones from the hospital looked like they were blocking an infants nose!
"These are cute and good quality, but quite heavy. They work for my 9 month old and may be too heavy for a younger baby."
we bought a few of these for our newborn and liked it so much that we bought this one for a friend's new baby
We received a pacifier at the hospital that our son loved and didn't seem to cause nipple confusion. These seem to the same brand and we bought quite a few of them. Our son at 6 months still loves them and now likes to chew on the sides. They are a good size and the baby can handle and hold them well. One thing to note when they fall they are like super balls and settle in the toughest area to reach. It becomes a bit of a game Where did the Pacifier Go?  The packaging says 0 to 6 months and we are now looking for a replacement. I am not sure we really need one though.
"Cute - yes, but I really bought this for me, it helps me keep track of the binky (pacifier).  The colors are bright and our 3 month old is able to grab it and pull the bink to his mouth  all on his own.  I like that it is super lightweight and there are no beads for a possible choking  hazard if a seam opened up.  The wubbanub won't get lost in a seat crevice or hit the floor  and roll under a sofa and it is easily seen even at night.  We spot clean the dragon as needed  and wash the soothie on a regular basis and have had no issues with pilling or fading.  No   regrets on this purchase.  $16.95 and free shipping."
"this is a healthy way to keep baby happy, stress free  and have some freedom to get tasks done with a happy baby!  A great tool for any parents lucky enough to have a baby  who love them!"
"this is a great product. it comes with a cover which is very convenient because you can close the it and it doesn't get dirty. it's also good quality, my newborn loved it. make sure this is the first pacifier you give your baby because they tend to like the first one they got and don't always adapt to new pacifiers later."
Must have for little ones... Great quality and love the Pattern. Easy to find in a bag or purse.  We have several diff patterns.
this toy is amazing. i've never seen a hand boiler before. i bought this for my 10 year old daughter. i think i'll play with it more than she will! it's very educational if you look into how it works. love it.
"purchased to go with a noah's ark nursery.  can't wait to put a photo of our 2 boys in it together.  very nice piece.  sturdily made. heavy (it is metal), but a great buy. definitely adds to the room."
"i first bought this product 2 years ago when my daughter turned 2, she's now 4 and we still use it every day on our home table top.  her twin brothers have now turned 2 and i bought two more of them to use for their place setting as well.  i like it because it keeps plastic plates and bowls from sliding around and possibly falling on the floor.  my daughter's mat is over 2 years old and is strain and rip free.  only thing i don't like about the mat is the suction cups because it makes it hard to put an open cup right on the mat without having a spill.  overall, i really like the mat and we use it every day and it gets washed every day and still works great."
"i recently purchased this gate and installed it in just a couple of minutes.  i don't have kids.  i have a dog and a bird.  dog wanted to go in bird's room and tear up newspaper and scavange around, dragging stuff around the house making a mess.  that had to stop.  so i got this gate to put in the doorway of the bird's room.  the very cool thing, to me anyway (easily entertained), was that i could install it in the door frame and it didn't interrupt use of the door so i could still close his door at night and keep it open during the day, leaving the baby gate there to block the dog from entering.<br /><br />the gate is powder-coated metal and is very sturdy and well made.  it feels secure and strong where i put it.  the gate opens pretty easily.  at first i had to get the feeling of it (push in button and lift a little bit to get it to clear the locked area) and it was a cinch after that.<br /><br />i love that you can push it all the way open (in either direction) and have it stay open when you want it that way.  or, just open it enough to go through it and let it fall closed.  since it can open out into either direction, that makes it more versatile because you can install it with the latch on either side, thereby allowing you to have it open to the left or right.<br /><br />i like it so much that i just ordered another one for my stairwell.  i don't want the dog going upstairs into my office when i'm not there and i've just been blocking the entrance at the top of the stairs with a sheet of styrofoam at night.  looks tacky.  i can put this down near the foot of the stairs and it will look much better, plus i can just leave it swung open during the day.<br /><br />i cannot think of anything i do not like about this gate.  the learning curve in getting it up right was very small.  i also like that you don't have to put screws or nails in the walls if you don't want.  the tension-mount works very well.  it also comes with 2 expansion panels.  i didn't use those with my first one, but will be using them for my stairwell.<br /><br />this is noteworthy - the gate has all straight lines, unlike the main picture they have here on the website currently.  the one with the curved outer bars is not the one that i received.  mine does say model #4910, just like in the description.  but i felt it was noteworthy to advise that this model has all straight bars.  see the variety of pictures they provided and some of them do reflect that.  ***see pictures i have loaded here showing one gate without extensions and the other using both extensions.***for my stairwell.    this is noteworthy - the gate has all straight lines, unlike the main picture they have here on the website currently.  the one with the curved outer bars is not the one that i received.  mine does say model #4910, just like in the description.  but i felt it was noteworthy to advise that this model has all straight bars.  see the variety of pictures they provided and some of them do reflect that.  ***see pictures i have loaded here showing one gate without extensions and the other using both extensions.***"
it's a great idea to use as a self soother instead of a pacifier.  sometimes my son can't find the pacifier in the dark room so he plays with his silkie.  also love that you get two so he always has one when the other is in the wash.
this wrap is amazing! i have two of them so i can keep one in the car and one in the house.  i have been stopped numerous times by strangers who asked where to get this sling and i can't stop raving about it to all of my mommy friends! getting baby in and out of is a breeze and i couldn't be happier about being able to nurse discretely while in public.  i would recommend watching the included dvd as it shows how to position your baby and even shows how you can get twins in it! i can't speak highly enough about this product!
these are great. easy to dispense when you're in a hurry (which is often the case). thinner than some other brands but still strong enough. they do exactly what they are intended to do.
I got these just in time for a wedding. My 15 mon old looked adorable in them! They were a good size and were great!
"My son has never been a diehard binky addict like my older daughter was, but I wanted to try something a little more stylish than the tried & true Soothies we've always used. These were on a special promo & I thought why not. I'm very pleased with them so far (about a week of use). My 4 month loves to grab & he can hold on to the handle  & actually put it back in his mouth (whether intentional or not!). True, the glow in the dark feature doesn't hold for hours & hours, but that's kinda common sense. Truth be told, anything that would retain a bright glow for that long wouldn't be something I'd want to give to my infant anyway!  My son seems to like these quite well for those times when he's in need of a comfort suck & doesn't need a bottle. I like the shape of the nipple & how it's proportionate for his size/age. I'd recommend these.   *Amazon sent me the yellow which is very cute."
"This pacifier is so cute and could make anyone laugh.  I bought it as a shower present for my niece, and there's nothing like getting pictures emailed to you with a sweet baby using this bink.  It's a great little gag gift to include in a present for a new mom, especially if you tease the new mom about Twilight."
"I have used MAM pacifiers with all three of my babies.  I really like that they fit perfectly around their tiny faces, and that they vent, so baby's skin doesn't get irritated.  The only thing I wish was different was the color options when purchasing.  I chose blue, but got green ones.  Not a big deal though.  Also, these pacifiers do not come with any case to store and keep clean, as some other brands do."
"First try I bought her pacifiers, I bought these at the grocery store and ever since she will spit out or throw any other pacifiers, but these. More than half the time she'll go right to sleep when I give her her pacifier or she'll calm down. I don't give a crap about color because its not like my daughter cares right now anyways, as long as these do their job and help my daughter stay calm or go to sleep is ALL I care about."
"I can't see how this gets anything other than a 5-star review.  The product is proportionally well created, with just enough lip to make any baby with a normal sized head/face look hilarious.  The teeth are overly large which makes the caricature that much cuter.<br /><br />This product is perfection from beginning to end."
"This binky is adorable! I paired it with the Disguise - L'Vampire Halloween Costume (12-18 months). My son used it a few times afterwards (mostly playing). It's heavier than a normal paci, so I would recommend it for older babies and toddlers."
We are on our 3 rd one.  My son loves it.  He sleeps with it every night & for naps.  The 1st one he pulled the paci off the dog.  The second we lost.  We are on our 3rd one.  Buy more than one.
"I bought this pacifier cast is a good size and fits 2 Soothies in it!  The hook is perfect to hook onto the outside of your diaper bag.  The case has holes in it to prevent moisture from building up inside if the pacifiers were wet.  The case is BPA free which is another plus.  Looks like it comes in orange and blue, but you can't choose your own color when you order it, you get what they give you.  I received the orange and it's perfect since it stands out on my dark diaper bag."
I can't wait to start using these. Though to be honest they smell super weird. I hope I get used to it... it's really overpowering though Every now and then I think I smell them and they're not even in the room anymore... lol oh well as long as the baby looks cute sucking on them I think I can get over it.
The pacifier shipped right on time and matched my sons costume wonderfully. I was very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend this item .
"Our baby likes to suck on this with someone's finger inside. And now that he's teething, he prefers it to other teething tools. A note of caution: we were dog sitting a 1-yr old dog who sought them out to eat them. Our own dogs aren't interested, but the pup sure was. We had to buy more!"
"i love this monitor! i bought it when my daughter was almost 2 when my monitor broke. i only wish i had it when she was a baby! the picture quality is excellent and the sound quality is also excellent! there is absolutely no interference, no static what-so-ever.   i highly recommend this baby monitor."
my son loves nuk pacifiers. wish finding nipples was as easy as finding a pacifier. i need nuk wideneck 6+ mos medium nipples!!!
"i have purchased many diaper bags, and this will be the last one. i found what i've been looking for, this is perfect it stays upright so it is easy to look for items, and organize them too!"
"anyone reviewing this product saying they don't work is not using them correctly.  they are a dream, and if you have the right size and make sure they cover the cloth completely, they will not leak.  it obviously takes more time in changing, but saving us hundreds, maybe thousands.  we still use disposable in the wee hours of the morning and when we travel, but other than that...<br />after a disposable diaper blow out or two, we have started to use these over disposables when she is in her fine sunday dress!"
we have 4 of these and i wish they came in more gender neutral designs (i have 2 boys). they are the perfect size for both my toddler and my 4 yr old.  i also have the bowls which are great quality.
"the rock'n play sleeper is the best baby sleeper ever! when my grandson was born, a new-mommy friend suggested this item to keep at my house and i am so glad i did.  when my grandson came to visit, he slept soundly in it and, because of the slight elevation, he was able to breathe better.  the sleeper went home with him!  whenever my daughter needs to keep him nearby, the sleeper is lightweight but very sturdy and folds conveniently for travel.  i would recommend this for every newborn."
"it fits wonderfully on my baby trend jogger expedition lx.  i have yet to use it in the rain, but it appears that all important areas are completely covered with plastic and the velcro closes tightly."
"this is without a doubt my daughter's favorite thing in the world. we got her one when she was about 3 months old and she loved it from the start. just playing with those tags can occupy for long periods of time. when she got to be about 5-6 months she started chewing on the tags. we put it over her when we take her for walks or in her infant seat in the car - she never seems to tire of it. the packaging says not to put it in the wash, but i do, and it has held up."
"my daughter who i bought this for isn't due for 2 more months, so we haven't actually used any of this set yet.  i can say that we got it very quickly and that it is as cute as (if not cuter than) the picture.  i plan on painting the room a girly turquoise color that i think will go really well with the colors in the bedding!  as a shopper, i would have liked more pictures to view when purchasing this, but i am very happy with the product we received."
i first bought these for my three month old granddaughter which she loved.  one day when her 9 month old cousin came over for a visit she shared one of her teether with him and he loved it.  so i had to ordered him some. they have other teether but they always come back to these.
"i bought this blanket for my two year old for her cot at school and it is so soft and plush that i want one for myself!  i was afraid it would be thin and small, but it larger than her other blankets and quite thick.  the design is adorable and goes well with many colors.  this is so cute i'm thinking about changing her room decor! and so plush i am looking for more blankets like this one in different patterns."
a gift for a family member who was very pleased the assembly<br />was not complicated. she loves the crimson color because she<br />can pick out her stroller easily when all the black topped ones<br />clutter the hallway-<br /><br />great product!
got this and it goes excellent with the eddie bauer teddy bear bedding set. very stylish good choice and great price
"this is a surprisingly useful little bag.  it attaches to stroller or larger bags.  it keeps my diapers organized and where i can find them as opposed to being jammed here or there.  it's a very good size, not so large as to be bulky, not so small as to not hold enough.  i can fit in around 10 diapers (size six and four), a pack of wipes, and a toss-away changing liner at the max which covers almost any length trip.  the zipper works well after six months of solid use.    i recommend this item."
"have had this installed on my 8 months crib for a few months now, and i can sleep sound at night because of these bumpers. she is such a wild sleeper, but these don't move when she kicks or tries to play with them. great product, they take a little while to get properly installed though."
"this was to convert my gate to go on my banister, and it works like a charm!  feels safe and secure, doesn't slide at all, my son stands on the other side and rattles it and nothing happens. yay!"
my son quickly learned to remove the traditional style plugs.  we placed these in the eye level outlets.  sometimes guests come over and even the adults can't figure out how to take them off.
we've had this book since our son was 4 months old and read it to him daily.  he absolutely loves it!  he's now 8 months old and squeals with pure delight whenever we say \\peek a boo\\ and reveal what's behind the flap.  it's one of the best baby purchases we've made.  i really like that it's cloth so it stands up to a lot of punishment unlike the board books.  it also doesn't have that annoying velcro book closure like some of the other cloth books.
"i just bought this wrap sling and i adore it! i was having a hard time with other slings so i bought this and it's so simple, so comfortable, and my baby loves it! nursing in it is so easy too. the best wrap sling out there!"
my son was breastfed and is very fussy about his nipples on pacifiers and bottles. he loves these!after trying just about every brand i found these! i buy them whenever i see them in a store! they sanitize well too! water never gets inside the nipple. they seem to have a natural fit inside the mouth of a youngster. they come in so many great colors and designs too! he has one to match just about anything he wears! lol
i have two grandchildren (7 & 3) and have had this brand since the oldest was two. through natural wear i had to replace them about six months ago. replaced with another brand that just did not do the job. searched and found the original i had used and working like a charm!
"bought this before my first baby was born, based on reviews and ended up loving it! it's a smooth ride for both baby and i, and definitely can handle a lot.  it's very easy to fold up but can get quite heavy constantly putting it into the trunk of your car and taking it out. i use this not only for walking/jogging but also at malls, parks, etc. i can fit quite a bit into this except for my diaper bag which can become annoying b/c the bottom storage is so small.  however, i just take out the essentials from the diaper bag and place them into the back pockets of the stroller.  reclines almost flat for baby to sleep, canopy has great coverage and good size window, amazing brakes and hand brakes, etc.    my only complaint would be the weight (which is expected i suppose) and the lack of space for a diaper bag, a small diaper bag.    otherwise, perfect for our family."
"really nice walker, very comfortable for any baby! the colors are very nice! the front tires turn but the back ones don't, maybe it would be even more fun for the baby if the back ones turned also. anyway this is a great walker and my daughter has alot of fun with it!"
"i bought it in the silver lavender which is no longer an available color.  it works great as a bag for taking my books, lunch, and other items to classes with me and doubles as an oversized purse.  it has pockets for my cell phone, credit cards, checkbook, and cash.  i can fit quite a bit of stuff in it and my classmates have said to me, \\where did you get it?  i want one!\\  their jaws drop when i tell them it was sold as a diaper bag.... they say they'd never know it.  it looks classy and could double easily as a woman's briefcase which is basically what i use it for... a purse/briefcase.  my cats seem to leave it alone... they have not tried to shred it so that is pleasing too.  i recommend it highly."
"this walker is exactly what we were looking for. bright colors, plenty of things to keep baby busy. the little play station is removable,(not by baby), to reveal a tray for snacks, etc. it has adjustable heigth so it will grow with your baby. our 5 month old granddaughter's feet could touch the ground on the lowest setting. she was able to move it within minutes. backwards, but hey, she moved it. it moves easy but i can see, with the brake pads, it will have a problem on plush carpet. we don't have this problem due to low pile carpet and hard wood floors. i think those pads are there as extra insurance against tip-over. although the unit seems pretty sure footed to me. i'm sure, with a little enginunity, the plush carpet issue can be handled. it folds down to a reasonably small size for travel. i need to mention a couple of things that will help. first, read the instructions. they're easy to read and will help you. check twice before installing the cloth seat. i put it on inside out the first time. and the little rings that hold the seat in place are difficult to get seated in. you will have to tug pretty hard but they will go in place. the little brake pads, you will know what i'm talking about when you get to them. they fit very tight but must be completely seated of they will not let the walker move. i ended up using a rubber mallet to lightly tap them in. don't get carried away. all you need is a light tap or two. this is a great little walker, your baby will love it. one more thing, don't worry if your baby's feet wont touch the ground while sitting. he or she will soon learn to scoot forward and stand. enjoy!"
"sooo cute, plenty of room, and my kids love to use them!!!  the little details of the ears and trunk are super cute and, most importantly it keeps food cold!"
This pad fits perfectly in my Graco pack-n-play. We take it on road trips so the pack-n-play is a lot softer for our baby to sleep in.  It goes great with the American Baby Waterproof Fitted Quilted Mattress Pad.
Used this passy for both kids...and both loved them!  I love the fact that they have space for nose...Always hated that the soothie passy given to me at the hospital covered the nose.  Only issue I had with this passy was with my first son...the inside piece broke after being steped on and punctured the outside of passy...allowing water to get inside and mildew!  After I ordered this...I found out that they are now being sold at Walmart...with my first baby...I was only able to find them on-line.  Friend got me the first one!
"I never knew these existed until I came across a baby message board & everyone was recommending them. My baby couldn't keep a regular pacifier in his mouth, they kept falling out. This was the BEST solution. Soft for them to hold onto & the perfect weight to rest on their chest while they're sleeping. Love that they're washable (no dryer, air dry). His has been bathed several times."
This is great for bedtime because ithe elephant can be made to sit so it stays in my daughters mouth better. It's very cute too!
"as new parents we purchased this video monitor on amazon in early 2010. the audio/video quality was very good (too sharp you can even hear the slightest noise made by the baby). the frequency range is excellent too. one time i had to go down to pick up something from the car and my baby was sleeping in the 3rd floor and so i took the monitor with me. being in the ground floor i was still able to watch my baby sleep with no difficulties in the video/audio. i would have given it 5 stars then, but i forgot to write the review. one day i accidently dropped the monitor into the bath tub and i freaked out!!!!!!!!! i immediately removed the batteries, wiped out clean and let it dry in the sun for a few hours. i checked the monitor to see if it was working and it still worked great with the same excellent quality!!!!!!!! i never really thought it would work and i was already cursing myself for the mistake i did. this happened in june 2011 and now even after 6 months, its workin fine. i decided its definitely time to write a good review and here it is! we still use it everyday and its definitely one of the best purchases we've made. best video monitor!!!"
my daughter has loved this swing since she was born (1 month old today).  we use it everyday!  i love that you can turn it in 3 different directions too.  the base is about 3 feet wide so you have to have an area large enough for it to fit.  would recommend.
"my son, who is 10 months old, immediately knows how to use it. he never likes/cares any of teething toys, i bought about 10 different shape teething toys, i bought for him.therefore, i was a little bit worry that he will not like this training toothbrush. after read all the reviews, i decided to give it a shot. he just loves it at the very 1st time i gave to him. the brush is soft enough for his baby gum and the handles were so easy for him to grape and bend.actually, i am thinking to get another one just in case we lose this one.i will defiantly recommend this product to all my friends."
"i love this diaper bag, it is a generous size and fits all my baby's essentials.  the pattern is beautiful and the colors are just as pictured.  this bag is very sturdy and well made, the only thing i noticed was that there was a bit of foam sticking out of the stitching on the changing pad. no biggie, i trimmed it off and it looks good--it serves it purpose.  the smaller bag that came with it is an excellent size also. i got the idea from another review and had my daughters name embroidered on it.  it looks like nothing else i had seen in local stores and i get compliments on it all the time.  this is a great buy and they have so many different patterns and colors to choose from that i'm going to order another.  i would definitely recommend this product."
"this is one awesome toy at an awesome price.its a great alternative to the $40 bar you have to buy seperately for the bjourn babysitter balance.as you know by now,it fits on almost any seat.i use mine on her swing,toddler chair,carseat and bjourn.its flexible so that it can be adjusted to sit wider or higher.it can be adjusted to tilt forward or back.this is due to the ball joints.it seems durable and is secure.my baby loves it.  that said,the toys could be better quality.they are lightweight and have crinkle paper inside that babies love.the vecro is a joke.a baby will rip them off with less than moderate force.the ball for the fan is the only toy that is fixed.  they should have used heavy duty velcro and more of it.  the good thing is the toys can be replaced with ones you already have.it has loops.  id definately buy again and highly recommend."
"on nov 19, 2011, we had a major accident. my truck (2006 dodge ram 1500) slid on ice and went off the road. the truck ramped a driveway in the middle of the ditch, and rolled twice before landing upright. other than being a little upset, my 3 yr old was completely fine. no concussion, bruises, whiplash, absolutely nothing. considering my truck was a \\total loss\\ according to insurance, that none of us were seriously injured is a miracle. i am forever grateful that i bought this car seat, and am using the replacement money to purchase again."
love the swaddle me products!  these organic cotton swaddle me's are silky soft and the velcro really sticks well!  highly recommend this product!
"I ordered this mattress to go in a portable crib that I purchased from a daycare.  It has a snug fit, as it should, and seems very comfortable.  I am very happy with this purchase!"
I bought this for my mom for her birthday. I just received it and I love it. It's very clean and the cutest little sheep. I will update this when my mom opens it and tell what she thinks as well.
"great price for two bags, one is very small, used to hold two or three pacis, i use mine to hold eye drops, chapstick, tissues, wet naps, and glucose tabs. the large one isn't something i'd use to hold a whole days worth of dirty diapers but when i'm out of town for then evening it can hold 4 maybe 5 if i roll them up (prefolds and insert together) well. and it keeps the smell in very well too! wish it did zipper instead of tie though.<br /><br />edit after a year of use I still use this product, I lost the smaller bag a while ago, but still use the large one, it did tear at the seam where the ties are, and i have yet to fix it, but use it none the less! keeps the stink in very well!"
"We had a Britax in Europe, so I decided to buy another one for the US. My daughter loves this seat and seems to be really comfortable in it. I read some reviews saying installation was difficult but I didn't find that to be true at all. I've used it both with the seatbelt and latch system and both were fairly easy to do."
"I bought this crib tent when my two year old started trying to get out of her crib.  Once she knew she could do it, bedtime became a nightmare.  I didn't think she was mature enough to stay in a toddler bed.  And I was having a terrible time sleeping myself worrying that she would get out of her crib and would have free rein in the house.  I was concerned by some of the reviews saying it was poorly constructed, but I was desperate.  I have to say I love it!  My daughter things it's great when I put her in it, she'll even lift the flap for me to zip it sometimes.  She fusses when it's time to lay down.  But that's the same with the tent or without.  She seems to fall asleep more quickly with the tent.  I'm guessing that's partly because she can't throw her comfort items (blanket, lovey and seahorse) out, and partly because she knows she really doesn't have another option.  Instead of trying to get out of the crib, she just lays down.  I will agree the instructions could be better.  It took me longer than I would have liked to put it together. As for those with the zipper troubles, I almost wonder if they had the velcro too tight.  I know the first couple of times I zipped and unzipped it, I was really concerned. (It was like zipping up luggage that was too full.) But when I loosened the velcro holding it to the front rail, the zipper action was much smoother.  I have only had it for 6 weeks.  So I can not speak to it's long term durability.  But so far I am pleased.  The biggest cons I have with this crib tent would be that the zipper is loud.  I usually take out her musical seahorse, and cover her up before I go to bed.  I try to be as quiet as I can, but it sometimes makes her stir.  Thankfully it hasn't woken her up yet.  The other con is using it with a video baby monitor. The mesh makes it hard for the monitor camera to see in the crib.  I had to move the camera several times before finding somewhere that gave me a reasonable view.  For us, the pros of this product far outweigh the cons. Sleep is a precious commodity at our house. It was worth every penny we paid for this crib tent for her to get better sleep, thereby allowing me to get better sleep."
"Why are people giving this dresser a bad review?  I ordered this dresser over a year ago for myself (not a child) because of the price (I'm on a tight budget). I wasn't really sure what to expect when I ordered it considering the low price (my old dresser had cost almost as much as this dresser and had been made of very cheap materials) so I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  The dresser wasn't difficult to assemble. It's very nice looking (my old dresser looked cheap), it's very sturdy (my old dresser wasn't), and the drawers have plenty of space for my clothes (socks, underwear, pajamas, t-shirts, light sweaters)."
"There is no music as stated in the title.  On the plus side, that means no batteries to replace.  I absolutely love this toy!  It is flexible and adjustable and hooks to just about anything.  I have used it on the swing, bouncy seat, bassinet and car seat and will use it on the stroller and high chair soon.  It is easy to attach-- hook on the claws and turn the knobs to tighten.  It has a lot of joints in it so you can tilt it forward or back, make it flatter or taller.  That way, it is always in the perfect position for baby to reach.  The toys that hang down are removable.  The sun is really cute and my baby loves to stare at it.  All in all, a great toy for a good price!"
I have never put up wall paper before so I was a little nervous. The wall paper was easier than I thought.  Just use a lot of water and it will come out fine. It took us a little less than an hour to put up the border all around our nursery.  It looks great and matches the crib set and valances perfectly. I would highly recommend to everyone.
This is the second spout guard I purchased.  The first was hard plastic and kept falling off the spout totally defeating the purpose of buying it in the first place. This one is so much better.  It fits very snug creating a very safe spout.  My 22 month old granddaughter loves to play with the water flowing from the spout and now I don't have to worry about her hitting her head.  I am completely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone interested in creating a safe environment for little ones.
"Comfortable, soft material with nice padding on the sides. Pretty design. Best of all the safety features with side impact give peace of mind. Excellent quality overall."
"My husband and I bought this for our 2 month old who has been having problems going to sleep at night and seems to hate the dark. After sleeping with a light or tv on we wanted to get some type of night light. I was weary of this since it doesn't play music and it looked kind of generic to me. However this is the best thing we've bought our son yet. The first time turning it on, his eyes lit up and he got really excited. We use it every night now and turn it back on during our middle of the night feedings. He immediately looks up in awe and starts to get sleepy again. I've put this on a shelf, on the floor, and even in his bassinet when he wasn't in it and it's always worked perfectly. For the amber glow to work you need a very dark room, but hey that's what the middle of the night is. The amber glow also seems to be the most calming and puts him to sleep quickly. Worth every penny! Highly recommend for infants who are fussy about going to sleep at night."
"So far this video monitoring system has performed above my expectations.  After reading some of the other reviews I was worried.  Yes, the movement alarm will sound every other second when you first turn it on.. there's a dial on the camera labelled sensitivity that needs to be adjusted properly (or disabled) before you use the system.  The only thing that surprised me, but in retrospect shouldn't have, was that in order to use Skype you have to have the video monitor attached to a PC.  I didn't read that anywhere before purchasing, but it makes sense.  It's pretty cool that the monitor acts as a wireless video camera for chatting.  It shows up as a normal webcam.  The temperature does read as warmer than it should, but this can be taken into consideration when setting temperature-based alarms.  For me it's not anywhere near the 10 degrees off that others reported."
"These blankets came in so handy for swaddling our baby during the first month or so. After buying this set, we received an aden + anais set made with bamboo. I highly recommend the bamboo ones. They are SO much softer!"
This is the only pacifier we could find for my son that he could keep in his mouth! Great product.
This is my second beco. I had a butterfly2 but i didnt like all of the buckles. I love this one and so does my baby. The pattern is super cute and i get lots of compliments on it. its nicely padded everywhere.
Baby Aspen Sweet Pea 5-pc layette was adorable and was received as promised...overnight delivery!I needed it as a Baby Shower Gift the next day and the Mommy-to-be just loved it. Great presentation in the gift basket as well!
"Quality: yes. Good for both mom & dad: yes. Holds enough for newborn & infant? Yes. Adjustable strap is great, number of pockets are great. Please note things put in pocket and decrease the amount of rom on the inside (just as most things with pockets do)."
"NOTE: These are not big enough to cover entire windows, just a good amount. 13 x 20 sheets  These aren't window tinting, but they are. This is a staticly clung to your window Tint. I just got done installing this and have found that I could play with it seven hundred times to get it perfect, and it was still clinging to the window.   These come packed into a box the size of a cig pack. First thing, take them out and lay them flat in the sun, at night put a bunch of weight on top of them. I put these in the back windows and those were already tinted, and these just add to the darkness. They are easy to cut, easy to work, I used my hand a lot and a credit card. I had no problems, just went from one side to the other. I will update if I have any faults... but for now, Its a great item to cover light from the kids!  UPDATE: Today, Jan 2nd, they are still in place, holding strong. A few air bubbles showed up, but with fingers, they are taken out. Im going to buy another pack, I want to add to the back windows of my SUV.   Good Luck"
"I had a preemie and was terrified of sids. I couldn't use the angel care monitor becuase our daughter was sleeping in a bassinnet in our room. This was the perfect solution. I slept so much better once I had this. Once she got bigger and kicked and rolled more, it would pop off and alarm, but a few false alarms are a small price to pay for peace of mind.  She never seemed to notice it. It doesn't emit or receive radio signals, so you don't need to worry about radiation.   BUY IT - worth every penny."
"Recently bought a second bag. No worries, the first one is still going strong - our family has grown and we needed another bag and based on our experience with this car seat travel bag, we did not even hesitate buying one more.   First of all, the material is much thicker and stronger than I originally expected. It holds up well and is easy to wipe clean. The straps are nice and strong, and my husband swears they are comfortable too - he does most of the hauling. It sits well on your back (just the right spot) on an average height person but even a petite woman like me can't complain and I'm barely 5 feet tall.   We were trying to choose between a bag with straps vs. bag with wheels and are really glad we went with straps. We don't use backpacks when travelling so it is very convenient to throw this on your back so your hands are free to pull suitcases, push a stroller or carry a cranky toddler!"
the stars look great on the ceiling and they form constellations. It comes with a guide to the constellations as well as a story book . This is an awesome little nightlight.
This is a great pacifier for a newborn. This was the pacifier that they were using in the neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital and our baby loves it.
"seems good, looks cute, waiting for the baby to arrive to try it out.  Love the skull on it.  Its Gerber Goth"
"i am 25 weeks pregnant and i love this product. great pillow. very comfy, i couldn't do without it. would definitely recommend."
"the level two nipples for dr. brown's wide neck bottles are just another step in progressing my child's development.  i am quite satisfied with the product, and i know others will be too."
excellent product from avent. worth the money. it works perfectly for avent feeding bottles. fits most of the microwaves. its easy to use and would recommend this product.
"when our little one was born, we set up a pack n play in our room for her to sleep in. unfortunately, she was a picky sleeper and would scream nearly the instant we would put her down. we would then walk over, put a hand on her for a few minutes before she would fall back asleep. and then she would do that over and over again all night. this co-sleeper really saved the day. it was a bit of a pain to put together. we have a queen size bed and the adjustment mechanism is in-between the mattress and the box spring, so we had to adjust the straps, lower the mattress, lift the mattress and readjust the straps, over and over again until it was perfect. a slight redesign to put the adjustment mechanism at either end would make set up much easier.   however, once it was set up, it was fantastic. when she would fuss, i could just put my hand on her. when she lost her pacifier, i could quickly reinsert it. when it was time to breast feed, i could just pick her up. when she was done, i could gently put her down. the co-sleeper made life much better by allowing us to actually sleep without getting out of bed all night to check on our little one. we only really used the co-sleeper for 2 months until she was ready for her pack n play, but our sanity and sleep was completely worth the price of the co-sleeper."
"this is shorter then what they say,i read the other people reviews when buying so it was great for my 45 year old bassinet. my daughter has been sleeping on it roughly 3 weeks now and its doing fine it wipes clean very easy and sheets fit it well given that it is a little to short, i would so buy it again if i needed to."
"This is the style they give babies at the hospital. It fits small babies. The other ones almost cover their faces. Most of us are worried that they will get hooked on the pacifier. When they are just born, they will either go for the pacfier, or their thumb. I prefer the pacifier which I can remove once I want it."
"Unlike most pacifiers on the market, that are listed as 0-3 months...these are actually made for newborns. They are better than any of the other pacis that are more expensive.The nipple on these are smaller and easier for them to attach to. The pacifier is hollow in the middle so they can actually suck the pacifier and keep it in their mouth without you holding it the whole time. The work great in steamer or the dishwasher to sanitize. This is truly a MUST purchase, regardless of you like pacifiers or not...a great back up plan!"
good product that was described accurately.  this was a present to my husband the bears fan of the house.  fun to see in baby girl's mouth!!
Babies love this bear.. they make great baby shower gifts..a very nice first teddy bear will last for years to come
I cannot stand the soothie pacifier because they hide my daughters gorgeous face. I have tried so many others and this is the only one that my daughter will take besides the gumdrop and soothie. I think it is because the nipple is soft like the soothie. Cute colors and great price. So happyl I tried these pacifiers
I love this thing! It keeps my son's paci clean while it is sitting in my diaper bag :) I would recommend this to any mommy who has a paci baby!
"My first baby was a NICU child (290 days) so by the time he came home he was hooked on the GumDrop pacifier offered to him in NICU, which we then had to have imported as they're not available over the counter in Australia. Our son loved this pacifier and it suited all our purposes. It was easy to clean, hard wearing, and was awesome during teething as I'd just put it in the freezer, making it nice and cold in his mouth during the many bouts of teething. Our next child was born 4 months ago and I ordered the Gumdrop pacifier for her. SHe has a range of pacifiers in her crib, but ultimately her all time favourite is the GumDrop pacifier. Love this product and highly recommend it to all!"
I absoluteness love this item wubbanubs are the best. I got my daughter hers back in 07 and she used it everyday. This purchase is for a friend and I can not wait to give it to her. The shipping was fast also!!!
"Our daughter came home from the hospital with 2 binkies, and they made life great, till she stopped taking one for about a month and a half.  We tried them again in frustration, but as she was closer to the 6 month range, we tried a mam style i had, and she loves them, and doesn't sleep without it! Shes is a much calmer baby with Binkies!"
My son doesn't always love the pacifier but when he get wound up this calms him down when he feels the need to suck.
I bought this lion and the puppy when my son was 4 months old and he started teething. He loves it and I love it too! I have received a compliments on how cool the product is and I tell other moms to check it out at Amazon.com =)
my wife and i are getting on in years and self balance isn't what it used to be.  i have two of these handles mounted on the shower wall. they grip great and helps one to steady themselves while showering.  i would recommend them for young and old alike for safety sake.
this is an absolute potty training must have! our toddler has just begun the potty training process and had been doing well at home. the only problem we had was when we were out an about. this solved the problem! now we have to make sure it stays in the vehicle! the product is nicely constructed and the handle allows our toddler to carry it to the vehicle.
my husband wanted to put our kids in a booster since they have outgrown their current carseats while in their winter coats - we can't buckle the seats without crushing them. i refused and was so passionate about keeping them in a 5 point harness that i wound up yelling at him with tears for all the little kids who have lost their lives while being in a booster. our kids are 5.5 years old and small. they are about 33 lbs. and 40 inches so lean but too tall now for the toddler seats. thank you to all the families who have shared their stories and helped educate the rest of us. and thank you britax for making this amazing car seat.
"i was so hesitant in ordering these seats, but i am so glad i did.  the other reviews said how helpful they were for bathing more than one small child at once.  i was worried my boys wouldn't like them and would feel restrained.  i couldn't have been more wrong.  they love them!  they are now one and have been using them for over 6 months.  i went with this design since it has the slanted front that allows the boys to lean comfortably to splash or reach for toys.  the seats do float up or move pretty easily when you try to put them in since they only have suctions cups and we have a textured surface on our bathtub.  this is not an issue since they are always supervised. we would not be able to give them baths at the same time so easily any other way.  they were also great for the summer time.  we took them to the beach house in the summer and they doubled as safety seats in the plastic swimming pool when there were not enough hands to hold both.  they probably could even be used as feeding chairs when traveling if need be.  our boys will be out of them soon once they figure out how to try to get out of them and stand up in the tub.  we have gotten so much use out of them and they are easy to clean and hang dry."
"this gate does the job well.  my 1-yr old daughter even shakes it from time to time and it hasn't budged yet!  it can easily be opened with one hand and slides open and/or swings open.  the only bad thing so far is the wood/finish is rubbing off at the top and bottom of the gate where it latches, not horrible but it is noticeable.  the price was very reasonable too.<br /><br />update 4/2016:  we are still using this gate for child #3.  we took it down a few times in between kids. it was very easy to remove and then put back up again.  continues to slides open and closed easily.  the latch is a little difficult to use at first but that also prevents other children from opening the gate for babies/toddlers.  my 5.5 year old daughter is able to open the latch but my 3.5 y.o. son cannot open."
"i really liked these. i was skeptical at first because, when i first pulled them out of the package, they were almost as thin as bed sheets. after about 5 washes they quilted nicely. i would recommend them to anyone! and i am a first time mom, first time cloth diapering, first time using prefolds."
i bought these for my 10-month-old and am very happy with them. they hold just the right amount of food and it doesn't spill off the sides. perfect size. nice to hold and work with. easy to clean. they are my favorite spoons so far.
"love this drying rack. it's adorable, uses very little space, spins to stack baby bottles and such, and it's also very affordable. it is one of my favorite baby items. everytime i use it, i think about how happy i am that i have purchased it."
"after my first pregnancy plagued me with many sleepless nights, and achy hips and backs, i decided i needed to try a body pillow, despite my hesitancy to fork out 50 bucks for a pillow.  but i am so glad i splurged.  i began using this in my first trimester, and slept like a baby right up through delivery.  i never had a problem with achy hips or back and was always comfortable, despite gaining more weight with this pregnancy too!  the pillow is big though, and might make your sleeping partner uncomfortable if you have a small bed, but for my california king, there was still room for my 1 year old to sleep with us too! :)  if you value comfort and high quality sleep despite all the discomforts of pregnancy, i highly recommend this body pillow."
"i purchased this item for my little guy just yesterday and love it.  it is so super easy to use.  other portable, table top highchairs are not so easy to use in my experience.  plus, it is very sturdy and made well.  i am very happy with this purchase!"
we have 5 kids.  we have tried about every snack cup out there.  this one is our favorite.  it keeps the snacks in the cup and off the floor.  now if my wife would just use them at the house...hope she doesn't read that.  :)
"bought this for our son, who has the habit of kicking away his blanket with surprising precision - a problem when temperature falls in the house during this time of the year.<br />while it is, of course, entirely random whether a child will accept a sleeping bag (or wearable blanket), we lucked out and he did not reject it. in fact, he likes it and gets unhappy when you remove it in the morning.<br /><br />the product 100% cotton as advertised, easily washable and doesn't get too hot. the zippers work without getting stuck.<br /><br />short: product works. baby happy, parents happy."
"when my two year old got to long for her toddler bed we went and ordered the metal bed rails that slide under the mattress that was a disaster !!!!!! we then started looking at this product and decided to give it a try . we are sooo glad we did !!!!!! this in an absolute amazing product nooo metal bars , no worrying about your child falling between the matress and the bed rail, and sooo easy to make the bed. the only thing i would caution people on is to make sure your sheets are very tight, we put ours on under her matress protector and my 210pd. husband can move all around and they will not move!!!!!! sum up-great product highly recommend !!!"
"i ordered this after one of my boys started chewing on his crib rail.  with the new design of cribs, this is a must.  i wish i would have had these earlier, but i did not think of them.  they would make a good shower gift.  the only flaw is that the corners are not covered and that is where my boys chew.  it is hard to protect the entire crib from chewers.  i am happy though that it is limiting the chewing to the side rails at the exposed corners, since these will not be part of the full bed when they are older.  there is only one bite mark on the front rail since i did not get these in time before the first bite.  i now know better.  with 2 cribs to try to preserve, these are worth the price.  my boys like to chew on them and the thick padding protects the wood.  it also provides cushion for their heads."
"i would've loved to have had one of these when i was little; i'm sure it would've helped me with my huge fear of the dark back then.<br /><br />basically, this precious turtle transforms the plain dark into a starry night. these are like cut-out stars, not little dots like a planetarium. not sure it offers much educational value, but it sure is a treasure to look at."
this walker is light weight and folds down easily for storage.  it was perfect for my grandson who wasn't quite sitting up yet. provided back   support and is entertaining to him.
nicely made.  its warm and cozy.  my daughter loves it.  probably going to end up with another one shortly.  highly recommend it during winter.
"for the price, this lunchbag is worth it.  its cute, fun and your child will love it.  holds just the right amount of food for a child."
this is a very quality item and i am sooo happy i ordered it. we have a play yard that has the top part turn into a basinet for baby to sleep in. obviously it came with just a plain cover and i couldn't imagine having a baby sleep on that...so we ordered this and it's sooooooo soft and kind of thick so it gives a little padding for baby. highly recommend. i ordered the pink and it's perfect!
"i purchased this in oct. 2009 when i was beginning to pt my son.  i had used a potty chair with my daughter and hated cleaning it.  this was perfect for my little boy to begin using the potty.  now two years later he still uses it to poop.  he is almost 4 and stands to pee, but puts this on all by himself when he has to poop.  it is still great, despite my initial thoughts that it seemed flimsy and wouldn't last.  it has lasted 2 plus years and still works like day one.  it fits fine on our elongated toilet both with seat up or down.  and the only drawback was that when he was learning to pee sitting down, sometimes it would leak out underneath if he didn't point down enough.  not a huge deal, but that was the one downside.  other than that this has been a great seat!!!"
my granddaughter is teething.  my daughter-in-law likes jewelry.  this is a perfect match for them.  i bought both the bracelet and the necklace.  biggest problem my granddaughter has is deciding which one to put in her mouth!  the biggest problem i had was deciding which color to get.
"this memory book is a 3 ring binder, which allows you to add more pages. it comes with quite a few pages that are so adorable! theres pages for family tree, all about mommy and daddy, baby shower, sonogram photo area, pages for firsts and favorites,  not to mention birthdays 1-5 years and more! it's also a lot prettier in person than the picture, and all the pages are very pretty. i highly recommend this if you are looking for an all in one type album. its a memory album, scrapbook, and photo album in one!"
"our little guy was getting too tall for his infant seat, so we decided to upgrade him to a convertible one at 7 months. after reading tons of reviews and doing tons of research i found this one to be affordable, safe and have a smaller profile than some of the others. it seems comfortable for our boy, it spot cleans great, and was easy to install. if you're a little ocd, doing hours of research like i did, search no longer, and get this one :-)"
"this bottle warmer works great. i love the fact that it is very easy to operate, warms bottle very fast and evenly. i also like the fact that you can sanitize pacifiers. it doesnt really take much time to do"
"i really like these. after previously using the thirsties hemp inserts, we decided to try these babykicks when we needed to up our stash of hemp. we love these. not only do they absorb more, in volume, that the thirsties brand, but they are thinner and dry faster. our little one is only 12 weeks old, and the small is the perfect size insert for her pocket diapers. as she grows, we can always still use it as a doubler."
this is a great deal on a time-saving product for babies who love to be swaddled!  we just discovered the swaddleme blanket for our 10 week old and only wish we had found it sooner.  the blanket allows you to tightly and easily swaddle the baby's arms with a soft velcro closure and let baby's legs be looser and comfortable.  we got three of these for $15.99 which is a steal considering we paid $12.99 for just one of these blankets last week at babies r us.  this is a must have for infants!!
"i needed a gift for my niece who is expecting twin girls.  these soft little dolls will be perfect crib-mates for the new babies.  very soft, colorful, and just the right size.  very happy with these dolls!"
"we bought this bed for our second child. i don't think she's old enough to appreciate it yet, but the bed pleases us. it is surprisingly well built, the paint doesn't come off so easily like our first child's bed. (i tried to peel back a small section on the underside) all in all it is a well crafted bed. it's rigid and sturdy. the colour is true to the photo in the listing. we're pleased with it."
"i never thought i'd like a velcro cloth diaper so much. it actually works really well. my baby couldn't really fit into it until she was just over 10 lbs, but once she did, it's our easiest diaper to use. the velcro is soft and has held up well in the wash. i've heard horror stories about velcro in other brands of cloth diapers, but this brand seems to have gotten it right. this diaper is probably the best for when you have someone else watching your baby (like a grandparent or something), because the velcro makes it easy for people who aren't used to using cloth diapers. i also love all the cute designs these come in and really like how this is an aio diaper with a pocket, so you can always stick another insert in there for extra-extra absorbancy(overnight maybe, or for heavy wetters), but otherwise, it's just fine on its own."
"my daughter absolutely loved this blanket.  once you get past how to wrap them in it, you will never let it go and panic when it is in the wash.  she would sleep so much better wrapped in this blanket.  grandma who is old school thought this was amazing.  we called her the little burrito but it worked perfectly.  after she outgrew it, she still slept with it as a blanket.  every parent should be issued one of these when their baby is born along with the baby 411 books.  two of the best products i came across and were invaluable to me."
bought these for our 9 month old when she starting cruising to keep her from bonking her head on the sharp corners of our wooden coffee table. these are great! easy to put on and stay put. they provide nice padding. a smart buy.
"I ordered the Cutsie Caterpillar wubbanub for my daughter with hopes it would help keep the soothie in her mouth for longer than 2 seconds - and it did!! At 6-weeks old, she was able to wrap her arm around her bug, which helped keep the soothie in her mouth. This meant longer spurts of sleeping for her and me. She's now 5-months old and absolutely loves her bug. She's never far from it and can put it in her mouth all by herself. She'd be devastated if anything happened to it, so just ordered another one for back-up.<br /><br />At first I was concerned about keeping the plush part clean since it doesn't separate from the soothie, but it's a non-issue. The wubbanub washes very easily in the washing machine and air dries quickly. I just zip it inside a boppy slipcover before putting it in the wash so it doesn't get beat up by the machine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any parent who is frustrated when their baby's soothie keeps falling out of their mouth. Not only did it help our daughter keep it in her mouth, it gave her something to bond with as she falls asleep or needs comfort."
I am a very clean person and with my husband and I's first child I wanted to make sure that the baby's pacifier stayed clean. This is a great idea!
"We love this paci! it's not thick and has a very nice design. It's surely different than the other ones available on the market. It's worth the price, because it doesn't suck the air around his mouth.  The only con it has, is it retains water whenever i sterlize it so you need to make sure to remove it before you give it back to your LO."
"I love these pacifiers.  They are cute and functional.  My baby can put in her mouth.  While in the car, if it falls out of her mouth it does not roll away from her like other pacifiers, she just pops it back in her mouth.  When she doesn't want to suck on the pacifier part she plays with the stuffed animal.  Great item!"
It's sooo cute and my daughter loves it! It's super soft and she likes to hold on to it. I would recommend this product for anybody who has a baby!
"Our son loves this thing! It really has helped him grab on and hold things better and quicker. He is able to actually play with it and get it back in his mouth at 3 months old. Esp like the monkey. It is super soft and washes nicely. We have the elephant too, but do not prefer the material on it."
"This is the only pacifier my baby would use. He liked the Soothie one from the hospital (big circle one), but these were even better because they had the butterfly shape and a little hole in the handle to attach a clip. The colors are also very nice."
"We really like these pacifiers. We've found that these are the only ones our daughter will take, won't even take the Soothie brand even though the nipple shape is the same. We've been getting good use out of them so far. I've found that boiling them does change the color a little - makes them a tad lighter, but it doesn't have any effect on their performance and structure."
I have yet to find a pacifier that my baby doesn't get board with. It's light weight  and if it's not in her mouth then  it's right by her side. My 4 month old loves it.
"My first born used these and we loved them. One solid piece that you don't need to worry about breaking apart. We tried the round pacifier similar to this, but it was not good. It was heavy and would fall out of his mouth when he was about to sleep, waking him up. The gum drop pacifier fit his face and is light weight. They even make a vanilla flavored one. Love gum drop pacifiers."
"Bought these to tote along our son's NUK pacifiers.  We can fit this on the skinniest part of the Chicco carseat handle so it's always there when baby boy gets fussy and wants his paci.  This container has holes for ventilation.  It easily fits two or three of the NUK pacifiers.  We've been using this container on a daily basis for 4+ months and its held up very well.  Being plastic its also very easy to clean very well, unlike those fabric paci holders that I also considered.  If your baby uses a NUK pacificer, you should definitely check this case out.  ---updated 1/11/12.  Bought a 2nd case to keep in my car, so that we'll always have a clean, safe way to keep our baby's pacifier handy."
Wubbanubs are great and I love the Mary Meyer collection! I've purchased these as gifts for several of my friends and they love them too! My friends say that it is easier to find and harder to lose and they have had no safety concerns with the pacifier. It's a great gift!
Wubbanubs are great and I love the Mary Meyer collection! I've purchased these as gifts for several of my friends and they love them too! My friends say that it is easier to find and harder to lose and they have had no safety concerns with the pacifier. It's a great gift!
The only pacifier my baby girl will take! I live on a base overseas and these pacifiers are so hard to come by and sell out quickly where I am. I had to resort to ordering online cause they never have them! Great quality and no plastic pieces! These are the only pacifiers I will ever buy.
"With my first son I used regular pacifiers. With my second, I found Wubbanub and I have bought at least 5 so far, as once in a while we loose one. I love Wubbanub as my baby can find it in his crib at night much easier, he loves it also as a favorite teddy bear, and because the wubbanub is heavier it is harder to walk around the house with it, decreasing the chances of addiction to having a pacifier all the time in the mouth. My baby uses mostly to go to sleep, in the car or in the stroller. And I think that it will be much easier to break the habit in the future. Maybe I will just cut off the pacifier and he can keep the bear, giving him something to hold to."
"This was exactly what I was looking for when I was looking for a pacifier holder. I also like that it clips on to the outside of bags, so it's easy to access when you have a screaming baby. Also fits 2 binks!"
"We've tried a number of pacifiers, and these are, by far, the best.  We really like that they glow in the dark, and thus can be easily found in the middle of the night."
my son loves his wubbanub. it helps keep the pacifier in their mouth when they are nb and when they get older its easier for them to find and put in their mouth!
"Before coming across this pacifier, we had tried 3 different kinds of pacifiers and neither one of our 2 babies liked them. Finally Natursutten saved us... :-)"
"I ordered the elephant Wubbanub first. I loved it and so did my daughter. She was about 6 weeks old when I got it, and it really helped her keep the paci in her mouth. It would rest on her belly and give that extra support to keep it there. Unfortunately, my dog chewed it up. I loved the product so much that I immediately came on here to order a new one. The elephant was gone, so I chose the caterpillar. Great choice! I think it helps keep the paci in her mouth even better than the elephant. My daughter is now almost 8 weeks old, and she even looks like she is physically holding the caterpillar when she uses it. It will fall out of her mouth but stay close enough that she can root around and get it back in there quite often. Plus, it is adorable! I only wish it were removeable so that it could be better washed and she would be able to keep the toy once she no longer needs the paci or I could replace the paci if, oh, my dog chewed that part up or something."
This is the same pacifier my son used in the hospital and has used ever since. I love them and they're easy to sanitize. A must have for all babies
the lanolin really does come off onto your nips and helps with soreness. they are worth more $$ than the regular ones.
these little guys are so adorable and much larger then i imagined. i can't wait to hang them in my sons nursery. perfect touch to his sports theme. love them!
"easy instructions,  stroller is light weight, practical and durable.  i purchased this stroller as an \\extra\\ to keep at grandpa's when baby visits, so as not to have to bring a stroller on the plane.  we like this one even better than the more expensive  stroller at home. it was shipped quickly and arrived even earlier than promised. very satisfied with this purchase."
"these are wonderful. i have the bamboo ones. i had given up on reusable nursing pads after trying two other brands that didn't work well. luckily i decided to try these, because i love them. they are really soft and there's no lint sticking to my nipples. they are absorbent and have a breathable nearly waterproof backing so your bra doesn't get wet but your boobs don't feel hot and clammy. (i don't think it would be completely waterproof, but so far i've been dry. i use it to catch the letdown on the other side when i'm nursing and can use the same one all day.) they don't bunch up in the wash like the other one i tried, so it sits nice in my bra and is not noticeable under clothing (within limits--you would see them if you were really looking, or wearing an unlined nursing bra and a tight fitting, light colored t-shirt). overall i'm really happy with these. i use their cloth diapers too and love all their products."
"for the past month i've been torturing my five month old with the hospital's nasal aspirator. not only does her crying probably just worsen the situation, but the last time i used it i made her bleed. after that, i decided there had to be a better way. then a friend told me about the nasalfrida. what a great product. first of all, the name itself is awesome. i simply refer to it as the snotsucker. second, it works. for the past two nights my daughter has actually been able to breathe as i nursed her to bed. finally, it's so much fun to use. the first time i did it my daughter cried because i think she was still traumatized by the regular aspriator, but tonight there was no fight and even a giggle at the end! a giggle!!"
"the bag is perfect for my son's stuffs...diapers, small toys, milk, small food and few clothes. the bag is very spacious and very convenient to take anywhere we go."
this cover is very sturdy and painted well. i was worried it would not look exactly like the picture but it does and looks great in my sons nursery! it will make you want to buy the whole kids line sports decor :)
i love the sippigrip. it keeps the sippy cups and toys off the floor and in the stroller. perfect for my 1 year old twins!
we did our homework on the best child safety products before we bought these magnets and found all kinds of positive reviews from other parents. these magnets were easy to install without having to drill into our cabinetry and work really well. we are very pleased!
this is one of the best purchases i have made! it allows me to wear necklaces while toting my daughter around. it distracts her from the real jewelry and she's content chewing on the ring. i would never have thought it would work but it did. highly recommend this item!
"with my first baby 8 years ago, i found the only use for a monitor was during the day, when i'm on the go -- so that i could listen for the end of a nap (since at night all the crackling, and meaningless baby stirings only served to give me a terrible nights sleep.  when she was really awake or needed attention, i woke plenty fast).  and although most baby gear had been long since been purged out of my basement, i still had my basic sound monitor from all of those years ago.  and at first the baby was in a bassinet next to me, and then -- knowing how terrible the sound from my old monitor was -- i didn't even hook it up!  but i really did want a day time monitor. so something possessed me to spring for this one and -- wow! i am impressed.  the sound quality is excellent and no crackling -- and it goes into a sound passive mode when all is quiet up there.  and the temperature monitor is a nice extra although not high utility for me (we have central air and great heat so not something i worry about too much).  and heck, it looks cute too.   so the point is, if you're not as easy going as me or your baby's room/crib is far enough away that you want a monitor on overnight too - this is a great choice! you might actually get some sleep.  the only thing i wished for was to find an offering with audio only (like this one, with no movement monitor) that has two remote listening handsets.  my husband and i often do tag team on the baby care while each is off doing things with our \\big kids\\ or chores around the house and yard, so it really would be best if they had a 2 handset offering like they do with the movement monitor offering.  they migtht make it, but i couldn't find it anywhere."
"seems like a very nice product.  i have been trying for months to get my son to take a pacifier, but he does not want it!  but i give it 5 stars because it seems very well made, and i like that they come with individual covers."
we took this stroller on vacation to yosemite and san francisco.  it's a very basic stroller but the kids seem comfortable and i like the 5-point harness.  our stroller made the trek down some tough trails and performed beautifully.  it's a great value and i would definitely recommend this to someone else.
his nanny bought him his first and he used it so much that i had to find the exact some one to replace it. i bought two. great product. would recommend.
"Wubbanubs are Great! They stay in place so much better than your ordinary pacifier.  Now you don't have to use one of those horrible clips to hold the pacifier onto your child's clothes.  The wubbanubs are also great for when it's time to lose the pacifier because the child doesn't want to carry it around so he gives it up himself.  I give these an A+ and wouldn't have a baby without one.  For those who say they would never give their baby a pacifier I say I can always take the pacifier away, but you are stuck with a child that sucks it's thumb!!!"
We got this bear for our daughter when she was just born and it has been her favorite since ! Along the way we got her a second one just because hers needed a wash and she wont be without it for that long ! Great product great price and so cute ! Also it was always easy for her to put the binky in her mouth at night ! Shipped fast !
"I was sick of fumbling around in the middle of the night for my daughter's paci.  This solved the problem.  Even if they hadn't been in any light, they were still visible hours after I put her to bed.  They also helped her learn to put her own paci back in.  I would highly recommend getting a few of these!"
I LOVE these. They're all I use for my binki-addicted baby. She can even hold onto the bear and is figuring out how to put it in her mouth. They're great for car trips because you can put the arms through the straps to hold the binki in--- which makes car rides that much easier!
I bought this and 2 other Wubbanubs. It's all I use and they're absolutely fantastic. They wash easily and hold up really well.
"Pirate stuff is awesome no matter what, when I saw this I really wanted one for my newborn son, and ordered it right away, then when it arrived I was surprised how big the skull was on the other side and relized that he would need to be 6+ months before he could hold the weight of this thing!! Either way I thought it was still adorable and can't wait to use it."
"My son will only take a pacifier like the one given at the hospital. I was so excited to see this toy/pacifier. He's now 3 months and loves this! He can move his pacifier to his mouth himself, something he could not yet do w/o the attached toy. As a bonus, the puppy is too cute!"
Was suprise because wehn i turn off the light the holder was glowing.its nice cos in the middle of the night dont need to actually get up and find where is the pacifier went. Will recommend it
I bought these for my new nephew and his Mom and Dad really liked them!  I didn't use them personally but they make a great gift of super fans!
Wubba Nubs are the real deal.  We have ordered 8-10 of these from Amazon.  Our babies have loved them and cherished them.  They don't fall out and bounce and they can hold on to them.  Love the Wubbas!!
"These were the only paci's our daughter (who is now 15 months) would take. They come in fun, bright colors, which is great because that makes them easier to find at the bottom of the diaper bag!"
"Love this and would recommend to any new parent to get for their little one.  It's perfect for traveling.  We leave it our son's carseat for any trip.. easy for him to hold onto, pick up if he drops, and doubles as a play toy!  My only negative would be the price.. you can get the same thing for about half the cost, but I really liked the dragon.."
"I wish i thought of this! Perfect for baby to have something to hold, esp in the first months when they get startled & jump easily!"
Just exactly how I imagined it would be. Great prouct; even fits a couple bulky Soothie pacifiers and easy to access as well as attach to diaper bag!
this thing is amazing!!!!!!! i bought this instead of a high chair. and we are soooo happy we did!! we love it and i would recommend it to anyone who needs a booster/high chair for their baby!!! save your money and buy one of these!!! :)
i bought this when it was time to take a road trip with my 6 month old. i had been using a small handheld in the car for other times we were out & needed to pump but for long trips only my symphony would cut it. love this. felt 100% the same power you get from plugging into wall. can't live without
"fits the doorway perfectly, looks great, seems very stable. my dog is a climber, but the vertical bars and lack of footholds stops him from even trying. i like that the gate opens both ways, and will close itself unless you open it all the way, at which point it stays open. perfectly-designed, in my opinion, and i'm about to order a couple more."
on time and the quality of product is excellent and the price is the lowest on the market. i would tell a friend. thanks!
"i got this for my 22 months daughter.  she still has times on my ergo, but mostly it is reserved for my 5 months old.  she loves dolls and copies everything i do.  she loved her own ergo!  i was reading the reviews and was ready to use the strap from the box to keep it in place; but this was not needed as her ergo came with a back buckle! just like mine! it stays in place and she is happily taking her doll for walks as her mommy takes her baby brother!  we love it"
"this is one of the best parenting tools when your child has a cold and a stuffy nose, but can't blow his nose for himself.  sounds gross, but it works fabulously and turns out not to be gross after all!"
"this thing is great!  there are so many ways it keeps your baby entertained.  the wheel looks really cool when you spin it fast, it makes a fun noise (seriously, the only toy in my house that makes noise that i don't find annoying!), there are little bead-like things (don't worry, they're not coming unattached no matter what), it spins and turns, i could go on & on.  it's so worth the money, my baby is 9 m & still gets a kick out of it regularly."
it is easy to assemble and weights practically nothing! we love it and are really happy we chose this one instead of another car travel system.
great design. one of the better kids accessories i have botten. i feel like my money was well spent. i have bought so much junk that gets thrown away as far as bottle and containers ect for my kids. i still use these and they are sturdy and useful. good to use the bottle strap u can get on amazon. hook it around the handle and now you can have a container of snacks on your stroller that wont spill when your kid throws it on the floor. nice soft top that dosent come off easy.
i can't live without these things. we use the sippy cups with straws & this cleans them out very well. nice and cheap & durable. one pack lasts about 6 weeks. great product. so glad it exists.
"i love this mobile and so does my baby.  it was the first item that would get (and hold) her attention when she was a few weeks old.  it's so cute, i decorated the whole nursery around it."
"I am very satisfied with the product.  It is just a shame that the only place a person could find this product was threw Amazon.  It is a very sturdy product. What more can you say?  It works, thank God."
The pacifiers came just in time for my trip to see my grandson.  He absolutely loves only these types of soothies and they work so well.  Fast delivery great service.
"This is the pacifier that they gave my daughter at the hospital, and she loves it. They last forever, my older daughter also used this kind, and they are fairly big so they are easy to find in the crib at 2am."
This product was perfect and so cute! The shipping was fast and the item was as expected. Very pleased with this purchase. It was a gift and it was very well received.
"Love Wubba Nubs, love this elephant version.  Very soft and cute! We always get compliments when out and about with it."
This is simply the best pacifier we have been able to find. It is made of high quality rubber and our daughter loves it. It seems like it will last a long time. It is made in Italy.
my daughter just love teething blanket i'm trying to buy her different kinds... this one serves its purpose. i received neither one in the photos... i got a green teething blanket embroidered with one bee and yes only two teething corners. it really varies in color and design but it doesn't matter as long as my 6 mo. old daughter appreciates what i get for her.
got this pacifier for my first granddaughter i luv the fact that it says princess on it so very happy with it
"I bought this for my 5 month old.  She uses the green pacifiers attached to it, so I figured she'd love this.  And, she does!  It's the perfect size for her little hands.  She enjoys feeling the different fabric textures and chewing on the arms/legs.  She's still learning how to put the paci in her mouth, but she's almost there."
My baby is almost 4 months old and absolutely loves it..its easy for her to hold onto and it goes everywhere with us...
Love this pacifier. It is just like the ones issued in the hospital - only it's not green. I purchased this because of it's girly colors. My baby doesn't like any other pacifiers other than the soothie. Love it and so does baby! :)
This pacifier attacher is great. It is much nicer than the fabric ones and I love the skulls :) Perfect for your bad boy.
"I didn't want to give my baby any items with potentially harmful substances (Phlates & BPA's specificallY), so I was searching high and low for natural baby items.  I was very pleased to find this item and my baby loves chewing on these.  I like that these are natural products and I feel confident in giving these to my baby."
"Such a great accessory for an infant.  Stuffed toy attached to NUB pacifier keeps paci from slipping down in car seats, beds, etc., and is a cute plus to boot!  Excellent gift for any young thing!"
Just a nice handy item to have.  Leave it hooked to the outside of our diaper bag for easy access.  Easy to clean too.
"this product is excellent!  i can fit 6 bottles, 2 full sets of pumping accessories, several pacifiers and several other items on it at once.  it's also cute."
"i got this lamp mainly to go with the bedding set, but when i got the lamp i was so glad because it is so adorable and it is defi. worth the money. i would recommend anyone that has a theme with ladybugs or anything that would go with this lamp to get it."
"i love these. i was concerned that the printed side wouldn't be as absorbent as the terry cloth side, but both sides are quick to absorbed moisture. i like the small size. depending on how i'm using them, i like to have some large burp rags and some small ones. these ones are great for wiping my baby's mouth, and because they're a little stiff the work great to cup under the baby's mouth when holding her up in a sit for a burp. if your holding your baby over your shoulder to burp, then these will definitely be too small.<br /><br />and of course, the pretty designs are very nice. not exactly as pictured though. i received two with flowered patters and two with the diamonds. no solid. i'm okay with that. i ordered these and the green ones. they came prettily wrapped in a large ribbon that says \\eat\\ all over it - very cute - with a large button on the front, not a knot. great for a gifts, but i got them for myself. :)"
"This is a very thick mattress and it fits the bottom of my child's Graco Modern Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Zurich perfectly. One thing to note: I also purchased a water-proof liner for the mattress but it is not necessary because this mattress is made of water-proof material."
I bought this as a baby gift after seeing my nephew using his. Hope this helps my friend never loose a pacifier again. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the pacifier is stuck there. It can't be removed. It would be nice to be able to change the pacifier. Other than that it looks like a great baby gift.
"Their nice, strong, easy to clean and boil, super cute and good to go for football season! great over all passys!"
"This is the only paci my son would take. Like what others said, this was given in the hospital he was born. It was really a life saver on those fussy moments! Helpful to have a couple of these in your bag, car, crib, daycare etc!"
I was always a fan of the Soothie pacifiers but didn't like how big they were around. I think these are just what I needed. My son loves them and the Blue is so pretty.
This pacifier is so easy to find.  We have had two for over a year and my daughter can find it easily on her own. Great product!
"Mr. Toutou is my daughter's friend.  She's had him since she was about 3 mo old, up to now (11 mos). When she dropped and lost him one time, we got her another one. Mr. Toutou can calm her at night when she wakes up in the dark, and she goes back to sleep on her own. She likes to suck on the pacifier, the ears, the limbs, everywhere! It's good that the pacifier detaches and I can wash the stuff toy part.  Now that she's teething, she also bites the circle around the pacifier - suprisingly, not the pacifier itself. The only reasone this gets a 4.5 instead of 5 is when we got MT 2.0, we noticed that the ears are much shorter than the original MT.  We loved the floppy ears.  Oh well... It's still great, all around."
Fast shipment!!! My daughter loves it! Very cute!! Love that its so easy to find at night!! Can't wait to buy more!!!
"Our 6 month old MUST have dragon to fall asleep - he's a savior! Plus, unlike a regular pacifier, he's easy to keep a hand on so he won't fall on the floor. And we sometimes tether him, too. The only problem is that the dogs have destroyed two of them. so if you have dogs, get a couple extra Dragons."
"I saw a little boy with one of these and had to order one for my son. It's so cute when you look at it, and when my son is using it, even cuter! Many variations to choose from but I chose the doggie! Well made!"
My almost 6 month old loves these.  It's not much larger than the one he used after the smoothie ones from the hospital but we like that it doesn't mash into his big cheeks and the clear allows us to see more of his sweet face (since he's got it in all the time)!
Not only is it adorable but my daughter loves it. Its her friend as well as a soother. I have sewn new binkies on it when our dog ate it off and we have never lost this. I'm buying this as a shower gift for every shower I go too! The best part is they go with any theme and when its time to say goodbye to the binky they can keep their friend forever!
"This is the paci that my baby was given in the hospital and the only one she will still take.  I had to order more just in case we ever lost the one and I love Amazon because shopping with a baby isn't very easy...awesome product, awesome service."
"I got one of these at the hospital, and it is the only pacifier my son has ever accepted. Highly recommend you at least try it if you haven't already. It's great, because you can stick your finger in and babies tend to latch onto it better when you do.<br /><br />And they look like a suckerfish, as you can see by looking down the translucent nub. It's entertaining AND useful.<br /><br />And I totally don't laugh at my child.<br /><br />---------UPDATE 10/18/2013----------<br />My second son is now four months old and he has never once liked these pacifiers. It is true that all babies are different, and they all have mouths of different shapes and sizes. It always seems like it is awkward for him to latch onto the soothies (I've tried both the 0-3 month and next size up). They work okay if we can hold our finger there, but once we let go he spits it right out.<br /><br />I am leaving my rating at five stars because they were still a lifesaver with my first-born. They are a quality product made out of a sturdy material, and the shape is brilliant (it is never going to get swallowed). I also recommend trying a few types, though. NUK is his favorite. Hope this helps!"
"We received a Wubbanub as a baby shower gift for our now 5 1/2 month old baby. She loves it! Initially I thought we would not use it, but as it happens, grandma popped it in her mouth while we were out one night when baby was only a few weeks old and it was an instant hit (we had previously only tried a couple other brands, which she rejected)  History was made and we have a slew of pictures to document her fondness! Only at over 5 months old now, it has become a bit of a distraction when trying to get her down: she loves to play with it (giraffe is what we have, which is totally cute) and the stuffed animal is something to tug on, thus pulling it out of her mouth.     I vowed to give this as future shower gifts and just sent the Ella Bella elephant one to my sister. I hope her new little one likes it, I haven't gotten any feedback yet. I have now been searching for a binky that is of similar feel but without the stuffed animal - something that won't be distracting for when we are trying to put her down. We will still use this one for awhile yet, though. Cleaning is not too much of an issue - can either throw it in the washing machine or hand wash to clean the animal."
"I ordered these because these are the kind of binks that my kid likes. He is very soothed by them and goes right back to sleep if Im quick enough. I saw that the colors could vary, but if I really cared that much about what color the things were I would have driven my lazy butt to the store and picked some out in person. I put the pink one up as an emergency back up and attached the green and blue one to his pacifier clip. Tragedy averted."
I was looking for pacifiers and came across this.  It is the cutest thing.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet as I still have two months to go.  My friends that have seen it want one so I will be buying a few more to give as gifts.
"This is very useful in the car seat when the baby is too small to hold in the paci.  It will help keep the paci in the mouth.  She can hold it easy too!  Now that she is 8 motnhs old, we put it in her crib with her and if she wakes up she can find it herself and put it in her mouth.  Again, I can not say how great this was for the car seat!  It washes easy in the washing machine.  I buy these for every baby shower I go to.  They are cute, cuddly, and work great!!!!  We love this product!!"
My daughter's favorite and now mine.  Can't find them in stores so Amazon makes it so easy to order them.
"We purchased the monkey Wubbanub for our son when he was six weeks old.  It has become such a staple in our lives that we thought we had better get a back up because our lives would be VERY difficult if we should ever lose monkey!  We purchased the lion Wubbanub and he loves it just as much.  It's cute because he likes to hold onto his mane while he's sucking away.  This thing is a lifesaver, trust me!"
"Both of my sons refused every pacifier except the Soothie for the first few months of their lives.  They even rejected the new Gumdrop pacifiers, which are similar to these but do not touch baby's nose.  Apparently my boys like these even though they look too big for a newborn.  Must be something comforting about it."
"We love all the wubanub pacis.  My baby, a preemie by two months, has loved the monkey wubanub since he was around 4 months. he is now 10 months old and it is a critical part of his bedtime routine.    I bought this elephant as a baby shower gift."
"I ordered this for my girlfriend as an 'early' birthday present! It arrived in FOUR days, packed well & was in GREAT condition! Would definately deal with you guys again!  Paul  Tucson,AZ"
I love this product! I try to use natural things for my baby and this pacifier is perfect. I'm pregnant with my second child and plan on using again. I recommend using this pacifier above all other natural rubber pacifiers. I have tried the natursutten ones and do not like them at all!! The way the little handle is it jus collects fuzz and dirt that you cannot get off! Absolutely horrible! So I recommend this product above all others.. And I think my daughter would agree! She loves it too! :) hope this helps!
"i ordered my first package of these a week or so ago and have already bought more! they are perfect reusable cloth diaper liners. they are not doublers and do not add any more absorption, rather they allow urine to pass through them and wick away moisture from your baby's bum.  they also make cleaning up poo much easier and cut down on staining the actual insert or shell of the diaper.  i use these with my best bottom hemp inserts.  hemp takes a little longer to absorb than micro terry and my baby's bum was suffering.  these liners give the hemp time to do their job while keeping the moisture away from my little one's sensitive skin.  i like that they are thin and do not add any bulk.  so far, they have stayed in place perfectly for us. thank you bummis for a perfect and inexpensive solution."
"its a shame that this cradle bumper has received poor reviews just because the reviewers thought it was for a cradle.   we used this bumper with matching sheets every night for my daughter's first three months. it was soft, beautiful, and washed without any problems."
i bought this for my daughter who is now 3 mos. old. she has reflux and has to be sitting up at all times to keep her bottles down.  i bought this to keep her upright and give her bouncy seat a break! the first night she slept in it she absolutely loved it.  i put her in it for her morning nap and rocked it a little bit just to see her smile so big! she loves it!
"we bought this car seat for my husbands car (we only had one in my car).  the one i have is the britax blvd and this graco comfortsport is comfortable, and very secure (check the consumer report ratings, very high security wise).  the only bad thing was the head support, we ended up removing it and my toddler doesnt need it anymore...it still is not a big deal  overall highly recommended for its safety reviews, comfort and price!  great purchase!"
this is super cute and soft the boppy i had came with a boy theme so i was really happy to get a girly theme for my daughter.
"fits perfectly over my chicco cortina travel system stroller. its a great fit with or without the car seat. its made of a heavy, durable feeling plastic. glad i purchased this one.<br />only complaint is that it's hard to fold up and fit back in the bag but i just fold it up and take it along. it's fine."
"not sure why amazon consider's this as a toy. it asked me to rate it as if it is a toy. this is bedding set!  anyways, bought the whole vroom collection for my son.  really great product.  has the perfect boy colors and designs.  works get with rest of the collection."
"somehow the gate gods were smiling at me the day i bought this gate.  i have 5 dogs, and i can't keep them out of the dining area.  the width of the opening from the dining area to the family room was 130 inches, and this gate opens up to 144inches.  i had to find out this information from the reviews....as amazon doesn't really post a description about the products..unless i'm missing something.    anyway    love this gate!  it's cute and keeps out my 5 beasts!"
i used one of these when my son was little and loved it...so i found this one for my grandson...all i can say is love it love it love it...
"i decided to go with washable pads since i didn't like the disposable one. i first tried the one by \\philips avent \\ but my shirts were always wet and i had to change pads many times a day. then after a few research on the web i found that the fuzzi  had great reviews and customers were satisfied with it. so i bought them and as the other customers, i'm very pleased with it. they are large ( might be too large for a small breast) and absorb everything. i don't need to change them many times a day. now only once a day and even for 2days is more then enough. they are washable and i even put them in the drier. these are the best nursing pad i have tried and i'm very satisfied with it!"
"although this item is bulky, my husband says that he can knock people down with it, lol, this item holds a carseat.  it makes the carseat easy to transport when traveling through an airport.  you will get strange looks but oh well at least your child is safe."
"the shade of grey is very delicate, and the fabric is nice and soft. i haven't used it yet. been too warm outside, but this will be great for fall and spring. i will use a down bag for the winter. yes, i live in the north where it gets very cold:)"
this is an great product. it was comfortable and easy to use and allowed me to pump at work while still getting things done on my computer. a must have for working/nursing moms!
"i just received the unit, and can't speak to the long term reliabiltiy, but i am most impressed with the quality of the video, audo, range and features. its two way communication allow the parent to remotely turn on different functions in the camera..like music, night light.  the one feature that had me going was a rotary switch on the camera which sets the sensitivity for an alarm in the monitor whenever the sound threshold in the baby's room is exceeded.  it was set for maximum sensitivity and the alarm was reporting continuously.  took me a while to find out what the cause was.  a couple downsides to the system.. if the noise threshold sensitivity level is set high (so you can hear a pin drop in the baby's room, the the alarm will go off when you remotely switch on the music.  also, the camera has a room temperature monitor, but it is mounted so close to the camera, that it reflects more the camera temp than the room's.  so it reads about 10 degrees warmer on the monitor and is virtually useless.  (not a deal breaker though). overall it seems like a great system.."
"the blankets are super cute. i got the ecru color scheme; there are several pattern choices and they are all adorable. the blankets are soft to the touch, not too thin but also not thick and rigid. i haven't used them yet (due in a few weeks) but already washed them. they kept their shape very well after one wash/dry cycle (i will update if they loose the shape later on) as opposed to the just born flannel receiving blankets which i also purchased at the same time. in retrospect, i wish i just got two sets of the carter's blankets.  five months later: my baby is 4 months now and those blankets are our favorite. they still look very cute even though the colors faded just a bit.  they keep the shape nicely though. i use those mostly to cover my son on days when it's warm in the house; they are perfect to keep him warm but not hot. i also use them to cover him during night feedings. my mom usually places this blanket under the baby when she rocks him to sleep. she puts him down in his crib with the blanket so that the blanket touches the cold sheets of the crib. this minimizes the chance of him waking up."
"bought this travel potty to keep in the car for the kids and it's perfect!  fits compactly under the driver's seat.  my 3 and 4 year old boys love to use it.  love that it uses gallon sized bags.  the two storage compartments are a bit tough to snap open at times, but maybe because our potty is still somewhat new.  compartments are great storage for extra bags, wipes, and spare undies.  i also keep a few nursing pads in there.  i found that if i put one at the bottom of the bag before the boys use the potty, it helps soak of some of the \\liquid\\ for less sloshy disposal.  would recommend!"
this extension kit makes your playyard bigger and better!  our child has more room to play without feeling as much confined.
i love how easy it is and how attractive it is. i use it outside under our covered veranda. it matches our iron railing so well! it's a great safety feature that looks like it just fits in perfectly!!! great
i love this potty seat. i can't even begin to tell you how great it is. it's made out of sturdy plastic that seems as if it will last a long time. it fits snugly in/on the toilet with no problems. the adjusting mechanism is genius. it's super easy to clean and i don't have to worry about the seat absorbing any bathroom nastiness. it comes off the toilet quickly and easily for adult users and the handle allows for easy hanging. my son loves sitting on it and hasn't looked or acted uncomfortable during use. he has great confidence sitting on this seat. the splash guard isn't too short or too high and the hole is just the right size for my potty-training toddler. we haven't had any issues as of yet and i am thrilled to own this. we tried self-standing potty chairs as well as the seats that attach to the toilet. this is by far my favorite.
Very cute and matches with the rest of the Laguna theme. Light is slightly dim but enough to see what you are doing. A baby's room doesn't need to be brighter. I'm very happy with this purchase.
"this mattress makes such a difference in the continued usability of the pac n play.  at 23 pounds, my granddaughter no longer seemed comfortable sleeping on the original thin \\mattress\\ that comes with the playard even though i had put a quilted pad on it.  this mattress fits perfectly, tightly enough to not invite little fingers but easy enough to take in and out to change the sheet or if you want to use the pac n play as a playpen.  a good price for a really good product."
"got these as replacements. they say to replace them every 3 months or so. sounds good to me. best deal i found. these work on all 3 types of avent pumps, i have the manual, the uno and the duo."
"this is a great concept, but as others have stated beware of bananas.  my son loved bananas, so i just bought a bunch of the extra nets because they do get ruined after putting bananas in there.  my baby especially liked when i put frozen fruits in there for him!"
my daughter is just over three months old and i attatch this to her playmat. she loves to reach for it and bat at it. i enjoy the different colors and different textures.  this is an enjoyable toy to have for her.
"i've had this set for 6 months now.  my 3 year old seems to do fine with it, and it has held up well.  i hand wash it, but the bowl has been dropped tons of time and has held up great without any dents or dings.  the bowl does slide around a bit (versus the plastic bowls we have with the rubber base), but i think that's just a trade off.  the cup is light and easy enough for my son to hold and drink from.  i saw some comments that this set is tiny, but the small plate size has worked for us.  i'd actually rather give my son two small servings than pile on all the food at once, but that's totally just personal preference."
"i love, love, love this for garland for decorating the wall above my son's crib.  we didn't want anything permanent for decor in our baby's room because they grow out of those murals/infant wall art so quickly.  this is colorful, cheery and tasteful.  relatively inexpensive too when you consider how pricey decorating a room can be.  plus, we can use this when #2 comes along, boy or girl, and aren't locked into something gender specific!  this is contemporary without being super modern, and goes well with any color paint / bedding."
this is the best! i had the boppy pillow but gave it away and bought this after trying it at my dr.s office- in comparison it is thicker and much larger to really support the baby while nursing. i would absolutely suggest this pillow to any first time mom!
i love these! they not only come in cute designs and colors but these are the only binkys my baby would ever take! i'm so thankful for them :)
"i'm 100% satisfied with the kidco convertible crib bed rail i purchased.  it was a simple set up and has been durable and reliable.  i was looking for something that would keep my 2 year old from rolling out of bed - but wanting a rail that wasn't as large, tall and bulky as the other bed rails i was seeing everywhere.  the height is exactly what i wanted and it is of good quality.  i am so pleased i found this on amazon, its been a great purchase!  thanks kidco for making a common sense, good quality product!  ;)"
This was the only pacifier that was the right size for our newborn.  She seemed to gag on the others once in a while; they were to big even though were size 0.  Good shape and fit and very cute designs.
"I love wubbanubs and so does my baby! The soothie style pacifier is the only one he will take, but they are hard to keep in. I like having the stuffed animal attached as it helps keep it in and makes the binky harder to lose."
"Love, love, love this lion wubbanub. It is so cute and the satin mane and satin tip on the tail are perfect for rubbing. We have already had the duck, frog and elephant and this is a welcome edition. :)"
"My wife bought this for her godson, and he loves it. It was smaller than she had pictured, but ended up being the perfect size for him. Talking about size, the monkey is the size of beenie baby. She said the only thing she didn't like was that the actual pacifier can't come off to be cleaned. Her friend bought pacifier wipes to clean it."
"Pros (mam binkies really are the best):<br />1.  When your baby gets to be old enough to bring things to his/her mouth, these binkies are very easy to get in!  There's no upside-down (like there is with most orthodontic pacifiers), and there's no floppy hook in the way.<br />2.  They're weighted extraordinarily well, and when they fall 90% of the time, they land without touching the nipple to the ground!  This is an enormously valuable feature!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  They're a little hard to come by, so when you find them, you've got to stock up!  I can only find the 6 mo size at Walgreens and my local grocery stores.<br />2.  They're more pricey than others.  (worth it, tho!)<br />3.  You can't pick the colors when ordered from Amazon.  I lucked out and got blue for my boy, but I could have received pink."
"since the baby just started sleeping in the crib i cannot talk about long term but the mattress fit nice and snug in the crib and is easy to lift out to change sheets, which fit nicely form the get go. there is ample support along the edges for when the baby is going to be standing there and the mattress is easy to clean any wetness or other messes off should they occur. my son seems very comfortable when lying on the mattress. i can't comment on firmness for my son since he barely puts a dent in a pile of cotton when on it but the mattress seems nice and firm to my test. i think for the price it is a great bargain. at the very least you will get a few good years while your child is still growing and putting on weight. i know we want to buy for the long term but to be honest, will we really keep this over 3-4 years? from what i have seen thus far, looks like a great product.<br /><br />i am changing the rating from a four star to five as the mattress has been a perfect fit and must be comfortable as the baby sleeps endlessly on it. very happy with this purchase."
"this is the coolest night light/ bed time lamp! well worth the $$$$. we purchased this for our 1 year old, and by the time night fall came our 11 year old daughter took it. not much of a hands on toy for the little ones, but it's defenitaly a great room deco. going to buy another today for our oldest daughter!"
"when i discovered that my 14 mo old son could drink from a straw, a started searching for a non-spill straw cup.  we have tried many and this is my son's favorite.  now 16 mo, this is his favorite cup to use.  he feels like a big boy and has no difficulty getting the liquid out.  for those that have expressed concern that it is too difficult to suck, i think it just takes practice for the little one to get used to it."
"my 6 month old grandson loves this giraffe, whether he is chewing on it or smacking it around to make it squeak, it's very durable and soft."
"my daughter uses this while she's teething and when i feed her. it's an easy way to prevent getting things on her clothes, since the bib is quite large. the material is so soft! and, the designs are very cute. this is a must have item! i love that you simply just pull it over baby's head and it stays on, unlike other bibs. it makes it easy when i clean up after feeding her because all i do is use the bib to wipe her down and nothing ever gets on her."
"babies spend a lot of time on their mattresses for many many years during childhood. consequently, we felt like it was worthwhile  getting a decent mattress and so purchased the moonlight slumber starlight support mattress which is amazing. with a nice mattress a mattress cover is a must as \\accidents happen.\\ this is a nice mattress cover. it is soft and fits snugly. no problems so far."
"i did'nt know what to get my grandson for his first birthday, and i came across this fishing set on amazon, and i was very pleased, when he found this toy to be his favorite among all the toys he recieved at his birthday party! he also takes it in the house and plays with it in his bath tub time. he has also learned the word \\fishie\\ from playing and understanding all the different toys. it is safe for him to play with which is a main concern of mine and i recommend it for any one year old, and he knows the concept of fishing for the toys with the magnetic pole. and it is nice that the magnet actually works with the toys as well. the toys also are squirters and he already learned to do that!"
"sturdy chair attaches to any table, we even took it to the beach with us! seat cover wipes clean very easily, only criticism i would have is there were no color choices...would have preferred something other than red but this is an awesome product for the money!"
The porch steps are wide and the gate needed an extension.  This works fine.  And looks decent too.
We got one like this in the hospital when our baby was born.  It is nice to have a simple one piece pacifier.  It is very easy to clean and withstood being boiled.  The baby loves it.
My baby loves these pacifiers and so do I! They are such high quality and so good on babies teeth.
"I bought this cute Binkibear for my 4-M-old son and he fell in love with Binki as soon as he saw it!! He really enjoys cuddling with Binki and plays with it. I even found my son rolling on the bed and still holding it in his arm!LOL The only thing I didn't satisfy is my son doesn't like the pacifier attached on Binki, but I think it's not a big deal, I can buy other pacifier to replace it."
"Love it. Soft and adorable. My daughter had it when she was small and even at one now, she still uses it like a lovey. It's easy for her to find at night when she wakes and fits perfectly in her small hands. I buy it for all my new mommy friends."
Perfect for a small baby...the stuffed animal lays on the baby and the pacifier is just the right size for his little mouth! We had a monkey and had to get a second in case it was lost b/c our baby loves it so much!
"My son loves this pacifier! He has been using it since we got it (he was 8 weeks). At first he could care less about the dinosaur attached and was just interested in the pacifier, but now he loves that he can grab it and move it around.  He doesn't have the ability to put a small pacifier in his mouth yet, but with the dinosaur he can hold it much easier.  I also love it because if you lay the dino on him or a surface with the pacifier in his mouth it doesn't fall out so easily as the pacifier alone.  A great help for when he wakes up when the pacifier falls out! Overall we find it so adorable and helpful - it goes everywhere with us!"
"Ever since I bought my friend a wubbanub for her son, I've been wanting to buy these for everybody. So far, all the babies seem to enjoy them! I bought this for my cousin and his girlfriend's baby boy. Way too cute!"
"This is the best!!  My son is able to take the pacifier in/out of his mouth on his own, we no longer lose pacifiers, and it is easy to catch if it does fall out or he drops it.  We give this to our 5 month old every night and we find him curled up snuggling with the lamb throughout the night.  Sometimes he will even put it back in on his own in the morning and go back to sleep for a bit.  This was a lifesaver for us!!!"
"After trying all kinds, these are the only pacifiers that my daughter will take.  I love them and they come in such cute colors!  So glad we found these!<br /><br />The glow-in-the-dark kind are especially genius... no more searching for lost pluggies with a flashlight trying not to wake the baby too much."
"My husband and I were given two orange newborn GumDrop pacifiers in the hospital and found that our daughter took to them quickly as she needed the additional suckling time and I couldn't be her permanent pacifier.  Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness/consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner/softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker/sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -> dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -> no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies/toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer/thinner/more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker/sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind."
Thank goodness that I was able to find these pacifiers on amazon! They are the only ones my son will use and it seems all the stores around have discontinued them. I wasn't too worried about color of pacifiers for when you are in need color doesn't matter...but only 2 days after placing the order I was pleased to have them arrive and extra happy to have gotten blue ones! Would order these again if I needed too!
"I have a giraffe and this elephant. The giraffe is my and my daughter's favorite, although it seems to cost more than the elephant everywhere I've checked. I get so many comments from people about these. Not only are they cute, but they are also very effective. Tiny babies can find it easier and as they get older, it becomes a little like a lovey. Mine holds the ears while she nurses and then transitions to that nipple when she's done with me :)"
"we bought this to replace the flimsy old pad that came with our used changing table. we were sure to measure it before ordering, since changing pads come in various sizes. this fits the table perfectly, and i love that this is the nicest one we found here on amazon. many of the others looked flimsy & not as durable as this one. they all seemed to be very thin in the middle, unlike this one. i also love that this particular pad doesn't dip way down in the middle like all of the others, it's just a nice gradual indentation. i also like that it has the belt to ensure that baby won't fall. the only thing i didn't like about this was the stinky smell of chemicals that the bag it came in had. the pad itself smelled a tiny bit like that, but once i had it out of the bag and allowed it to air out for a few days, that was no longer an issue. i would suggest doing that either before baby arrives, or allowing it to air out for a few days before using it at the very least, so that baby doesn't come into contact with the chemical smell. overall a very great changing pad, and the nicest one we could find here on amazon."
"i wanted a star-child type doll for my 8 month old daughter, and this works perfectly as a bedtime lovey.  it's the perfect size for her hands and she has loved it from the moment i gave it to her.  the doll itself is very very soft.  i love that it's organic and sustainably made, too.  it's so affordable that i plan on buying several and keeping around as baby-gifts; i know many mamas that will like this for their little ones, too."
"no complaints at all on this. does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it's also easy to cut if you need to trim it down to size."
my daughter and i love these bibs for her  little girl/my granddaughter.  they catch all her spills and are a breeze to wash up by just rinsing under the faucet.  they fit her well time and make lunch time fun and easy to clean up.  we would definitely highly recommend these bibs!
"i am really glad i made the switch from plastic bpa free bottles to glass.  the glass bottles keep the milk from spoiling longer and are very easy to clean vs plastic.  not to mention safer for your child.  i have droped the bottle several times, with the cover on, and the bottle did not break.  the outer covers are bright and beautifull.  worth the money.  i just wish i got these when i had my first child.  i guess one draw back is the 9 oz size is a little heavy for my 9 month old to hold but they do make a smaller size.  also the nipples collapse and do not vent but i think you could purchase different nipples.  these are not problems for me."
this product is great!  first introduced this to my baby at two weeks.  she had reflux and the pacifier seemed to help sooth her. still loves it today and she's 6 months.  we have three different ones but the lamb is our favorite.
"the glider i purchased is very comfortable.  the color is perfect and has alot of support for my back.  i like the idea that you can lock the rocker in place. shipping was perfect, no chips or broken pieces.  i was very pleased with my purchase."
"We purchased this for our daughter and it was one of the best gifts we could give to her.  When she puts the baby down she can watch to make sure she is OK.  You not only can watch but also hear their every move so you are aware right away if they are awake, etc.  The monitor is clear to see and the sound is very good.  Definitely would recommend this for anyone with an infant or if you are a caregiver to an elderly person."
This is the perfect pacifier holder. Our daughter uses the Sassy MAM pacifiers and we are able to fit two in this holder. It keeps them clean and makes it easy to find a paci when you need one! Great buy!
I loved these pacifiers!  They are the best pacifiers!  My baby was breastfeed and I found these and they are great.  They actually simulate a nipple and move back and forth as the child is sucking.  So they are wonderful.  I have tried all the other pacifiers and my baby still seems to like this best of all.  Only trouble is stores have discontinued them...soo now you can only find them online.  So be prepared to order a few at a time!  Some folks say they have found mold in them.  I disinfect my nipples and pacifiers in boiling water every week and have found no sign of that!  These are a terrific product. I give it a 10 star in my book!
"LOVE IT!! I do NOT like that the seller made it look like it was only $10 and then oh yeah, the shipping is $10 for this item....WWHHHHAAAATTT! give me a break. BUT 15-20 is about the normal price range for these things around the board so whatever dragon lady. Have it your way. It was always easy to find. I wash it like at least once a week and let it air dry and my little man loves it and I get comments on it all the time. It doesn't weigh nearly anything so it's not hard for him to keep in his mouth either like I was thinking. The wings are much more bright turquoise blue and i think it's even cuter than the picture."
"These are the only only pacifiers my granddaughter likes!  They're most like the ones she was given in the hospital when she was born. If she loves them, I love them, too!"
"This is great! It helps keep the pacifier near baby's mouth, which is a lifesaver when driving. Our baby also loves playing with the toy monkey."
"My husband is a die hard Red Sox fan. Being from New England we just had to have these on our registry. I had my doubts about them since they weren't one of the big brands, but my baby loves them! He has a very deep palate and need something a bit longer than the average pacifier to trigger his suck reflex, and these worked great!"
"The first one that arrived didn't work, but a couple of days later I had a new one at my door! Very happy!"
My granddaughter loves her wubbanubs. She has several different animals.  They are well made ... soft and cuddly.  Pacifier is securely attached.  Worth every penny.
The product was not supposed to delivered until June 12- June 27 and I received the product on June 2.  I was very happy with the product and would purchase more items from this buyer!!!
My baby has used nuk pacifiers since he was born. He loves them and I love its colors and designs. I feel very comfortable and secure with all NUK products.
We searched for pacifiers that she would take for a while. We heard about these and tried them. It was worth it! She loves them. The only problem is that she is now mobile and has since lost all but one. I'm here ordering more. That's how good they are!
"I first bought this item when my son was a little less than 2 months old. He loved Soothie he got from the hospital but he kept dropping it. I wanted to get this one so that my son could hold it. He absolutely loved it! He went everywhere with it. He also played with it like a toy. Most of the time,this paci was the only way to calm my son down. I washed it in the regular washing machine with rest of his clothes and dried it in a drier with high temp many times and it was still fine. I ended up buying total 4 of them for my son. The difficult part was to get rid of this pacifier from him. He didn't go to sleep with out it. He became so fussy without it. However, last month when my son was 20 month-old, he chewed the soothie badly and tier all of them off. I didn't buy another one for him but I gave him a little teether just to keep something in his mouth when he gets fussy. First 3 days without this paci were very rough but he became fine without it after a few days. Now he is 21 month old, and still chews on teether a few times a day just for a little bit, but he is completely pacifier-free. I am very happy. This pacifier helped my son and my family a lot."
"LOVE these.....so does my son, and my nephew :)<br />DO NOT be fooled by the first years brans gumdrop....they are NOT the same...the inner plastic is harder, they are a glossy silicone not a softer silicone. My son loves the hawaii medical but not the first years."
"We had another pacifier that was given from the hospital. The one that we used was really good too except that it was too heavy for infants. Out son is now 8 weeks old and he always love to suck on a pacifier to comfort himself and we needed one to put him to sleep except the old one would fall out from his mouth when he was just about to fall asleep. So we we went to BabiesRUs to get a new one. This is the one that we bought. It's pricy compared to other ones but we wanted to right one so we didn't have to waste money on trying out multiple pacifiers.   This one is great. It stays in!! The only thing that bothers me is that water does get into the pcifier and we have to clean it really thoroughly. However, if we shake the pacifier really well, the water will go out and as I observed the pacifier, the water will not get back to our son's mouth.   We got another one from Amazon so we have 2 handy. However, I would probably go back to the old ones when he can suck on something that's a little heavier."
after searching for baby books this was the best fit and match for our son. the book has alot of options and was a perfect mothers day gift!
my son loved this toy when he was 8 months old and still loves it now that he is a year old. the only down side is that it does not walk or make noise for a long period of time. we still love it!
bought this item for my new grandson.  he sleeps safe and secure no matter where you sit it....it's like a hammock for babies.  he is so much more a part of our daily life because it is easy to move him from one area to another.  positioning helps keep formula down also.  item arrived quickly and in excellent shape.
"i've used this for my son while we've been out at the doctor's office and shopping.  my son is 2 1/2 and in the middle of potty training.  i wasn't sure if he'd sit on a big toilet without a seat, but with these potty toppers he was happy to sit there.  i was happy to have him sit there too because the topper covered up a lot of the seat so he didn't have to touch it.  overall really like the product."
"The hospital my son was born in used a 'Soothie' on him and I've used them ever since.  I love the 'Soothie' but it isn't easy to keep track of because the standard pacifier clips don't work on it.<br /><br />I started searching for a way to make it easier to keep track of.  Since his theme animal is the giraffe I found this cute way to hold onto the 'Soothie'.<br /><br />We call him 'Edgar' and I love it because it is cute and more importantly I can find it!<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is that Grandma had to reinforce the stitching in his neck right after we got it.  Otherwise, it has been a lifesaver!"
This lamb is adorable. Really cute. I love its tiny pink nose. Our daughter loves the stability of the WubbaNub and the shape of the soothie. Everything came well packaged and came quickly.
"I absolutely love this pacifier. They are easy to hold onto. When I need to be hands free I just stick the little tab in my mouth haha. Also the little hole in the middle is convenient. When my son is first trying to latch onto it I can put my finger in that and help him get a better grip on it. It's also really funny to look at. Lasst but not least, they are the only types of pacifier that my son will use. He loves them! They're a lifesaver for me."
I used this bear to break my daughter from her pacifier.  We used her own paci on it for a while and then switched over to the included teether.  It actually worked!  She's 19 months old now and she still loves this bear.  She won't sleep without it.  I wound up buying a second one just in case she loses the first one.
"Best baby invention ever! We have 2 wubbanubs (actually like the frog better, it lays on the baby better for ease of use when a newborn). We never lose a paci! Easy to clean, just throw it in the washing machine. Our baby loves holding onto the animal!"
"I added this to my baby registry and my daughter loves it! She is almost 5 months old now and she cannot sleep without dragon. My Aunt bought it for her and it is by far her favorite paci! I have tried others when dragon needs washed (by hand) and I had to buy a red and yellow puppy wubbanub because it closely resembles the dragon...<br />The pacifier is very securely stitched onto the dragon and it is relatively easy to clean. Just wash it in the sink with mild dishsoap and a cloth.<br />Ultimately this is a great paci, just wish they weren't so expensive.<br /><br />UPDATE: My daughter is now almost 2 years old and she still loves this binky. It is her absolute favorite! I had to buy a second one just in case the first one needed cleaned. Now, she sleeps with both and will NOT sleep without at least 2: 1 in her mouth and the other in her hand.<br />The stitching has held up wonderfully through the extensive use. I have not had to do any mending to it at all. I also started throwing the binkies in the washing machine on cold (delicate) and throw them in the dryer on low. Cleans them and they have stood up against the washings!"
"We were given one of these pacifiers at the hospital when our daughter was born.  We had a few around the house that we had boughten, or were given at baby showers.  She definitly prefers these pacifiers over the rest.  They dont have latex in them, which is nice, because the last thing you would want is for your baby to have a reaction, when you have no idea what alergies they may have.  They are also BPA free, which is a must with somehting that a baby will have in their mouth!  We have about 10 of these scattered about the house.  Great product!"
They work great for me! Granted you can't be in the darkest room in the house to see them but then you also can't see your baby! But if you have even the smallest bit of light for your baby then these will glow!
"I previously bought others from the Serta site.  They no longer carry them, but thank goodness Amazon does!  This one is smaller than the normal ones, and has a pacifier in its mouth, so is perfect for the newborn.  It was my daughters favorite shower gift.  Amazon also has others, and they are all equally as cute, soft, cuddly, and ones they will keep."
"I wanted to get the First Years brand, but had a hard time finding it, finally I gave up and bought this one. No Regrets!! My son has tried Nuk and the Playtex pacifiers so far he doesn't like them, he would keep spitting them out and cry. I finally gave him this pacifier last night and he loved it! He sucked on it and didn't want to let go of it. I love how it isn't too hard for him to bite on. Its just right for him. I recommend this pacifier to anyone!"
"This pacifier is perfect! It is a great comfort knowing my son's teeth are not being pushed on (as much). He took it without a problem and liked it for the short amount of time we got to use it. He decided he didn't want any pacifiers anymore about 1 week after I purchased it. I don't think this pacifier played a role in him deciding that. Overall, it is a great product and would recommend it."
I gave (sent) this item as a gift and was told they were delighted with the product.  Thank You!!
"Wife: My 5 month old will not take any pacifier, but this pacifier-like teething toy has been a wonderful relief for her teething woes. This item is one solid piece comprised of firm, flexible rubber. It features different textures, and every angle is chewer friendly. In addition, it is easy for tiny fingers to grip. One down side, it does NOT cool off in the refridgerator.     Husband: Most importantly, she likes it!"
"I had to buy this product. After receiving it at the hospital i tried others, they were not the same. She loved this pacifier."
"Try these pacifiers first, I wish I had. My baby loves these, I only wish we could attach a clip somehow. No matter, I am sticking with these as long as he adores them."
"This most adorable lamb has made giving a pacifier to a reluctant baby much easier. Our baby is exclusively breastfed (and only took to a pacifier for about 1-2 mths, and then said, no, thank you, in the form of WAAHHs!) so the pacifier isn't mommy, but this Wubbanub seems to help calm her down when I am not able to get to her (i.e. while she is in the carseat). She has even put herself to sleep with it in the car seat and the stroller. The lamb can rest comfortably on her chest while she finds the nipple herself, instead of me putting/holding a pacifier to her mouth (which would also annoy me if I were her). As others have stated, it would be great to be able to detach the pacifier from the Wubbanub, but oh well, it is still a must buy item. You will fall in love with this lamb. I even named it. :-D"
"My baby loves this binky! It has taught him to hold on to things as well. I like it because I can kind of 'prop' it up on him when he is laying down, and it stays in his mouth. Great quality and very cute! You won't be disappointed!"
Bought one of these to go along with my sons vampire costume and everyone loved it. Decent buy that put the finishing touches on my sons costume. >=)
"I am a Nanny to 9 month old twins. I bought this elephant paci as a gift for Easter for 1 of the twins . Usually the paci s get lost are difficult for child to put back themselves but, not with this paci! Best paci ever!!"
"These are the 3 month+, even though they don't say that.  Very excellent, daughter likes them.  She is starting to teeth a little, and she chews on them.  Hold up good!"
"I could have thought of a better gift for my lil baby girl. This is a great product, and hard to lose. My daughter is only 2 months old but she manages to hold onto the horse. I would definetly recommendthis product to all who belive in giving their child a pacifier."
These pacifiers are great!  We tried four different kinds for our newborn baby girl and these were the only ones that weren't too big for her little mouth.  As a result she's able to keep them in her mouth for longer (a plus for the parents!).  I am also breastfeeding and we gave these to her her first week home and she's never had a problem with nipple confusion.
"Baby looks adorable using it, and it does what it's supposed to - it pacifies a baby.  Worth the buy just for the cute factor.    Now that she is grabbing, she will occasionally take hold of the stuffed-animal part and pull it out of her mouth.  That's your only look-out on this item.  You want to stay close by till the baby's asleep, so you can pop it back in her mouth if she tugs it loose."
"i have these near the floor so my daughter can play with them, she likes them and they have stayed on the wall very well. they look great in her room."
"we love, love this car seat!  we bought this one when we realized how great our first roundabout 55 was.  so, we have two now... one for each car.  we didn't want to hassle with switching the car seat over each time we took a different car.  and since our decision was to install using the lap-shoulder belt instead of the latch system, installation takes a few more minutes than we have on a daily basis.  we switched our baby over to this car seat at about 6 mo old, but i can see how this seat would also accommodate a much smaller baby too.  we plan for him to use this until he outgrows it and moves into a booster.  my only concern is whether or not he will outgrow this before he can safely sit in a booster.  the seat seems to fit him perfectly now, so i wonder how much growing he can do before he's too big.  and, we're almost already using the entire strap length (not much more slack to pull out).  however, we had these concerns prior to deciding on purchasing this car seat (and then purchasing a second), and we are still entirely happy with this purchase.  i still would not buy anything else while having these concerns.  the quality is wonderful.  i have experience with other brands that our son's grandparents have in their vehicles, and i can say that i'd never buy any of them instead.  you can't even compare the quality and comfort.  the other britax models are great too, but we couldn't spend $300+ on a car seat when we needed to buy two.  plus, a friend of mine has the model with the built in head supports, and because her son was so tall, he was forced to use a different car seat because his shoulders were uncomfortable.  we figured we were safest if we just went with the basic model, which has proven so far to be a good decision.  highly recommend, as we will be repeat purchasers of this car seat."
i gave my 4 month old granddaughter sophie for easter and they have been inseparable ever since!  my daughter says it's the only thing that seems to soothe her gums and she will not let it go.  sophie has also become her security toy.  i'm ordering another one to keep at my house--just in case!  i would highly recommend her![[asin:b000idslog vulli sophie the giraffe teether]] is amazing!
"this is my 2nd child that i have breastfed.  i really didn't pump often with my previous son because he wouldn't take a bottle. i was determined to get this child to be able to take a bottle.  i had some issues with nursing and ended up meeting with a lactation consultant. in my meeting with her, i learned there was different sizes for the pump. i never knew that! i dealt with the pinching feeling because i thought that was how pumping was suppose to feel.  she was the one who told me that there was different sizes and taught me how things should look when pumping. i ordered the 30mm thinking it was big enough and found out that it wasn't. i was so glad to find the 36mm...no more pinching feeling! it feels great! it's pretty close to how things feel when i nurse my son!:d"
"My daughter has recently started to pull herself up in her crib. Of course she had started chewing on the crib rails. I did not want her doing this, so I bought this product. I have to admit I was a bit unsure at first as i was reading the reviews. But I decided it seemed like the best thing on the market. I am so glad I got it. It stays in place very well and DOES NOT move when she pulls herself to a standing position. I am now ordering two more of these for my sister as she has a little girl too! I would highly recommend this product."
"There are so many reasons your child will love this bear!  I had two wubanubs for our infant, which is all well and good.  But when he grew out of the infant pacifier and was teething, he couldnt use them anymore, they are sewn in!  This binky bear I was able to attach a teething binky to him! And take it off and put a different binky on another day, my son prefers this bear at bed time now because he cuddles him! I love the binky bear!"
"These are a must-have at restaurants when my daughter drops all her toys on the floor!  Since these wipes are food-grade [safe], I use them to clean the nipples of bottles while on the go.  These, combined with the ready-to-eat similac make for a much easier trip!"
"These a good pacifiers.  My daughter prefers the ones with the same nipple as the soothies that she used in the hospital.  These have the same nipple but with a bit harder, more contoured surround.  If your kids don't like the super soothies, but you're worried about them bending the soothies too much (and choking on them), the gumdrops are a great compromise. These are also a great option if you use a pacifier leash because they provide an additional hole in the tab."
"This is the next natural step from Soothie pacifier to teether.  Great idea!  I noticed that my daughter was starting to pull her Soothie pacifier out and chew on the sides when she was 3-4 months old.  I saw this on Amazon, and thought it made sense.      It's a great, tough, solid piece teether that she can use as a back- up pacifier!"
"I like these pacifiers.  They are nice clean and basic looking.  They are easy to clean and the plastic doesn't get all nasty looking, it stays nice and clear.  The only problem I see is something that is the same with all the pacifiers I have bought...water gets inside the nipple and eventually makes the inside of it have a cloudy look.  That doesn't effect the outside of it though. The plate of the pacifier has plenty of air holes to help with air circulation around the skin.    The best thing about these is there is no top or bottom to it.  This is good for a baby learning to put his own pacifier in his mouth or a half asleep baby grabbing for it in the middle of the night.    These come in a 2 pack of blue and red or green and orange.  Any are good for boy or girl."
"This is an amazing pacifier.  It actually stayed in my 6 week old daughter's mouth!  The soothie pacifier is the only kind my baby likes, but I was constantly having to pick it up or hold it in her mouth for her.  She was too young to hold it in her mouth herself.  The wubbanub is weighed down by the attached stuffed animal and it rests on your baby's chest.  So if it does fall out, it can usually be recovered by your little one.  This was a lifesaver during a 7 hour car ride!  I'm such a fan that I bought a second one because I don't know what I would do if we ever lost or misplaced the original one we bought"
"We went with the Soothie pacifier because I am breastfeeding and we wanted something that wouldn't cause too much confusion.  My daughter loved this pacifier, so we bought the pink / purple ones to have extras (in the diaper bag, in case one got lost - and they always get lost LOL!).  We never had an issue with it causing troubles with her breastfeeding.  I know several other breastfeeding Moms who use this pacifier too.  My daughter has now found her thumb, so prefers that to a pacifier, but I really liked this pacifier.  Plus it is easy to clean as it is one piece.  We did buy and try the gumdrop pacifiers as they have the same nipple, but are shaped to fit their face - they have a curve to the base and a cutout for the nose.  My Daughter didn't like those as much as her regular soothie."
This has saved my life.  Our newborn couldn't keep his binky in his mouth but wanted it so we would have to sit beside him and put it back in every 5min.  With this it weighs just enough to keep it in his mouth but light enough that if he doesn't want it he spits it out or just turns his head and it's out. Now at 3mths he holds onto it and falls asleep...it's so cute.  He can even put it back in his mouth
"They smell so good I could eat them, I smelt the bag for a good 20mins same with my husband.<br />They were a little big for my son when he arrived but soon grew into them, he loves the smell of them.<br />Sadly they lose the smell once they get washed,mine did anyway.Even without the wonderful smell they are a wonderful product."
I love these pacifiers! They are like the soothie only a little firmer and they don't block the baby's nose. Good for a baby over 3 months.
This is the only pacifier my granddaughter would take. We loved the scent and she loved the taste of it. We went thru several! Great size and perfect fit for her mouth.
"This is the same kind of pacifier you get in the hospital - and there is a reason for this:  newborns prefer this one.  As a first time parent-to-be I bought, and was given several different types of pacifiers - of course my son's favorite is the one we have only one of:  the one he went home with from the hospital.  I tried to get him to take another one, since I was afraid we'd loose this one (plus it's huge, and covers his cute little face so I wanted him to try the smaller clear one....no way he said!).  It was tough finding these in stores so I resorted to Amazon and bought SEVERAL so we will never be without!"
"What a great product. We started using this when my baby was 3 weeks old (he's now 7 weeks old) and couldn't keep the pacifier in his mouth, no it will not completely keep it from falling off, if baby doesn't want it he definitely spits it out, but it does helps the pacifier to stay in. One thing I loved about this is the fact that we can stick the arms of the little bear through the straps in his car seat (between baby's chest and the straps) and it holds it perfectly in place for the car ride, so I don't have to keep reaching back to put the pacifier back in my baby's mouth."
I bought a BinkiBear as a gift for a baby shower and the mom to be loved it!!!    It is super soft and the perfect size for little hands.  I wish this would have been around when my kids were younger!    You won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!
Wubbanubs are so great for newborns because they can easily put them back into their mouth after they have lost them.  They also give them a comfort item close to them.  I buy them for all of my friends with babies!
"If you haven't tried a Wubbanub for an infant or toddler who likes or needs a pacifier, you are missing out.  They are cute, durable, easy to hold, and keep the paci close at hand."
"I got the Wubbanub in the mail two days ago and I am already in love with it. This is something I wish would have been around a long time ago when I first started having kids!<br /><br />I did mistakenly by extra pacifiers thinking that they were replaceable/interchangeable, they're not. I can't complain about an assumption I made though, so I still give this wonderful product 5 stars."
I use these for baby wreaths. Parents love em and they're great for teaching a baby to hold things at an early age. I've been told they help with bottle holding too and I just adored this little dragon.
I use these for baby wreaths. They're very durable and I have yet to receive any complaints from new parents. They're so cute and meant to teach babies to hold things such as there bottles sooner.
"I love this!!!  My son is 3 mo. He loves playing with the giraffe.  It is nice because he can try to put it in his mouth all by himself.  I never lose the pacifer since it is attached, and it has less of a chance to roll and fall on the ground.  I will be buying another one in the near future."
"I love these so much that I even sent some to my friend back home in the UK because she thought the big American Soothie pacifiers looked ridiculous, and couldn't believe they would make one that would cover a baby's nose. Anyway, I think they are wonderful. Exact same nipple shape as the Soothie, but with room to breathe! My son doesn't have a problem with them either. I particularly like that, with this particular nipple shape, he doesn't really hold onto it for too long, and just sucks until he's pacified then spits it out. I don't foresee pacifier addiction in our future. Can't recommend it highly enough, and this is the best price around!"
"This is the only pacifier our son would take.  We have tried the soothies and Nuk brands, but he would just spit them out.  They have a cute design and I love the pacifier cover that comes with it!"
"My daughter refused every other pacifier until I found these.  I also use the playtex drop ins for bottles which most simulates the nipples for breastfeeding and so do these pacifiers.  My daughter has a tiny mouth and love, love, loves these!  We got a sample with the playtex bottle kit and ordered some on line asap!  Hard to find in the stores."
I LOVE wubbanubs! They are amazing! They don't stay in your babies mouth unless they are holding it in so no worry about them choking on it. It is very safe! It is simply just a very cute soothe pacifier! if your little one loves the soothe then get this! It makes the pacifier so easy to find and as your little one gets older it is also a little stuffed animal they can take along. Honestly when the pacifier gets worn out you can just cut it out and sew a new soothe in. I also have thrown this in the dishwasher and washing machine. it holds up great!!

Product got lost in the mail and they were great about sending out another one. The product was just as promised and I would definately do business with them again. :)
"These are great pacifiers. My two and half month old daughter loves them! We tried several brands like MAM, Nuk, Munchkin and Dr. Brown's. At first we thought Dr. Brown's would work better because we use their bottle system. She likes Dr. Brown's but she likes MAM even better. MAM's pacifiers look very cute and we also combine with the pacifier clips. The clips have bright color so you can easily identify where it is and the flexible clip allows you to adjust the tightness to thickness of baby clothes easily. We are very satisfied with the purchase and highly recommend these pacifiers to all new parents."
"We have a box full of pacifiers for our 2 month-old daughter, and one NUK Genius we received as a shower gift... and, of course, it's the NUK Genius (the *one* pacifier that we are unable to find at any of our local stores) that she truly loves. We recently (temporarily) lost our only NUK Genius pacifier, and were forced to order another on Amazon, balking slightly at the $5 price... but with her stubborn insistence, we went ahead and ordered it, deciding that $5 is not so much $$ for household peace...    We found the original pacifier we already owned, so now we have two, and are already considering buying a few more... just in case."
"This product is great!  My son loves it and it is easy for him to find in the middle of the night.  He also tends to throw his pacifiers out of the crib before going to sleep, so this one is easy to find and put back in the crib because it doesn't bounce.  The people at my son's daycare love it too!  Everyone has a similar pacifier and it is hard to mark them...this one is a one of a kind there."
"The caterpillar wubbanub is even more adorable in person than on the website.  My daughter loves to hold it and it allows her to be able to keep her soothie close by.  The only thing I didn't expect was that this wubbanub has a lemony scent.  Neither me nor my daughter are bothered by this, but those of you who are sensitive to smells may be put off by this.  I would highly recommend this product and have already!"
"This pacifier is the only one my daughter will take. We didn't accept pacifiers at the hospital as we wanted to make sure she latched on for breastfeeding. When we came home, she wouldn't take any pacifier that I registered for. I ordered this after the great reveiw and others saying they loved the ones from the hospital. Our baby took it right away and it is a savor for soothing her!"
"How many times does your baby drop their pacifier, are screaming, and you have that moment of well if I just wipe in on my pant leg it'll be clean enough and it's not going to kill them.  These are a must-have in your diaper bag so you can clean them properly before returning them to your baby's mouth.  They also have a nice smell and don't leave a poor after taste as my son takes his pacifier immediately after it's cleaned with these wipes."
"Unlike many other pacifiers, these are made of a single piece of silicone, which eliminates most potential choking hazards. In addition, being made of a single piece of silicone means  they are really easy to clean, which is EXTREMELY important, and they dry thoroughly and quickly. (You can even boil them to sterilize them.)  Other types of pacifiers we've tried  ended up with condensation/water droplets stuck inside them... no good.    Also, if you are concerned about nursing issues, that shouldn't be a problem with these pacifiers. They were recommended to us by a registered nurse who is also a lactation consultant. (Incidentally, she was not a fan of the orthodontic pacifiers.)    FYI, these pacifiers work well with the Booginhead Pacifier Holder."
"My daughter has been using the original gumdrop pacifiers since she was a month old and we do also have a few soothies just for back up even though those aren't her favorite... she is now almost 19 months old and just gets the pacifiers for bedtime and naptime and she also teethes on them.... the gumdrops are really wearing and not holding up well (i know we've been using them awhile but we've had 14 of the gumdrops) .... when i ordered these first years gumdrops i didn't realize that i was ordering something different than the original gumdrops... when they came in the mail today i noticed that they seem alot more sturdy and durable than the original gumdrops!... now we just got them today but i think i like them better than the original just because the material seems like it will hold up better and my daughter was very excited to get them in the mail too, she didn't seem to notice a difference! also i accidentally ordered a newborn pack as well as an infant pack but i really don't see a difference.... possibly the original gumdrops would be better for a newborn and baby who is not teething?... but i would definitely recommend these, especially once babies are getting teeth!"
Bought these for my new little one and never once has he had any issues taking them.  They smell great and are a big hit.  I am BF and he has had no problems with latching.
These really are great pacifiers.  They are slightly longer making it easier for your infant to latch plus you can't beat the holder that it comes with that latches on easily and securely which is great for travel.
These are the only pacifiers my little guy will use; I love they're size (they don't block his whole face) and also I love how they always seems to fall facing up (I'm not sure why but it helps when he drops them!)
"The Wubbanub keeps the paci from disaappearing in the carseat,  helps keep paci in baby's mouth...if it falls out my son is able to put it back in his mouth easily, the monkey is so cute and is perfect size for baby's hands.  My son enjoys holding it in his hands while he sucks his paci--it helps soothe him to sleep...he has become pretty attached to his wubbanub already."
"While there is no detectable difference between the 0-3 month pacifier by Avent and their 0-6 month pacifier, the 6-18 month pacifier is noticably larger.  I made the switch from 0-6 to 6-18 at 10 months and neither of my twins seems to notice a difference.  It was time for fresh pacifiers anyhow..."
We got a green one from the hospital and our baby loves it. We figure we should just stick with what we have instead of experimenting. We found a similar-looking one by Avent but they weren't the same. Thank goodness Amazon has these. They are exactly the same as the one we got from the hospital except the color but the engraving on the pacifier is all the same. The color for the blue ones is actually much lighter in person than in the picture -- more of a transparent grayish light blue; very pretty though.<br /><br />I personally like how it's one piece so I don't have to worry about loose pieces coming off -- choking hazard. The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well.<br /><br />These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface. I don't use napkins or cloths with lots of fiber to wipe them otherwise they get fury. Most of the time I just run it through warm-hot water and maybe scrub it a little with my hands then let it air dry.
I love these pacifiers because they are the only ones my baby will take. I've tried several different brands and types but he only likes these. He is breast feed and I think these pacifiers are great because they are similar to a natural nipple. I only wish they were easier to find in the stores. Luckily Amazon still sells them.
"This is such an adorable pacifier and has great features too.  One of the best parts about this pacifier is that I do not have to attach it to a string pacifier holder (which could get wrapped around my little one), I would simply just rest it on him and he would push at it if he wanted it.  This sweet little animal is light weight yet heavy enough to stay put in a carseat or while he sleeps in his bassinet.  This product is great, I have had it for my child since he was born, I gave it to him about 4-5 days in as a newborn (which I have come to realize is the best time to give a pacifier to a newborn, it is not too early for nipple confusion and not too late that they refuse it).  He has been able to grasp at it from day one.  He was able to push the little animal back in if it started to fall out or push it out if he did not want it.  The design makes it easier to stay in their mouths when they are so little and are learning to suck.     It is also easy to wash and it drys quickly.  I recommend two so that you can always have one ready to go.    I did see a few other wubbanub pacifiers on sale at Babies'R'us, but when my friend purchased hers I noticed that the quality was not as good, they were much more flimsy and very light weight, making it hard to stay put.   When I was still pregnant I wrote...I love this product, it is so precious and this is the best price I have seen for these.  My friends baby has them and loves them so much, she is able to grab it at put it back in her mouth herself.  I am still pregnant and hoping that my baby will love them as much as my friends baby did.  I love how soft they are and they are a good size, not too large and not too small.  Gotta love the sweet white lamb."
"When my daughter used this beautifull pacifier she looks amaizing, not only that but its really comfortable in her mouth. I recomend it."
"My daughter is 2 months old.  When she was born they gave a soothie pacifier at the hospital. She won't take any other pacifier and they are easy to lose and impossible to find in the dark.  This product is great because you can find it in the dark, it help to keep it in easier by having the monkey laying on her chest, and when she is not sucking on the pacifier she is holding the monkey.   This may be the most valuable purchase we made for our little addition"
"My son loves these pacifiers.  I took a chance an ordered two sets from Amazon and received two sets of pick pacifiers with peacocks.  This seems to be what they have been sending out recently based on other reviews, so if you are wanting girl colors you might want to give it a go.  I don't mind that I received pink and knew that it was a gamble, but probably would not have ordered them if they did not offer free returns."
My daughter loves these. I'm glad I bought in bulk because they tend to end up behind the crib - so it reduces the number of escavations I have to do.
"This is the only pacifier we could get the baby to take other than the soothie, which covers the babies whole face. Very thankful for an alternative."
"Priceless to have a binki that does not fall down by their neck when they spit it out.... it stays put and they can root around for it!  Perfect for the car, or for babies that are swaddled (it sits on their chest without little arms to fling it away) .  My little one loves holding it, and playing with it's ears even if she is not in the mood for the pacifier.  We have the horse, the giraffe and the elephant.  The elephant does not stay put as well as the other two because it not attached to the most solid part of the stuffed animal."
I ordered a spare Wubanub for my 1 yr. old Grand daughter to have when she sleeps over at our house.  This is the only pacifier she uses and only when she goes to sleep.  She quickly finds it in her crib and doesn't need to have 5 pacifiers in there with her.  . It is soothing like a normal pacifier but also soothing in a tactile way.  It goes perfectly with her Lovey which is an Angel Dear Blankie.
"I did a lot of research on pacifiers and these are the only ones we've used. They are rubber, so they do smell like rubber, but that's what I expected and I don't think the smell is strong. My biggest issue has been keeping these away from dog, who has eaten 4 of them (fortunately with zero vet bills...). We got at least a month's use out of each pacifier (assuming the dog didn't eat it first). I would recommend these. A little more expensive than other pacifiers, but worth it to know what is going into my baby's mouth. And FAST shipping!!"
"I love this product!! I would love for the pacifier to have a cap... but other than that is great!! My little girl started using it around 2.5-3 months, before that she couldnt hold the horse, but now she loves it and grabs it without a problem!! It makes it easier for her to put it back when it falls too!"
"This is the first pacifier my baby was able to put in her mouth by herself. She only uses pacis at her bedtime, and even though I leave several simple soothie pacifiers in her crib along with this Wubbanub Kitten one, she always reaches for the Kitty paci first. She likes it so much, we got another one, a Pink Horse, for her pack-and-play at her grandparents. I must say though the Tabby Kitten feels like it's of a much better quality, definitely softer, cuddlier fabric, than the one the Horse pacifier is made of.   Oh, and the baby with the little kitten hanging from her mouth looks really, really, REALLY adorable :)"
We love the giraffe.  Our baby is 3 months and she holds the toy which keeps the pacifier in her mouth.  The design is great that the toy is long and lays flat unlike some of the other ones we got (the elephant for example) and doesn't fall out.  I'd recommend this product and bought it for my friends as gifts.
Wubbanubs are a lifesaver!  Easy to find and we have never lost one in the year that we have been using them.  Would absolutely recommend to any baby that uses soothies!
This was for my pregnant niece who is doing a sheep theme for the nursery - this particular sheep was very small and very cute.
These pacifiers are great. My son wouldn't take any other pacifier until I found these on the internet. They are reasonably priced and a really nice pacifier. He loves them.
"My little girl loves to hold on to things when she is upset, and using her pacifier. This bear made it so easy for her to hold and grasp, plus I was able to switch out the pacifier to which ever one she wanted at the time... truly very cute and I am buying another one for my nephew :D"
"When we were in the hospital, the nurse gave us a Nuk pacifier to calm our baby.  He never got the hang of latching onto it so it kept falling out of his mouth or he'd just push it out with his tongue.  We purchased the Sootheis just to try them and he loves them.  It hasn't interfered with breastfeeding at all (my one concern about pacifiers in general).  It's also really fun to look inside the little hole when he's sucking!"
"This pacifier pod is very stylish and helpful! It goes with us everywhere and is easy to access quickly when my daughter needs her pacifier. I like the snap-on strap to attach it to her diaper bag and it's just large enough to carry two pacifiers if I need to bring a back-up paci. We had a JJ Cole pacifier pod for almost a year before it got lost while running some errands. I replaced it with this one and am so pleased. I like that this Skip Hop one has a zipper closure instead of velcro and it a tad wider inside so it fits pacifiers easier without bending them. I'm not sure what, if ever, I'll use the outer little pocket for, but I would recommend this pacifier pod over the JJ Cole ones."
"I see some people complaining about the size/having difficulty keeping them in their infants mouth. While the pacifier will fall out easier than others, I find that as long as you attach it to something it stays in fine. I use a Paci Plushie (you can buy them online, they are like a Wubanub but you can use any pacifier in them, including these) and it works great. The stuffed animal keeps it in place. If you do buy a Paci Plushie they used to have a coupon code PACI for 1/2 off that still might work.     Overall these are great and is my son's favorite pacifier for use in Maximus (the name of his monkey Paci Plushie."
When my son was a newborn he was very picky about pacifiers.  I must have tried 20 different ones before finding one that he would take.  Now he loves his Nuk binkies and has also transitioned to he sippy cups with teh soft spout
"....well, maybe that's a bit of an extreme statement, but that's how happy I am with these binkys! I looked around for weeks locally trying to find an all-natural, one-piece option. Someone recommended these on a forum, and we've been using them ever since.<br /><br />Some people are put off by their child pulling the binky out with their finger and the loop. It is a minor issue for us. Once she got a little older, the loop works for us - she can easily grab it and pop the binky back into her mouth.<br /><br />This is another standard shower gift I include for new moms. I hate to see a baby using anything else!"
Great and BPA free.  Also nice that they come in different patterns so it's easy to tell which one has been out longer and needs to go in the dishwasher.
"They came wrapped individual packages, like from the hospital. (Sanitized)  Maybe that is why they are more expensive then what you can find at the store... but all the stores were out of them. These pacifiers are a staple at our house, the only ones he will use. It is good to replace every 3 months too..."
My son loves it; and we are very concern in to keep a litle stock in home of Sasha pacifiers.......simply the best
My kids love it;  we are collecting all models; if you are looking the best try to give it to your kids happiness and healthy products
"We have several of Avent's 'regular' pacifiers at home, which my daughter likes and uses on a regular basis.  When I purchased these, the glow-in-the-dark feature was not important to me, as I really didn't expect the glow to last for long (c'mon folks, it's glow-in-the-dark - the technology hasn't improved much since 1985...haha).  As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.  I'm really pleased with these, as I have been with all Avent products I have purchased."
These are adorable and effective. It does a great job of keeping the binky in my son's mouth while he sleeps. He has even managed to get it in there himself a time or two. He also likes to play with it. I was so happy when I found this and even happier when it worked so well. Strangers have commented about how cute and great it is as well.
"It is so simple, but helpful in so many ways: 1) helps hold the pacifier in baby's mouth while they are sleeping - this is number one benefit in my opinion  2) it makes it easier for baby to grab and put the pacifier in by herself  3) If I'm holding my baby and she's got this in her mouth I can easily hold on to the lamb's back leg, so if baby stops sucking, lamb does not drop to the floor  4) in the event lamb does drop to floor, pacifier doesn't go bouncing all over the room like regular pacifier does  5) doubles as a lovie/attachment toy  The price seems like a lot for a pacifier, but IT IS WORTH IT -- definitely  My one complaint, as others here have mentioned, I wish the pacifier could be detached from the toy."
Cutsie Wubbanub is very cute.  Very colorful and useful as well.  I gave this wubbanub as a shower gift.  It was well received.  Would recommend to anyone.  I also bought another wubbanub for the next baby in our family.
"We've been using these pacifiers since our daughter was about 6 weeks old.  We never switched to the super soothie (which is the 2 pack of pink ones you see in the drugstores) because my daughter never took to them.<br /><br />The pink/purple set is a fun change- I originally got them to try broaden my daughter's horizons a bit after my friend mentioned that her daughter was so obsessed with her green soothie that even at 2+ years old she is enamoured with anything that turquoise color!<br /><br />The downside is that now my daughter LOVES the purple one and insists on it by name (papo one!), so to have another onhand, I need to buy a whole new package!  You might be thinking that if one's child is old enough to demand the soothie by name and color she is probably too old to be using this thing?  I say I would think the same thing.  Don't do what I did- break your little one's addition in the 9-12 month timeframe, becuase if you leave it until 20 months (where we are now) it's probably become your child's 'lovey' by now and they are well addicted.  We'll tackle this issue soon, but til then, I need another purple soothie."
The MAM Air is a great product for little ones who tend to get skin rashes from saliva.  The mouth piece allows the skin to dry easier than the other pacifiers.  We love it!
Love these!! Best newborn paci's out there.  I love the shape and I really love the scented ones.  My daughter loved these when she was little and they were the perfect size for a newborn.
Love these for newborns.  They are the perfect size and they have a better shape than the hospital provided soothie paci's.
My daughter loves the MAM paci. We lost both binkys temporarily and had to use a back up but she didn't like it. We found the other binkys and we are back on. Going to order more of the binks today.
"This is awsome!  i really like the little dragon, baby likes it too, it stays in place for the most part as long as she doesn't grab it, but if she falls asleep, it stays right there in case she wakes up."
"This is the most awesome product EVER!! I highly recommend it! My son is tongue tied which means he can't stick out his tongue. All the other pacifiers would constantly pop out of his mouth. I would have to hold it in for him. With this, the little animal hold in his nu-nu. This is my 3rd child and all three have this condition which is not able to be surgically corrected until 4 months of age. I cannot thank whoever came up with this idea enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you!     Ps- It's next to impossible to lose!"
My daughter loves these pacifiers.  She won't use a regular one and we have several.  They are small enough for her to cuddle and I don't worry about the animal smothering her face.  It's safe for her to sleep with and easy for her to reach and keep in her mouth.  They wash easily and air dry in less than a day.
"Hands down THE ONLY pacifier that has worked! (We have 3 kids!) Don't try all the other brands first! Get this one! I love the contour compared to the big hospital soothies and it's soo cute! Should we decide to add to our family, this one will be the one we do. These would make great baby shower gift stuffers too!"
"We received one of these pacifiers from the hospital and they are the only ones my baby will take! They are a little bigger than other pacifiers we bought to try but they are well made and hey, they make for a happy girl! Very satisfied with these pacis!"
"My son loves this teether and chews it from all sides. It's easy to clean, doesn't have any places where water can get trapped, and can be run through the dishwater. I'd highly recommend this teether."
"We loved the parent's choice Soothie Pacifier, but it was just too big for our baby's face. The nipple on this pacifier is shaped exactly the same, but it's just smaller and stays better in our baby's mouth since it contours to the face. We love this pacifier and are very happy we purchased it."
"My daughter got the Soothie binky in the hospital and would only take that kind thereafter. The Soothie blocks their nose and it doesn't seem to stay in their mouth very well because it isn't contoured to their face. I found this Gumdrop one on Amazon and she switched over right away, no problems. I think it stays in better and makes breathing easier (or maybe it just makes me breathe easier not seeing her little nose blocked). It also has a hole for a binky holder, which is great. Another good point is that it is all one piece for safety, and I don't know how my daughter always falls asleep with the binky wedged between her face and the bed, but with the Gumdrop it's not uncomfortable because it doesn't have the hard plastic piece. The vanilla scent is nice but it does fade after washing a few times. It's not that big of a deal for me because I didn't buy it for the scent. :)"
These are just like the Soothie pacifiers babies get in the hospital but in pretty girlie colors! I thought they were way cuter than the big Green one they give you!
"My son loves these pacifiers, he wont use any other kind!  Im so happy Amazon is selling these.  Great price, Great value"
I was afraid the quality would be poor but it's a perfectly standard pacifier. I recommend it for fun and good spirits around you!
"Love these! Before our daughter was done with her pacifier, these were a necessity for when we were out and her binky would drop on the floor. I also use them for toys and other items that inevitably end up on the floor, too. A must for parents of babies!"
"NUK Genius pacifiers are great! We had trouble finding a pacifier that our son would take without a problem and we tried many different ones before finally getting this one. Our son loves it and we have been using them since he was a few weeks old (we are now on size 2). The pacifier is softer than the regular NUK and is shaped in a way that leaves more space for the tongue. It is also very light and has two slits on the sides to allow more air flow. Yes, it's true that the baby can fit the whole thing in his mouth (my son did it once when he was about 5 months old) but there is absolutely no way that he would be able to swallow it. Plus the slits on the sides would not allow him to suffocate either (the air or saliva can still flow freely). The baby can get a little scared if it got stuck in his mouth but that's about it. And by the way, many other pacifiers out there would fit in baby's mouth as well, so there is no reason to deem this one more dangerous than others.    This pacifier is worth every penny and I highly recommend it."
"My son loves this paci.  It is the only kind he will use.  We tried the Soothie brand but he had a hard time keeping it in his mouth.  It was like it was at the wrong angle in his mouth because of the circular shape and it resting against his nose.  I discovered these and thought I'd give them a try.  They worked like a charm.  He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.    Now I will say that it would be nice if the entire pacifier was solid silicone like the Soothise pacifier is.  I had 2 of the Gum Drop pacifiers begin to peel away along the inside where the internal hard plastic form is.  I contacted the seller who directed me to the Manufacturer.  They were more than appologetic and sent replacements and also a return envelope for the damaged pacifiers.  They seemed genuinely shocked that this had happened to 2 of my pacifiers.  Despite this issue with a few of the GumDrop pacifiers, I still think they are an excellent product.  When you manufacture thousands, if not millions, of pacifiers there is bound to be a few defective ones that slip past quality control.  I do not think that should negate the fact that this is an awesome product."
"We tried 4 or 5 different pacifiers (something I recommend), and this shape was the one our baby preferred. It's a bit pricier than other pacifiers, and our baby seems to like the NUK classic as well, so that is another option.    It's a bit tricky to clean and dry, as it gets water into the tip."
My baby used this kind since the hospital sent it home with us.  They began cracking at 7mo. so I got more.  He loves them!!
"This thing is a lifesaver. My son can find his pacifier anytime he wants cause when i put the plush toy on his chest, the pacifier is always within his reach. We can all sleep sound."
"This is the only binky my kiddo will use. We are stationed in Japan, and they are not always available at the PX, so I order a ton. I think it got here in 5 days, which is GREAT considering Im all the way across the world! :P"
I was glad it came with the soothie pacifier since it's the only kind my 4 month old son likes to use. It's also very cute to see him hug his lion as he falls asleep. I highly recommend this product.
Really nice little bear.  My 8-month old loves it.  Super soft and definitely well made.  The strap for the binky is pretty tight and I haven't actually switched the binky out yet but it's just a great little product (my little one actually seems to like the one it came with which surprised me).  Even nicer than the picture looks.
Purchased for my granddaughter and she loved it. Easy to find. Also bought her the caterpillar and little doll. Hospital recommended. They last a long time as well.
"This is the only pacifier my 3 month-old can keep in her mouth for longer than a few seconds. It's curved shape fits around her mouth perfectly, and it's a lot lighter than other pacifiers. Good product."
"we've been using this for about a week.  so far it's been wonderful.  i love it.  the screen is clear, you can zoom in or out.  you can pan up, down, left, right.  it's perfect.  i heard people complain about interference, but we haven't had any thus far."
"great teether and toy.  i don't agree with the doggie toy comments, it's better quality than that.  so what it squeaks, kids love that."
this item arrived within the given timeframe with a little excitment that i didn&uacute;vt anticipate. although it wasn't anything valuable but definitely added value and left a good impression.<br /><br />i would recommend to friends.
"this pack n play was everything i thought it would be when i ordered it. it is rather large (as to be expected with any pack n play). but the changing table is a perfect height so you don't have to bend and strain your back! :) it's super cute and stylish (we went with a green and brown theme to try and tie in baby's stuff with our established earth-tone living room decor- fisher price has a zen collection swing that matches pretty good). the pack n play folds up nice and compact so you can just throw it in the trunk if you're traveling. (the bassinett part and changer do not fold up, but it's still pretty convenient.) i chose to purchase from amazon instead of target because of the super saver free shipping. (same price at both locations) :)"
this is a great dresser but it is being discontinued along with the other items in the set.  i had a hard time finding it avalible but was so glad to find it here on amazon because i saved $100 with free shipping when i purchased the crib along with it.
"This mattress is a perfect fit for my 20 year old cradle. It was shipped neatly wrapped in plastic, so I knew it was clean. It is not too soft and not too hard. I would have to say it's the perfect cradle mattress!"
My granddaughter loves her 'Ellie'.  She also has a lamb 'Lucy' and her green frog 'Fred'.  Very comforting for her and us!
Orderd my Serta Baby Sheep from Pack_rats and I love it. I would definately order from them again. excellent service quick turnaround and sheep is adorable
"I bought these for my daughter, prior to my granddaughter's arrival.  My daughter said she'd already purchased a NUK pacifier and they were supposed to be good.    After my granddaughter arrived, she refused to take the NUK.  My daughter forgot she had these but Daddy reminded her. She tried them and the baby loves it.  It's the only one she takes.     They also come individually wrapped and are already sterilized.  A plus.    Also, as others have said, it's nice because you can put your finger into the pacifier to help the baby get started or just to feel their little mouth.  You can also see through the pacifier too and watch them.    Definitely recommend them.  My daughter doesn't think Grandma's research of everything is so crazy now."
"I bought this right after I started baby sitting my granddaughter at six weeks old. She's 8 months old now, and this has turned out to be the best thing I've gotten her. As it turns out it's a real wrist saver. When I'm holding and feeding her I prop her wubbanub (we call it Wubby)under the bottle and I just barely balance with my hand. She will hold on to a leg or tail and when I take the bottle away she still has Wubby while she's snoozing plus a toy/pacifer when she's awake. Well worth the money."
I keep giving this to my friends as a shower gift.  Thet all RAVE about it because it hooks to anything.  The dad's like it to because they can carry a clean pacifier without having to have a big bag with it in it.  Fits a wide variety of pacifiers and keeps a clean pacifier handy without  having to dig for it when it's needed.
"I can't say enough about these...we had about 6 for the whole time he was using them..no more lost pacifiers and he could easily put it back in himself at a very young age.  Also by a few weeks old he would be petting them as he went to sleep. I had to return to work at 5 weeks and by 3mos he was sleeping 12 hours through the night with the help of this pacifier.  After the first couple of weeks searching for the pacifier in the dark (he was in my bed in a sleeper thingamajig for week 5-10) I found these!! I worried he would have too much of an attachment to the stuffed animal but he was off this and the bottle by 18 months.  Also, the pacifier is the one they use in the hospital so you don't have to worry about switching.  I washed it in the dishwasher and air dried and also just washed the pacifier part often.  we did lose a few at others houses and had to replace 1 or 2 when they were worn but for the extra sleep those first couple of months, it was well worth the $$$."
My son wouldn't accept any other pacifier and I couldn't find them in another other store. I had to stock up!! LOVE THESE!!
My baby definitely prefers the Avent pacifiers.  We like these because they are so much easier to find at night in a dark room.  I just wish the glow lasted a bit longer.
I love this Wubbanub. I would love to have all the different ones. It's the best thing for a baby. Mom's will love you for this gift. Always good to have several around.[[ASIN:B0028IDXDS Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey]]
they don't get spit/water trapped inside like the traditional pacifier.   so they don't get moldy and they last longer. you can put them in the mouth at any angle - great for when it's dark.
"I love these binkies. We were given one for our daughter in the hospital, and its the only binkie she'll use. We've tried other ones but she spits them out. She loves these, so we had to stock up!"
"This was the pacifier that was given to our daughter, while in the hospital. We tried pther pacifiers, but she just did not like them, so we just had to buy some. We love the cut out for her little nose and how durable they are! Love this product!"
"I love Wabbanub!  Soothie pacifiers are, in my opinion, the best.  The animal holds the pacifier in just the right place.  It also keeps it from falling on the ground all of the time, or rolling away and getting lost.  My little boy has had his for almost a year now.  He sucks it while crawling around and rubs the ears with his fingers when he's getting sleepy.  Now I give one to everyone I know of who is having a baby.  This product is so great, I'm sort-of surprised they aren't more widely available!"
"It is so cutie,just the right size for my new grandbaby to hold on to."
My son loves his pacifier and this has been a huge help at night when he was 5 weeks old. Now he is almost 3 months old and he loves to hold on to the legs. I would highly recommend these!
"I love this, even though my baby quit using pacifiers, he still hugs his Wubbanub to sleep. I can easily hand wash/hang dry the kitten. it has proven to be very durable. the pacifier is well stitched to the stuffy. I am very pleased with this product."
Our 2 month old loves her wubbanubs! I would highly recommend for any baby who uses a soothie pacifier. Easy to wash- right in the washing machine!
My son absolutely loves these pacifiers! He was given one in the hospital and wont take any other pacifier! I wish they were sold in stores like walmart so I could buy them instead of ordering them online but definitely worth the money.
this is a great towel set for your baby. the material is perfect for after bath time. the towel is a good size and quality is durable so i know it will last through the toddler years.
"I bought this mattress about a month ago for my baby's playpen; she has her own room, but she sleeps at nights with us.  Mattress is perfect, not hard not soft, just perfect; she loves it.  Most of the time she sleeps on her tummy, and we found that since she started to sleep in this mattress, she sleep maybe 1 or 2 hours more than her usual 7-8 hrs.  Thank you Amazon for carrying such a wonderful product:)"
"My son loves to teeth with this Wub and also likes to snuggle and play with the stuffed animal part.  A great, great buy and we have three different Wubs!"
"This is great for keeping the paci from popping out of an infant's mouth and onto the floor - it just stays right there and baby quickly learns to find it again when they want it.<br />The paci will no longer bounce across the floor and hide under furniture!<br />(I just wish my son took a paci for more than a few weeks!)<br />GREAT shower gift!!!<br /><br />Oh, and to clean it, I just held the paci part under hot water, washed it with soap, rinsed well, and pop it back in his mouth.  When the cuddly-part got dirty, I hand-washed in the sink & air-dry overnight.  (good reason to have 2!!)"
It's the only one my daughter will take since it moves in and out like a women's breast when nursing!! Highly recommended product!!!
"My 2 month old has been using these since day 4 when we needed extra help consoling her.  Unfortunately she loves it so much that it is difficult to have her nap without it, although she will go back to sleep after a night feed without it.  They do fall out easily so there are many trips back to her crib to reinsert the gumdrop but that is the sacrafice I make for getting her to sleep in the first place.  She doesn't wake up once she's in a deep enough sleep when it falls out.  I really like how it is shaped around her nose, giving her more space to breathe."
"bought these for my daughter because they were not only adorable but they are GREAT at night because they usually stayed on her chest when the paci fell out.  Even if it fell to the side of her, they are so easy to find in the middle of the night when you're half asleep!!!  also thought they would be great for her to hold onto when she gets a little older"
"Cute pacifier...everytime Xander wears this, everyone does a double take!  They always ask where I got this.  This is not only cute, but well made & is surprisingly my 9-month old's favorite pacifier!"
Our two-year-old loves this design but it is very hard to find.  Thanks to Amazon she's happy again!
"I have the lamb Wubbanub for my daughter and I bought this caterpillar as a shower gift for a friend. The shipping was very quick, maybe 2 days? The package was new, and it all looked clean and neat. She really liked it!  As for the product itself, I think Wubbies are really great pacifiers for different reasons. The toy serves the purpose as something to give the baby to do. My daughter likes to chew on her some and then she'll put the paci back in her mouth. Using the wubbie, she learned just how to put it back in her mouth, which is very nice. It's also hard to lose a wubbie! I hate searching underneath the crib, or in between a blanket or under a carseat for a single pacifier. They clean easily, just wash in the gentle cycle and air dry. They also get lots of compliments."
"Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry as much about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is really cute and one of our favorites.  I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more beans or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier."

This one is one of his favorites, probably because the head is bigger for him to maneuver and it has the soft mane in a different fabric that he can also touch."

"These are super cute & my son loves it! I was super anti-pacifier when my son was born, but after he kept giving himself hickies on his arms from sucking so hard, I changed my mind. He took to this right away at about 7 weeks old and now at 13 weeks he holds it and pushes it in his mouth himself-too cute! If your baby like soothies (the ones most hospitals use) then I highly recommend you get this! We had no issues with nipple confusion & he still nurses like a champ."

"I love this pacifier...and so does my infant!  I received the catepillar one as a gift and absolutely needed another one in my life because it's so great.  Babies are not adept at holding a pacifier by themselves, so this makes it so much easier as the textured fabric, when set against babies clothes/blanket/side of crib allows it stay put. Keeps baby happy and mom too as I don't have to constantly be putting it back in her mouth."
"great gate has held up very well, easy enough for the older children to open but not the younger ones. is not a gate you want to take down everyday, i just use velcro to hold it open after daycare hours.  if you take it down each time you have to square it up when you put it back up. very sturdy and nice looking, have got alot of compliments on this gate."
"this is a excellent booster seat. as a child passenger safety seat instructor i see all the brands on the market and this evenflo seat really exceeds our needs and requirements. i have a 4 year old son and this booster seat is actually a replacement for a seat that was in a substantial car crash. when looking for a child restraint seat always make sure that you find a restraint seat that meets your child's needs (height and weight) and one that you can use correctly every time. cost is also an important factor when choosing the proper restraint seat, what we did was went to the retail stores found the seat we wanted and then went to amazon were we saved approx. $25.00 plus we received free shipping."
this is a great potty seat! it fits great to the seat as it adjusts to fit snug. it doesn't slide around on the seat like other ones i've purchased. i love it!
"i purchased this for my niece who was expecting her first child. she loves this bag, large enough for all of her baby's needs but not bulky."
"loved this mat! bathtime is not as hard to manage now. my son loves his bath and likes to stay in for awhile, now that i have this i can enjoy it with him."
i received this item less than 24 hours after ordering it.  unbelievably fast service.  and the pacifier is adorable.  my daughter loves to grab the caterpillar and hold it up close to her face.  she isn't good at getting the pacifier back in her mouth but she just turned 3 months.
"i originally bought the saftey first air protect when my 9 month old outgrew her infant car seat about a month ago. i ended up returning the air protect for the following reasons:  1) it did not fit well in the rear-facing position in the back middle seat in our 2005 nissan pathfinder. the front seats had to be scooted up concomfortably close to the dash and the car seat was still not 100% level to ground due to the length of the car seat. it was also very difficult to tighten properly even when i kneeled on the seat and yanked with all my might.  2) the straps were constantly getting twisted. probably every other time i put her in our took her out i was untwisting those *!*# straps. a safety issue--no. but a real pain in the butt when errand running is already inconvenient enough--yes.  3) in the beginning, my daughter cried every time i put her in it. she just did not seem to be entirely comfortable in it.    when i received the advocate cs and opened the (smashed) box, my heart sank because it is a huge seat and i did not think it would fit any better than the air protect. fortunately, i was wrong and the advocate installed very easily and with plenty of room to spare. i was able to tighten the seat very tightly, i think due to having tightening straps on both sides. (i did have to use a towel underneath to make the base level which was also the case with the air protect). the straps have yet to twist and my daughter's head rests in a comfortable position. the seat is very cushy yet supportive and the adjustable straps are definitely a plus.    this car seat is simply a cut above the rest. it has all of the best safety features with little extras (belly pad, recline lever, easy-remove seat cover, etc) that make it an easy seat to use and own. yes, it is heavy (21 pounds), but it weighs less than my daughter so that is not an issue for me. and yes, it is expensive but in my opinion a car seat is not an area to look for a bargain. i am very happy with this seat andam relieved that the stress of trying to find the perfect car seat for our daughter is over."
worth the price and quite spacious. i can take it with me wherever i go and baby is not excluded because he can see through the mesh  sides.  really happy with this purchase.
"i bought this lunchbox for school for my 8 year old son.  it seems to be pretty well made and it has a long shoulder strap that is adjustable.  i cannot find any negative aspects to this purchase, i am completely satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a spongebob squarepants lunchbox."
"Very practical on sunny day and the system work well, a bit sort but I am Happy"
Probably the most expensive pacifier I've bought but worth it. It definitely helps the pacifier from flying out of my baby's mouth. He can also hold on to it too while it's in his mouth. I get a lot of compliments That is so cute. Where did you get that?. I wonder if having the cute animal attached to the pacifier will make it harder for my baby to give up the pacifier later? I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
This product is softer than what you can buy at our local stores. Good product. Very pleased.
"My granddaughter was in the NICU unit for 11 days.The pacifier that is connected to the caterpillar is the kind they used.When she came home, she would not use any pacifier my son and his wife offered her. Then in church, they saw a baby with a wubbanub and how happy the baby was. We searched and found the cutsie caterpillar at a store, but it was the only one. Anyway, when they put this pacifier in her mouth, she was so content and she actually held it to her mouth by the caterpillar.It was such a blessing. with the cutsie caterpillar attached, it stays in the mouth easier and when you need to set it aside, it keeps it from landing on the pacifier.It is a wonderful product.Thank you!!"
"Nice to have as now I can keep my binkies in one place but this isn't realy necessary. Still, it's nice to have one and the strap has a snap on one end so you can attach it to your diaper bag."
These are wonderful to have around not only to clean the pacifier but also to clean my 5 month old's hands when we are out and about. She is constantly putting her hands in her mouth so I love having a something on hand that I know is safe for her.
"I had the giraffe on my registry and received it as a gift... I'm so glad I did because my son loves these Wubbanubs. He won't take the other pacifiers I tried. It is just a Soothie, sure... But my son loves hugging the giraffe and the bear and it definitely makes my life a tiny bit easier because these do not fall to the ground every time it falls out of his mouth. They're adorable too. I only wish there was a way to throw the plush part into the washer and dryer. I don't mind hand-washing but air drying takes too long! That's why I had to order the bear so he'd have a spare. Would definitely buy again."
"The product is really neat, I saw it in an article and bought it for my child that is not born yet.  I think it will be a nice item for the baby if the baby takes a pacifier."
This sheep with pacifier is now part of a small flock that graces the headboard of my bed.    I enjoy them very much.
"I love this thing!  My 9wk old son rolls to his side to sleep, and the wubbanub stays tucked in his arms - he can get the paci back in his mouth by himself, saving me many trips into his room:)"
"We bought every binky known to man for my daughter, and she was not having ANY of them. I could tell she wanted one, but just couldn't find the right way to suck on any. By the grace of god, we found one our first daughters binkys mixed it with her baby clothes. She took right to it. We were so happy. It was the gerber soft center pacifier in the big round bulb shape. I looked for 5 months EVERYWHERE for the same binky. No luck. I even called gerber, and the lady lied to me saying they never sold a bigger version of this kind of binky. She said it must have swollen to that size. Please. I have read quite a few blogs about other moms trying to find the same bigger version. Makes me wonder what they are hidding....I was so frustrated and ready to give up. Finaly I came across this site and it looked very similar to hers. After I read 2 reviews saying the same thing about the gerber binkys, I thought it was worth a try. As soon as I gave it to her, she loved it!! YEA!!! I also love the fact that it is one piece and natural. I have read about another mommy who has this for her kids and she says you most certianly can go longer then 4-6 weeks to replace."
"I searched everywhere locally for a one-piece, non-latex, and BPA-free binky. I finally decided to look online, and ordered these for my daughter. I love them! My daughter doesn't naturally take to any pacifier, so we had to encourage them for a few days. Now she loves them too. I buy them as gifts and recommend them to everyone I know."
"I introduced this to my son at three weeks. He wouldn't take a larger pacifier, but this is small enough to fit well in his mouth, and light enough that it won't fall out unless he pushes it out. Water does get in it when you clean it, but it takes half a second to squeeze it out. We got one as a shower gift, I've ordered two more, and I'm thinking of getting more."
"My daughter started teething at 3 months and we had great difficulty finding a teether that she liked. After trying the ring and the hand, we fell upon the teething blanket. BEST EVER! It's soft and fuzzy and silky/satiny with 2 chewy corners. She loves grabbing the blankie and chewing on the ends. IT ROCKS!!"
"My baby has had the Brown Bear Wubbanub from the very beginning. It is too cute. It was so easy for him to handle when he was smaller, and we never had to worry about him losing it. He is 17 months old now and does not use the soothie anymore, but he still has to hold the Wubbanub in his hand before he can go to sleep."
"My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the monkey being the first one we got for him. He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his wubbas (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.    The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable. I highly recommend Wubbanubs!"
This is the only pacifier my daughter will use.  I specifically like that they are an orthodontic nipple and BPA free.  Size 3 are so hard to find in the local stores plus it's cheaper here on Amazon.
"Our twin boys have only ever used Mam pacifiers.  They LOVE them!  Now that they are 6 months old and teething, I needed to buy the next size.  Well...I received the pink ladybug set!  There really needs to be a gender selection available."
I love this product. My child could not get by without this. This perfect for breast feeding mothers. It also allows you to see anything inside your babies mouth.
I bought this for my grandson and he does not like any of his other pacifiers now.  It is great because it doesn't fall on the floor as rapidly as other ones and he can hold onto it like a favorite stuffed animal!  Saw it on the Today show and had to have one! Soo cute too.
These are the best pacifiers! They don't stick to the baby's mouth and have a natural movement for breastfed babies!
Shipping was fast. Haven't used them yet but I've heard they are what the hospital gives out and are fantastic.
"With the wubbanub we never lost the pacifier again.  It is cute, durable, extremely light weight and we received loads of compliments.  Would have been great and cute to have had multiple wubbanubs stashed around the house and diaper bag!"
"She loves these, only type that she can suck on being so little and all, they are so great to have that I bought more for her! I recommend these for anyone, especially if you have a preemie baby!"
"avent pacifiers are great, last long enough and even though my child is 11 months he still uses 0-3 months size, as recommended by my pediatrician. They glow in the dark, only the handle, and are easier to spot in the crib at night"
When my daughter was born these were the only pacifiers they used at the hospital and consequently the only ones she will use. They are wonderful and she loves using them.
"Cute and practical! I'm able to fit two GumDrop pacifiers in this pouch and slip it into my diaper bag or purse, it's very handy.  I love that it's anti-microbial and reusable, my snack-sized Ziploc bag pacifier storage days are over, and I have even more peace of mind about cleanliness. I haven't had a problem with the pocket detaching or falling off of my bag, I use a Skip Hop diaper bag with two interior key hooks, and I attach the pacifier pocket to one of those. So there is never a problem with detachment or locating the pocket, from personal experience.  I can also maneuver the zipper with one hand, which is always nice when you have an infant in your arms."
"My firstborn rejected pacifiers (we started him on Nuks) and I really wanted our new baby to have a way to self-soothe in the event that I can't nurse him at a moment's notice.  I saw some great reviews for GumDrop pacifiers and decided to try the scented version.  Our week-old infant has taken to the GumDrops since day one, without nipple confusion or any other adverse effects.  They seem to comfort him immediately when I can't nurse him right away, and are the right size for his little newborn mouth.  Definitely gives me a few moments of peace knowing that he's comforted in someone else's arms while I prepare to feed him, and I appreciate the fact that they are hospital grade."
We have a preemie and this toy:  a) came with a GREAT pacifier. Its the Soothie hospitals use and her small mouth can latch on and STAY ON  b) is smaller than we thought it would be but it is still very graspable.   c) we've only had this for a day and she's already learned how to grab it and place it back in her mouth.      This is a must have for preemies and newborns.
"My daughter LOVES her wubba-nub!  This is the best purchase, and totally worth every penny!"
"wubbanubs are great.I have twins who love them. For some reason this kitten one is about half the price of all the others. I'm not  a huge cat fan, but I'm glad I found these cheaper wubbanubs. I was skeptical bc they are so much cheaper than the dog and frog that I purchased last time, but they are exactly the same."
"These are the perfect fit when other calming methods have failed. They are simple and effective. My husband and I got a kick out of them because the nipples are hollow, so you can see into your baby's mouth while they are sucking :-)"
"This is a cute little gift that can be used as a gift or a accessory to  wrapping a gift.  Adorable.  The service was extremely fast, as well.  I received  these pacifiers much more quickly than I expected.  Thanks for the great service  and unique product."
"We were given this pacifier in the hospital, and it is the only one that my little girl has ever had.  She LOVES it, and so do I!  I was so glad when I found them to order since we were only given 1 at the hospital.  I have recommended them to several friends who have used them and love them as well.  It is sturdy, yet soft and comfortable for the baby.  Before my little girl was born, I had bought MAM pacifiers since that is what my first daughter used (until she started sucking her thumb), but when I compared the Gumdrop to the MAM, it was so much softer without that plastic shell around the outside.    I would HIGHLY recommend this pacifier to anyone having a baby.  In fact, I think this will be my new shower gift for all moms!!"
I bought these in order to have extras besides the one given to us in the hospital. I also wanted ones that were more girl since the one in the hospital was teal. This is the pacifier brand recommended me by my pediatrician - luckily it works with my daughter because it did not for my son (he never took any pacifier).
We love this pacifier it is wonderful and does not hit baby in the nose
"These cardinal paci's help make my nephew a cardinal fan from head to toe. Along with his Cardinal outfit , bucket hat and blanket he is a true fan."
"I just received baby sheep with pacifier and little girl sheep with pink bow.  Both are absolutely adorable.  I love the Serta Sheep and lambs and am so happy to find a place that sells them.  I thank you, Amazon for your good merchandise and fast delivery.    Toby Fox"
Baby and mother loved this product..worked great..just remember if you have a dog he will love the smell to and eat it.
Love the Wubbanub and so does my baby. When not in his mouth he likes to hold the monkey. I am planning on giving one to my pregnant friend.
Our child isn't big on any pacifier but he's taken to these ones the best.  They don't have a top or bottom so we don't have to make sure it's in correctly which is nice at night.  They also come with plastic covers that clip right on so when it's in the diaper bag or in a pocket the part of the pacifier our son sucks on doesn't get dirty.
"I just got this paci for my 3 month old son and he loves it! In the picture shown here it looks like the wings are kind of a purple color, they are actually a really bright vibrant blue, which I like better, it was a nice little surprise."
"When we would put my son down for naps he would always loose his pacifier.  With the Wubbanub, it rests on his chest and he doesn't loose it.  Now that he is 5 months old, if he looses it, he finds it again and puts it back in his own mouth.  LOVE IT!"
"These were the same as the ones the hospital issued, only in pink. That is what I wanted, that is what they sent. Perfect."
Mi son loved this paci. Really he felt in love the minute he saw it  Pros:  He could hold hug it and find it easy  Cons:   The cleaning.  I could only wash them by hand (you cannot put the item on the washing machine)  I really recommend this product
"My three month old son LOVES his Wubbanub!  He holds onto the stuffed puppy and is able to maneuver the pacifier into his mouth all on his own, which saves me from washing so many dropped pacifiers.  The stuffed animals are all really cute, and they are the perfect size for little hands to pick up and squeeze.  My son likes to hold onto his Wubba, pacifier within easy reach if he feels like sucking, while he swings and sleeps.  In fact, now that we have one, I am not sure I could get him to go to sleep without it!  I would recommend this to anyone with a little one that likes pacifiers.  Love it!"
"The paci given at the hospital was the only one our son would take.   This wubbanub has the paci just like the hospitals.  It's just heavy enough to stay in place so you aren't constantly having to put the paci back in your infant's mouth.  Then, when your baby is old enough they can hold on to the wubbanub's ears or paws and put it in their mouth all by themselves.  Great for them to carry around when they are older and most importantly the paci is big enough that when dropped it never rolls away - we never lost one!  We bought three.  toss in washer.  It's a perfect shower gift."
I've always gotten the wubbanub pacifiers but the monkey is by far my favorite.  The weight of the monkey helps keep it in an infants mouth and when they get older they can find them easily in the night.  Super great product and prompt delivery.
We just got this in the mail this past weekend and my son loves it! At 2 1/2 months he is able to place the paci back in his mouth when it falls out. He even likes to chew on the giraffes ears and arms! Before he did not like to take the pacifier and would only keep it in his mouth for a minute or two. Now it stays!
"We own 3 Wubbanub, The lion, the monkey and the giraffe. The lion is the smallest of the 3 but works the best in the car seat. Our daughter is 5months old and can easily find him and put him in her mouth. Also makes it esy for us to find when driving."
I thought many times whether I should have our newborn get used to pacifiers but after much deliberation and research- I went for it and purchased these GumDrop pacis.  So far so good.  Our 4 week old baby boy loves the pacifier and definitely helps for him to be soothed.<br />Because it is not one of those orthodontic paci types- babies will not be too dependent on it.
"My nephew is 7 months old and from birth he used the Soothie pacifier and loved it so when he started teething, I wanted to get him something similiar to what he was using and this was perfect, he loves to put things in his mouth and the texture of this is great, although he dosen't like to use it as a pacifier, the nipple is different."
"We have 4 babies and by them having their own animal, we always know who's is whos."
"Purchased this as a gift for a soon-to-be-mom relative. It is so cute, I'm sure she will love it. Arrived in very good time."
I purchased this pacifier for my new granddaughter and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and cuteness. It feels well made and is much better looking in person then in the photo. I will most likely be buying more so we always have one on hand for our little princess.
Matches the JJ Cole diaper bag; easily holds 2 pacifiers; wipes clean; closes easy and attaches to any bag. Meets all expectations. Enjoy!
"We got this at the reccomendation of a Doctor in the PICU.  Our baby boy was always spitting out his paci on accident, or as a game.  The Wubbanub is the best thing since a bouncy seat.  The toy gives him something to hug while sucking his paci,and the added weight of the bear helps keeps the paci in his mouth.  And if the Paci drops it will not roll under furniture (Never good to have a screaming baby while parents are on hands and knees surching frantically for the paci).  I am thinking about getting another just to have a spare on hand because he is gonna love this one to bits."
"Our daughter loves these pacifiers, however, just make sure when purchasing you realize Amazon chooses the color for you. We were not disappointed, we received 2 purple pacifiers."
This is a wonderful and fun way to keep track of your baby's paci.  My daughter is not really a paci baby but she does love her monkey.  It also makes it easy for little ones to find their paci while in the crib.
i bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first baby in 3 weeks. they tested it out and they are pleasantly surprised at how clear reception and picture clairity is. i felt it was a saftey feature as their master is on the 1st floor and the baby's room will be on the second.
"i had not actually seen the frog pod w/toys and was a little skeptical by the pictures, description and the price seemed a little high for bathtime toys since i was ordering several gifts for our 2nd grandson,& thought i could spend the $$ more practically. however, my daughter-in-law had actually seen & registered it at a local baby boutique so when i found the frog pod on amazon for more than 25% off our local price i ordered it. when it arrived, i was very pleased...the quality, the size, the look far exceeded my expectations...the pictures & description did not do it justice...its adorable, durable, practical & fun. my 2yr old grandson & my dtr-in-law love it!"
"this diaper bag is small but cute. looks like it will fit extra clothes, a couple bottles, diapers, wipes and a couple of pacifiers with room left over. will be good for short outings with baby. comes with a cute, color coordinated diaper changer. you can't beat the price. very pleased with this purchase and can't wait to use it when my baby arrives!"
we just ordered this crib set for our baby.  we do not know if we are having a boy or a girl so this is what my husband and i agreed on for an 'either gender!'  for the price we are very pleased with this purchase! it comes in a nice bag and the ten pieces surprised me!  the bed quilt is very soft and feels so nice after we washed it! i really love this set!
i have a newborn baby.this diaper pail is great so far for me!i never smell any odor.i love the foot pedal
"this ladybug has been a major solution for us!!!  my daughter would not stay in her toddler bed at all until we got her this.  bedtime was a big struggle for us until she got her ladybug.  now she goes to bed with virtually no complaints, and stays in her toddler bed!  i also love that the light is dim to begin with, and then goes out after 45 minutes so she can sleep in total darkness for the rest of the night (better for health and development).  i would highly recommend this product!"
"very nice bassinet, would definately recommend it.  i had to call the company and their customer service was excellent.  they told me it would ship in a few days and it did.  very happy with the product and service."
This is the cutest thing to keep with my twin girls' carseats and stroller!  The paci is just like the infant Soothie paci from the hospital and the nipple for the Soothie bottles.  My girls love their caterpillar and baby doll (the princess one).  This one has great textures and lots of colors!
"Quick shipment, item as described.  GREAT during those rough teething months.  My daughter never took a paci but loved chewing on this!"
My breastfed baby resisted taking 2 other pacifiers before trying this one.  I really like that they come with tops which makes carrying a spare super easy!
I am sure a lot of parents are looking for a way to make the pacifier stay in place. Well the little stuffed animal is laying on your babys chest and stays in place. I am very happy with it...less running back and forth to his room to give him his pacifier.
"My son had a heart condition when he was born, so when he was released from the NICU he had to go to the cardiologists where he had many tests completed.  When we were there, they gave him a vanilla scented soothie.  While I personally hate the soothie since it covers up their entire face, it was a save all!  He was so angry at the doctors, that this calmed him right down.  By the end of his visit he was asleep.  When I researched the soothie, I came across these and so far he loves them.  For whatever reason he favors the blue over the orange, but loves them both.  When he's super fussy, we give him these and he tends to calm down faster. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"My baby loves hugging the lion as he falls asleep and stroking the soft satin mane. He is used to the soothie pacifier, which is wonderful for breastfeeding babies, the way they suck on it does not mess up how they suck on the nipple, which has avoided me very sore nipples!"
toy and pacifier in one.  easy for babies to hold.  My son doesn't even like a pacifier but I bought these before I knew that.  He still uses it as something to chew on and it keeps him satisfied when he is in his car seat!
"we have had this monitor for about 3 months now.  we love it!  it is sensitive to pick up pretty much as much sound as you'd like.  the video is incredible.  even in a completely dark room, we can see our little one clear.  i'm not sure what the other reviewers are speaking about when they're describing the flashing led's.  we don't see any of this.  they just stay on with a very dull orange appearance.  the only negative (if you can say that) about the monitor is if you use the video a lot on just battery power, it drains them pretty quickly.  you need to use the video on/off button to take quick peeks and then you're fine.  highly recommend this monitor!!!"
this is a great car seat for an older child.  easy to move from vehicle to vehicle.
"these work very well, so much easier for us to use than the typical difficult to remove snap-in protectors, and stylish, too."
this is really a cute set that goes with all the other kitchen littles appliances.  nice and durable! makes a nice addiction to the other kitchen little sets.
this is an awesome rocking horse that we hope to have for many years to come!  our girls love it and it was very easy to put together.  the cognac color is also a very nice stain!  great price and we felt like we got a great deal!
"this sheet is exactly what i was hoping for - something soft for my baby boy and that fit generously and tailored to the crib mattress.  i had purchased other fitted sheets that were similar, but because they seemed to shrink after washing, their fit was compromised- no good.  i strongly recommend this product as the quality is excellent and just how it should be- i will definitely purchase more sheets from this company in the future."
"i've had this rack since our daughter's birth in february 2009.  we have the dr. brown's bottles with all their attendant pieces (which are really annoying to wash over and over again, but that's a different issue!), and have gone through the 4 oz. size and now use the 8 oz size.  in both cases we have had around 8 bottles \\active\\ at any one time and this rack is truly awesome in its capability to hold all the parts for that many bottles, due to its 2 tiers.  if we didn't have the tube-like inserts which go inside the bottle (to de-bubble the milk/formula), it could hold more bottles, but we use the top tier tines to hold those inserts, and it's perfect.  the bottles mostly go on the bottom rack tines, and all the other parts (caps, nipples, etc.) go in the middle.  other things like pacifiers, etc. can go there, too.  yes, the tines can come out pretty easily but in everyday use this has only happened a few times to me.  and no, this is not a good rack for glass bottles.  all in all, an awesome rack which appears to have much larger capacity than others, while still being (relatively) space-saving due to the 2-tier design."
"based on the reviews, we bought this toy before our daughter was born.  from 1-3 months, she didn't have much use for it.   but, for the last four months, she has really enjoyed this toy giraffe.  it is a small, convenient toy that she can gnaw on and play while on the go.  also, i like the fact that it is made of natural materials.  highly recommended!"
"this is a wonderfully soft and warm receiving blanket.  my favorite thing about it is the size.  it is much larger than the other receiving blankets i've used.  it is easier to wrap the baby up snuggly and he stays wrapped up.  we've used swaddle designs for both of our kids, i highly recommend them!"
"i love, love love these wubbanubs. not only are the super cute, but they work pretty good at helping baby keep pacifier in mouth, plus it also gives baby a soft texture to explore."
My baby was given this type of pacifier at Northside Hospital in Atlanta and it is the only one he will take.  They aren't sold in many stores so finding them on Amazon was great.  If you can keep up with these pacifiers they'll last for a long time - the material doesn't break down like the more common brands and the outter portion is great for teething.  I highly recommend this pacifier but make sure you don't order the preemie/newborn kind... they are way too small.
"this blanket is awesome. the softest ever. it is my two year old daughter's new favorite.<br />also of note, the colors on this blanket are vivid and brilliant. it truly captures the ygg style."
"the product itself is everything wonderful that you would expect from fisher-price. the colors are cheerful and fun and also unisex, which is a great bonus if you'd like to get plenty of use out of this item or eventually pass it along to someone else. the seat swivels so your baby can swing in either of two directions, front to back or side to side, whichever he or she finds more comforting. the little mirrored ball at the top and the spinning alligators and bird are lots of fun for baby to look at. the music is very nice, not annoying, and everything is adjustable - the volume of the music, the intensity of the swinging, the movement of the mobile, etc.<br /><br />what moms really love about this type of product though is how soothing a swing can be for their baby. some people use swings on a regular basis, but i tend to save it for \\special occasions\\ when there's something else i really need to get done, or if i need to get dressed and ready quickly. i'm able to set the baby in here, fire it up, and he stays happy and enthralled until we're ready to go. at first i thought it seemed like a lot of money to spend for something that the baby may or may not like, but i'm glad i paid attention to all the moms who wrote amazon reviews that claimed swings are an essential component in any nursery.<br /><br />the reason i selected this larger style swing instead of the \\papasan\\ variety is because it's comfortable for the baby for a longer time. even though i believe both styles are rated to accommodate babies within the same weight ranges, i believe the contouring and seat shape of this model will prove more comfortable for a longer period of time. the adjustable seat back and removable newborn padding insert will allow you to use this item from birth through many months after."
i purchased this for my daughter and her husband who are expecting their first child (my 1st grandchild!). they love it!
"bought this when our son was 3 months old.  wish we'd bought it the day we brought him home!  our baby was a massive spitter-upper and more than once choked on spit-up.  he also insisted on sleeping on his belly - screamed and threw a fit if he was on his back and just refused to sleep; he learned how to roll over at a very, very young age as well as he was so adamant that he sleep on his belly.  before we bought this i could not get a decent night's sleep for fear that something was going to happen to him - i kept waking up constantly to check on him and every little noise would send me into a fully awake panic.  this product works like a charm!  the alarm did go off a couple of times and woke him up enough to start breathing again or got us up in time to help the baby (it sets off the alarm if no motion is detected for 10 seconds).  it saved my sanity and most likely my precious baby.  i would strongly suggest this to anyone - it may seem expensive but after having used it i would have happily paid a great deal more.  the only thing to remember is when they wake up to eat in the middle of the night you need to remember to shut off the monitor or you will scare your spouse to death when the alarm goes off.  :-)"
i bought this a month ago when my son was 4 months old. he instantly loved it. now he is able to roll around the kitchen and house and is figuring out the many musical options. i have seen the ones in the stores and by far this is the best one. he once spit up too much on the toy part and it malfunctioned. i took it off and wiped it then let it dry and now it works great. i rotate him from the bumbo seat to this and sometimes the bouncy ( he is getting bored with that one). he gets bored easily and this is the one place i can put him that keeps him safe and happy for some time. the only thing is it is difficult to remove the seat to clean it if there's a diaper leak. it is easier to wash it without removing it. i love this walker and it looks fabulous too.
"this item was a gift, so i am unsure how to rate the exact product, but ordering and shipping worked out great!  thx"
"we love these bottles.  we had to find an alternative to glass bottles with removable rubber sleeves because our daycare was worried about shattering glass if they were dropped.  with these, there is no risk of shattering glass at all.  and we like them better than the removable sleeves because no water gets trapped between the sleeve and bottle, which can be messy and annoying.  plus, our removable sleeves, by evenflo were constantly breaking. the only negative about these bottles is that the ounce markers are extremely hard to read, especially when filled with milk.  the price is excessively high so we are managing with only three bottles for daycare.  wish the price would go down so we could afford more."
we bought two of these seats (one for the lexus the other for the bmw) and love them.  the colors blend nicely and the baby is happy.  no complaints.
"i was looking everywhere for a water frog bath toy and this was perfect!  the frogs are made very durably, bright and cheery looking.  very adorable, very perfect.  little rings are perfect size for baby frogs to sit on in the water!  looks like a great pool/bath toy for the babies."
"as first time parents, we were given the choice to use a pacifier in the hospital. after much debate b/c of breastfeeeding, we decided to let our son have it b/c our son was just very inconsolable while my milk came in. nothing worked to soothe him not shooshing, not swaddling, not anything and not even the hospital nurses could soothe him.  this was a godsend! it did not contribute to any breastfeeding problems and has been the best thing to calm our son.  he is now 3 months old and only wants it when is very stressed so he is not dependent upon it all the time, did not have nipple confusion and had learned to self soothe for the most part now by sucking his fingers.  it is really a great product and i recommend it to anyone wanting to use a pacifier for their baby. our son refuses to use any other brand or type but the soothie for the sucking action is calming to him like when he is feeding."
adorable merchandise.  excellent quality.  very fast shipping.  would recommend and buy from again
"the bassinet is very beautiful and is made of strong wood! its not too heavy and was incredibly easy to put together. the only thing that went somewhat awry was putting on the wheels. they would not fit into the bottom of the legs because the inserts were much too wide and long, however this was not an issue for me because i do not intend to roll the bassinet anywhere. but if i need to move the bassinet i can because it doesnt weigh much and is easy to lift.   i would definitely recommend this product. nothing came damaged and shipping was easy."
"this kidsline b is for bear baby crib bedding set is so adorable.  i had a difficult time finding a neutral teddy bear theme until i found this one -- it is perfect for either a baby boy or girl.  the materials are soft, nice, and durable -- not the cheap, scratchy materials that you find in similarly priced bedding sets.  the only difficulty that i encountered was finding the other matching items - lamp, mobile, etc. it appears that kidsline no longer makes this product, so good luck in piecing it all together."
Purchased these for my son's 1st birthday.  He loves to throw and kick balls around.  These are perfect for his little hands. The nubbies make it so easy for him to pick up and hold the ball.  It also makes it easier for him to play ball with his older brother.  Both of the kids throw these around.  They get played with on a daily basis.
These are just like the one they gave my daughter in the hospital.  After so many knockoff purchases that she wouldn't use I finally purchased these and they are great!
"The hospital where was son was born uses these pacifiers. At first I was worried about nipple confusion and concerned that the hospital gave him a pacifier without asking me. Using the Soothie pacifiers he has had no problem with nipple confusion.<br />He LOVES these things. We were given several different types of pacifiers as gifts at my shower and when we got home we gave them to him. He spit every one of them out immediately. The only pacifier he would use was this pacifier.<br />It's shaped the same as a nipple from a bottle and I think that shape is much easier for him to suck on.<br />Like I said, I was initially worried about nipple confusion, but there are some times when he just wants to suck, but isn't hungry. Without the Soothie pacifiers we wouldn't have anything to satisfy that."
My son just hit 4 months. He's been teething up a storm. He always trys to chew on the sides of his paci so this is perfect. His paci with more teething space! I popped that puppy out of the package and right away he was interested in it. I can't believe how expensive some teethers are. This is simple and cute. It looks great with the soothie paci holder.
This is adorable and helps stay put better with brand new baby.  Better to start it right away and very interesting to note this is the type pacifier being given at the hospital to new babies now! All shapes and styles were available on Amazon.  Good shopping place and received in just couple of days!
"We have 3 children and this is the first pacifier that has been enjoyed by a baby in our home. Our son chews on all sides of it.  It has a delightful Simpsons look to it when in use. We have had each size gradation and they really do change a lot. I LOVE this one. If he rolls on it at night, it's soft. I really can't say enough good about it.  I love that it's BPA free and all natural rubber."
In my practice the majority of my patients are infants and children. In my office and in the nursery we offer the soothie pacifier for comfort and infants who will not suck on another pacifier are comforted by the soothie. The wubbanub was originally recommended to me by one of my patients mothers. She has triplets and stated it was a lifesaver. My granddaughter who is 4 months old has both the frog and now the monkey wubbanub she and my daughter love them.
I just bought a bunch of these because they're difficult to find in stores now.  This is our third child to use this pacifier.  My first and third son use/used these exclusively.  My second son preferred another brand but would use these in a pinch.  I have tried many other brands and these stay in better than any pacifier we have tried.
"My almost-three year old daughter has slept with this cute bear since the day she was born!  It is perfect!  The volume can be adjusted, it shuts off automatically after 40 minutes, and it fits snugly to the side of the crib with a velcro strap so that it cannot possibly be removed by infants.  Now that she's a big kid in a big kid bed, she still falls asleep to the soothing sounds, but she also likes to carry the bear around and play with him.  The heartbeat sound the bear makes sounds just like what you hear through the Doppler at the OB's office!  Our little boy is due in 3-1/2 weeks, and we have a bear on the way for him, too!"
"Gumdrop, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.    Bottom line:  Love love love these pacifiers!"
"We bought this as a gift for a baby shower, then had to go out and get it for ourselves. We love it! It is easy to clean, easy to carry, and looks fabulous. Highly recommended!"
"This is a wonderful product.  My daughter likes this brand of pacifier, and the puppy really helps on a number of levels.  First, at 8 weeks, she can grab on to the puppy, helping to keep the paci in place.  Second, the puppy has saved the paci part from many falls (no 5 second rule needed).  Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).  Fourth, it's much harder to lose the paci when there is an adorable puppy attached.  The price is reasonable; the construction is very durable; and the dog is doggone cute.  This is our second  kid and our second round with Wubbanub infant pacifiers (animal + paci); they have a great selection and create a truly reliable product."
"My son got used to this binky while he was in the NICU after he was born.  I couldn't find them at any stores, but was able to find them here!"
"This is our second wubbanub (our dogs finally got to the other after 4 months). We love this thing.  Our baby was given a soothie at the hospital but we needed a way to keep it off the floor. This thing is a great solution. It is easy to spot across the room. When she spits the pacifier out it will usually just sit on her chest and she can sometimes get it back in on her own even without hands. Now that she is getting older she really seems to like the animal more and more. She pets it to soothe herself to sleep and now that she is interested in toys, she always has one near (even when we forget all her other toys). I have never tried any other pacifiers, but if your baby is a soothie baby, then the wubba nub is the way to go!"
"I love this.  Some reviewers need to lighten up.    Our 10 month old doesn't use a pacifier, but we got it in long enough for a few good snapshots."
"old review:  I bought these because my baby likes soothie pacifiers and I thought these were cuter.  As I read the packaging I saw they have a polycarbonate base surrounded by silicone.   BPA is used to make polycarbonate.  The BPA is surrounded by silicone, but if the silicone barrier fails you are giving your baby BPA to suck on.  I did notice the packaging very carefully says pthalate and latex free, but no mention of BPA because it is not BPA free.  Too bad because I do like them better than the soothies, but for me it's just not worth even the potential risk of spending a good part of the day sucking on BPA.  edited to add:  I noticed that they are now listed as BPA free on the website and emailed them.  They sent me back a note that they made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the ones with polycarbonate!  I found that very very reassuring and would now happily use them.   From their email:  Our GumDrop is BPA Free.  We had made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the GumDrop with the polycarbonate guard.  I really respect a company that responds to the concerns of worried moms!"
My son isn't a big pacifier guy but he loves chewing in this thing! It really provides some teething relief for him. He has 5 teeth already at 10 months and this teether holds up great!
My baby loves this. We used to have problems with her paci falling to the floor all the time.  Now it rarely happens.  She spits it out and just stays on her chest.  And it is so cute.
"This is an absolute lifesaver. My 2 month old son tends to lose his pacifier a lot, and the horse holds it perfectly in place. Plus, he loves to cuddle the horse! When he is not using the pacifier, he is cuddling it. He loves to chew on the feet too!    The only con for this is it's best when used in a swing, bouncer, carseat, etc. It tends to pop out when he is laying on his back and turning his head from side to side. But it's worth having! It'll pay for itself when you don't have to keep doing gymnastics leaning over the backseat trying to keep the pacifier in their mouth while driving!"
"These are the best my son loves it. He will not take any others buy this one, it will make you life alot better"
"We had the old Haba pacifier chains (the ones that detach in the middle) and was surprised by the short length of this one; but we found out that this is the new standard length.  Our son uses the Mam pacifiers, the ones without the little ring. A good way to attach them to the chain is to remove the silicone ring that comes with the Mam holder (usually comes free with the pacifiers) and put it on this one.  So, all the pacifiers can be easily attached / removed.  However, with the european style pacifiers (the ones with the ring attached) this holder takes 30 sec. longer to attach. To get the pacifier off, it's a different story, and depends on how wet the little cord gets!   We've had it for a couple of months, and the cotton cord is surprisingly sturdy and shows no wear!  The clip is slightly loose since our son realized that he can detach it just by yanking it."
"We've tried out nearly all the major brands of pacifiers until a seasoned child caregiver recommended this one.  It's the only one my baby will accept, enabling us to use both our hands now that she doesn't have to suckle on parents' finger.  Being able to see inside her mouth while is suckles is amusing as well."
"My 4 month old wouldn't take any other pacifier besides his Soothie, but had such a hard time keeping it in his mouth!  This allows him to either hold on to it or for me to tuck it under his blanket so that it doesn't fall out before he goes to sleep.  And it's so darn cute!"
"Before my baby was born, I had read favorable reviews about the Wubbanub pacifiers, and so I registered for them, thinking they would be nice to have.  Well, now that I have them, I cannot imagine life with out them!  Not only do they use my son's favorite brand of pacifier, the Soothie, which most hospitals use, but the lightweight attached toy is of great benefit by helping the pacifier stay in place!  When my son accidentally spits out the pacifier, instead of it bouncing off of him to who-knows-where, it stays in practically the same spot, just below his chin, provided he does not knock the stuffed animal out of the way.  I like this system better than any pacifier clips I've used because with the clips, he'll spit out the pacifier, and although it is still attached to him, it will likely drop to his side and far from his mouth.  With the Wubbanubs, the pacifier stays nearby more often than not, and any parent who has ever used a pacifier knows that that is a great thing!!!  These are definitely worth the money, and be sure to get at least one for the diaper bag and one for home!"
"This pacifier was my babies favorite. Its just like the hospital one except the little nose part is cut out. Its great! When your baby is little you will feel like the hospital binky is pressing against the baby nose. It isn't, but you won't worry about that with this pacifier. I buy a 5 pack at a time and give one to every new baby that is born to my friends. Its a great gift!"
Loved the teeth. They look great on the babies and are also a great gift for my equally goofy friends.
i love this product. i recently had twins and i use them for every diaper change. its machine washable and has been able to withstand multiple washes for a few months now with no sign of damage. i have about 8-10 of these and they are great.
holds cold very well for breast milk but just not large enough. if slightly larger it would be perfect.
"good buy for the price. keeps your little one safe and secure while comfortable.  allows for growing with the child, with no need to replace at each stage of growth."
very soft and warm. i like it very much and use it all the time for my baby.
"i was just a little perplexed, but quickly figured out how to setup this pack 'n play, break it down and move it to another location in the house. it's very sturdy and useful with its changing bed, and higher bed for our daughter's newborn. i am older and it's easier for me with this play yard to work with my grandchild when babysitting."
this is a nice space saver for the kitchen counter.  you can put your bottles up there after you sterilize and let them finish drying out.  i've tried different racks but i really like this one.  it is plastic and the top shelf is a little wobbly if you have it at the highest height setting and don't have a balanced load.
"what a fun night light for kids of all ages.  casts nice starts and the moon on the ceiling and auto turns off during the night.  the buttons are big so an older child could turn back on easily if he/she woke in the night.  my 20 month old loves it, we lie on the floor and give it lots of \\wows\\.  plus its battery powered so when you travel you don't have to worry about where it can be plugged in."
"i had this for my second son and he loved it, and now i am using it for my daughter and she is a jumping bean now!"
i bought this book for use at our house when our little 10 month old great granddaughter comes over for a visit.  i have pictures of her with her dad and mom and our two pet dogs.  she loves the photo book and carries it around with her.  it is just the right size.  i like it because the pictures don't come out easily and the book wipes off to look good as new
"this is a great little humidifier.  the controls are simple and intuitive.  i love that the water tray is dishwasher safe so i can easily clean and sanitize it.  yes, you have to replace the filters - just like any evaporative humidifier - but they are inexpensive and easy to replace (amazon has them for $9.99). the capacity or the water tank is just right  - small enough to fill easily, but large enough that you don't have to constantly refill it.  we bought this intending to use it in the baby's room, but ended up using it in our room to replace a much more expensive \\ultrasonic\\ humidifier that was impossible to clean and much less effective.  i plan on buying another one for my son's room."
i have a 5 month old and this is a big wow at our house. my daughter is fascinated by the pink color and it is so much easier to feed as only the right amount of food is dispensed each time you squeeze. i have noticed that it is lot less messy than the traditional way. i only wish i had this product with my first child of 5 years. the one that i got had the label 'bpa-free'
"this cover has been awesome!  it has contained every mess.  after almost 5 months, we're just having to order the next size up for my daughter."
"We've had Wubbanubs since our son was 3 months old, he's 8 months now and he loves them. The attached toys make the pacifiers easy to find and hold onto for us and for our baby. We like to keep one handy wherever we go: at home in the nursery or play area, in the car, in the diaper bag, and for daycare. If your baby uses Soothie pacifiers, this is an excellent addition  to your baby gear! Also a plus, Wubbanub  makes the red dog and yellow duck plush toys attached to a lovie-type blankie so when your ready to be rid of the pacifier, you can substitute the blankie and not take away your baby's favorite cuddle toys. I recommend this product to all new parents."
"All I know is that both of my daughters (they are 17 months apart) LOVE these pacis....for some reason, they like the newborn ones, even though my oldest is two.  They really are pacifiers!"
"great carrier better that tne bjorn and cheaper too!  i've tried a few and i like this the best.  everyone uses this carrier the most in my family (and nanay too) becasue my daughter loves to face forward.  carrier is great for back facing too, so my daughter can fall asleep facing me.  this is the best baby carrier from a dad's perspective."
"i have had my joovy caboose ultralight for almost a month and love it. it is light weight and easy to fold and unfold. i have a 3 year old and a newborn, this stroller fit my needs perfect because my 3  year old doesn't like to always ride in a stroller, yet she gets tired of walking. the \\stand\\ part of the stroller is perfect for her, she can even sit down on the little bench if she wants too. the only problem i've encountered so far is that when using with an infant seat the older child does not have a lot of room to sit. however, that seems to bother me more than my 3 year old. i have a peg perego infant seat and it's fabulous that the joovy caboose compatible with that seat. i wish there was more storage, but i new before buying that storage was limited and made adjustments. i bought the j.j. kole diaper bag system that hangs on the handle (works fabulous). i also bought the parent tray for the joovy caboose and that holds everything i need at arms length . . . bottled water, keys, bottle, pacifier, phone . . . i am very satisfied with the stroller and would advise anyone looking at double strollers to consider this. especially if you have a toddler like mine who doesn't want to just sit in a stroller all the time."
"i decided i needed a bag so we could check our our stroller when flying.  we have a maclaren quest.  maclaren sells their own bag for a bit more money, so i decided to try this.  it worked perfectly.  we have used it for both domestic and international travel and it has held up well so far.  the quest fits in it with room to spare, so we are even able to throw toys and shoes in there to reduce some of the weight in our other bags - baby items like strollers and playpens don't count against you as pieces of baggage; defintely helpful in these days of airlines charging for extra bags!  ;-)<br /><br />we haven't taken it through security with us so i can't comment on how easy or not easy it is to maneuver (we generally have our car seat with us and just roll our son through the airport in that, so we don't need the stroller until we get to our destination)."
"Purchased as a replacement for our now defective Safety 1st 900 MHz Sight and Sound Nursery Monitor System (after 4 years of service), we are absolutely  amazed and impressed with the quality of the image during the day and the brilliant infrared-lit night vision of this camera / monitor combination.  Once you have *color* video (only when not using night vision), you will never contemplate getting a black and white one.    At 75 feet and three walls away, our kids' images and voices are perfectly clear when monitored from our bedroom.    Despite what one reviewer mentioned, we have had absolutely NO interference with our 802.11g wireless setup at home.  802.11g operates at 2.4 GHz, and this monitor is at 900 MHz.  There should not be interference.  Our monitor is literally 3 feet away from the access point, and our computers at 50 feet away and even out to the backyard remain connected and working just fine.    We highly recommend this product."
"When my boy looks back on his baby photos a few decades from now, he's probably going to think his father was a weirdo. That's OK. Who knows, maybe he'll get a laugh out of them? Certainly a lot of other people do. Hmmmm. I wonder what the kid thinks when people look into the carriage and laugh at him? When does he develop his sensitivities anyway? I guess I better not use these things overly long. In any case, I've noticed various versions of these Billy Bob Teeth, and I just had to try them out. Sorry, guy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
The infant soothie pacifier is the only pacifier my LO has taken to since she first had one in the hospital.  They are safe and are all one piece.  Solid and sturdy. Much easier to buy online than to hunt down in stores   Highly recommend.
"My daughter has used Soothie pacifiers since she was about a week old. Now that she's in the chewing stage (about 6 mo), we got this one for daytime use. She loves it! It looks funny when she sucks on it because it's so big, but she doesn't seem to mind."
The Blue Super Soothie Pacifier looks like the ordinary green ones but is made of thicker material.  It works wonderfully for older children.  My 19 mos old son is teething and chews on his hands constantly.  He won't use teething toys but he chews the edge of the pacifier.  He could bite through the green ones but the blue one is thick enough he cannot bite through.
My baby's nurse recommended this pacifier when he was in the NICU.  He is 14 months and still loves to carry it around.  I was worried because the soothie pacifier can't be detached but these have lasted 14 months and I throw them in the washer/drier and they come out like new.  They claim to be for up to age 3-6 months but they are actually quite durable.  Soothie makes pacifiers for older kids but not in a Wubbanub.      We get these for gifts for anyone we know is having a baby.  Because they are attached and weighted down (like a beanie baby) they are great for young babies who can't hold a pacifier by themselves.  It'll save you from having to constantly have to put the pacifier back in their mouth.    I love this product!!
"My daughter wanted to constantly use me as her pacifier and I tried every pacifier in the store but she wouldn't latch on to any of them for more than a few seconds. I read the reviews and decided to order a few of these so that maybe I could get a few hours of sleep instead of having her 'nurse' off me all night. They worked wonders! These are the only pacifiers she will use. They are lightweight, which is great b/c they're less likely to wake her up by falling out of her mouth once she's asleep. Plus they are very bendable so if she is asleep on her side they won't put too much pressure on her little face. Thanks Hawaii Medical!"

I have two sons and took the heartbeat bear to hospital to soothe each of them from birth. They are now 6 and 12 years old and still fall asleep within minutes of hearing the soothing heartbeat sound.
Niece loves it!  She carries it everywhere!  She may be too old for pacifiers soon but she seems to not even bother with the pacifier as much as she enjoys the animal.  It seems as the animal has her security pacifier so she is transferring her security to the animal.  Who knows?  She loves it!
I bought the Wubbanub for my 4 week old son because he could not keep his paci in at night. The Wubbanub would still fall out if he didn't suck constantly but it was much better than before. It is lightweight but I think the reason is so it will fall out if he spits up. Now at 7 weeks it stays in his mouth better and he wraps his hands around it; so cute.  This is definitely a great solution for anyone tempted to prop the pacifier. I bought 1 for my in utero niece.
"[[asin:b000v6yi6a playtex baby straw cup replacement short straws: 6-pack]]    excellent product. straw replacements were a life saver to me. i didn't want to buy new cups, but i had lost a few straws and my kids had chewed up a few, so this was the perfect solution. highly recommend."
this sheeting pad fits the portable crib nicely and is soft and thick and waterproof.
this cover fits perfectly over the svan toddler chair. it's easy to put on and take off--easy to spot clean. it fits snug on the chair and doesn't slip around at all. a great purchase to go with the chair
i ordered this for my new little nephew.  my husband saw it and thought i had ordered it for our little boy.  he loved it so i guess i will have to order another one.  it comes in a gift box that is covered with baseballs.  the box is just as cute as the gift.  absolutely loved it!!
"most baby mattresses contain a whole host of noxious chemicals, including pbde, pvc, etc. this mattress contains none of those nasty chemicals and use healthy alternatives. i bought this for my son as well as for my nephew-on-the-way. it's certainly more expensive, but i felt it was worth it for the peace of mind and the health of my child. plus, i can use it for the next one and share it with my sisters when their baby time comes."
i love this nightlight.  bought one for my grandson two years ago and just bought one for a friend.  it's a great gift.
the lionheart seat saver does an excellent job in keeping your car upholstery like new.  i was able to get a tight fit by \\getting in\\ my child's seat while installing.
these spoons are awesome!  they are actually like a spoon in the fact that they hold watery baby cereal or food.  the gerber spoons are almost totally flat and just make a very frustrating mess.  i threw all my gerber spoons away when these arrived.    the only bummer is that shipping is almost the same price as the spoons - but it is so worth it!  excellent product!
i have a three year old and we love these.  they are great and easy to use.  i highly recommend these to anyone!
"My daughter is 10 weeks old she loves the Gumdrop pacifiers, she won't take anything else.  We used the Soothie brand as we were given it in the hospital but they are too big and round and the Gumdrops fit their little faces just right.  I am recommending this product to all new Moms."
"i love this high chair. i would buy it again no questions asked. it is great as an entertainer while i do my dishes or clean up in the dinning room. plastic seat washes easily. great high adjustments as well as reclining. my daughter is 11 months old, we've been using this since she was 4 months old and she still loves it. 5 stars! also is unisex!!"
"great cap!  i bought the pack of 2 blue ones, since most of the bottles we end up buying match those.  so far, they haven't leaked on nestle, dasani, deer park, and aquafina bottles.  they're great in a pinch and we always keep one in our diaper bag and one in my purse."
"i love my new car seat.  this is the third infant carrier i've owned and it is by far my favorite.  things i love about it - easy to adjust strap tightness, fits infants to 30 lbs., seems comfortable to infant, easy to clean fabric, light color to reflect light, infants head doesn't flop when sleeping, comfortable handle, easy to put into and get out of car, carseat base secures into car well, great price for quality, can be used with our old double graco stroller although it fits very tight.  things to consider - it is bigger than other carseats (but it still fits in our camery with backless booster seat on each side, it was difficult to buckle in a newborn since the chest buckle is so big.  i don't think it's too heavy or big to carry around.  i'm very happy with the quality of the safe seat."
its great because of a few reasons  1) the right/left side you could tuck under(vary important)  2) its washable  3) its comfortable  4) water does not go through  but one miner suggestion i would have it should be a little longer
"love this booster. i was a little worried after reading about installation problems, but got it anyway. i have two britax boulevards and love them. it was a little tricky to install, but once i figured out you have to thread the tightening straps through the holes in the seat part of the car seat and pull to tighten, they tightened just fine. i used the latch installation. it is pretty solid. the 5-point harness is to easy to buckle, my 5 year old daughter can do it herself. i love having the added security of the 5-point harness and the side impact protection. go britax!"
"My daughter (3.5 mos old now) LOVES this pacifier! She can actually hold onto it at this age, and we can tuck one leg of it under her stroller or car seat strap so that it is easily accessible to her. We have bought two of them so we have one for the carseat and one for the house - would definitely recommend!"
"We have twin girls that are almost 2 months.  Wubbanums have been a life saver.  When one or both starts screaming, they are instantly soothed by the pacifier and because of the extra weight the stay in as opposed to other pacifiers that fall out followed by even great cries.  Of all the things we have gotten so far wubbanubs has been the best!"
I purchased the Womb Bear for my new granddaughter.  She loves it!  It helps her relax when she is crying.  It also has a velcro fastener to attach to the crib which is excellent.  A Must for a Newborn!
"I bought this for my son and people LOVE it! I am asked all the time where I bought it from cuz they want to get it for their grandchild, niece, nephew...ect I often think Amazon should pay me for the amount of word of mouth I have given on this product... I think if you have a sense of humor and don't see it as some slam against humanity (as some reviewer has) than you'll love it, I think if you do have a problem with it you probably aren't even bothering looking at the product page and or its reviews."
"this product deserves a thousand stars! i can't even find words to describe my gratitude for it. if you have a difficult baby, you must get this swing! after half a day or night of consoling my baby, my back is too aching to keep holding her. i would feel desperate if it weren't for knowing that i can always put her in this swing and she will relax and go to sleep. it has saved our lives! not all babies need so much consoling, but if your baby happens to be colicky, this swing will become your most precious possession. it is of very nice quality- well constructed and safe, with comfortable soft lining. and it works really well. i don't have a single complaint about it. also, the sounds console baby if the swinging alone doesn't work. and if swinging side to side doesn't work, then often swinging front to back will relax baby. it's amazing. i can't imagine how anyone would survive colic without it."
"we enjoy this baby monitor very much, as it picks up on sounds very well. the quality of sound is very good. we put it a little further away from the baby, but the device still picks up on her crying very well. we also love the fact that it chooses it's own frequency, so that you know only you can hear your baby, no neighbors can listen in. the night light is a bit weak and the price is a bit high. nevertheless, it does what it's supposed to do very well and we consider it a wonderful product, with great technology."
"the stroller glides so well it seems to encourage you to move faster. the canopies have multiple positions to block out setting or rising suns. the storage below doesn't accommodate any large bags, though, there is plenty of room for loose items. the twins love the open ride. not a stroller for feeding them if you need a tray."
we bought the most expensive (non-tv) baby monitor at our local \\r us\\ store.  it cracked and popped constantly - drove my husband nuts.  we decided that the price was worth it and bought the phillips.  we love this monitor and cannot recommend it highly enough.  we love the \\walkie-talkie\\ feature so that if my husband can't find something in the nusery - i can respond without having to get up and go find it for him.  nothing at \\r us\\ even compares - we are very happy!!
"great deal,<br />super price for a nice take-along swing!<br />my grandson will love this... and his mom won't have to pack up hers...<br />at this price i can keep this one here as an extra!"
"it covers everything (even for my very active son), plus i easily installed it with one hand on the first try. love it!!!"
"my wife just used this for the first time when flying with our daughter from the us to the uk.  she couldn't be happier.  it did need to be detached from the car seat in order to go through the x-ray machine, but that was simple as it is easy to take apart and re-attach.  it is convenient to not have to take the child out of the seat when changing planes.  it also seemed very comfortable for our daughter."
"I like that these are clear.  Unfortunately my daughter stopped using a pacifier, but when she did use it, I liked being able to still see her beautiful face."
"I use this bear to help put my baby to sleep, or when he is fussy.  The heartbeat sound works well to drown out other noise and is great in conjunction with Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block techniques (the 5 S's)."
"i bought this for my son when he was little, it fits over all shopping carts, and any high chair.  if you are a mom, invest in this, it will save your child from alot of germs, just think what is on those high chairs and grocery carts......yuck!!  i have bought this for everyone i know that is having a baby, and i always get asked where to get one.  note: don't buy the one in the stores that just cover the front and back of the cart, your baby still touches the sides. <br /> <br />katie, tampa, fl"
